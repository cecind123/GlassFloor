rating,review
bad,Bad company to work for the manager was rude and they never for you you had some good Management but my managers was not there for you they never teach you nothing just throw you out on the floor but I already had the skills to do the job
bad,"The management is horrible,  especially since the company is no longer owned by the family,  it's all about corporate now, all about money,  and the keys that the family valued about treatment is gone"
bad,Publix does not have the flexibility that most stores do. With my experience many employees were favored. Also they do not give out raises most of the time. It is very difficult to get hours. Full time is virtually impossible.
bad,Managers play favoritism.  They are allowed to do this because corporate legal office doesn’t not require the same behaviors that they expect of hourly employees.   If you call or report a wrong treatment of a manager this district manager will always get away with it because the DMs back up and support their managers whether they are right or wrong.
bad,"Typical day at work- 4 hour shift with a mandatory lunch break, the company is about business needs not about employee satisfaction."
bad,"Only if you have no other choice, Publix is not for the weak.  Long hours, and little to no organization in the deli or bakery.  Customer service is slavery at Publix"
bad,I have worked at publix for a 4 years and it was a very time consuming job. My job entitled me to awake at 2am and work till 6 in the evening. I worked long hours and very hard.
bad,"Terrible experience working here, because of health related issues they treated me disrespectfully and forced me to quit. They have zero respect for those with handicaps, secondary jobs, or trying to further their education."
bad,This is a difficult company to work for the employees aren’t treated with respect and dignity. There was no support when there are personal issues....
bad,"The management shows too much favoritism as far as daily duties, schedules and promotions. Managers are changed to different stores a lot, so rules change constantly. Dept. Managers have their little clicks and if you are not in it, you can forget it. Hours are not constant  if you are not in the ""managers favorite  group"" "
bad,Since I been here it has so much drama than any other job I worked at in my life . The managers has their picks thata don't have to do anything. I believe they lie just to get you to work there.
bad,"They make it sound great till a few weeks after onboarding n then it all changes."
bad,"Managers are a bunch of tools "
bad,you dont want to work there ever do not try to work here unless you are in highschool they will take advantage of you if you are a good worker and will burn you out quick
bad,"I worked for Publix for 1 year and I didn't like working for the company, the location i worked for was Mount Zion was horrible and the Store manager is not a nice guy.."
bad,Typical day at work is coming in and bagging groceries. I’ve really haven’t learned anything yet. Management is alright they really don’t give credit when you are doing a good job they only notice the bad and not the good. I need more money for dealing with the people I deal with everyday
bad,Treats there baggers terribly wouldnt reccomend workin here.stayed there for 4 year practicly begging to be put in another department with no luck at all. Plus they are notorious for playing favorites.
bad,"El ambiente es muy estresante y el salario es muy poco la lo mucho que exigen,, no me gusto en lo absoluto trabajar para esta empresa"
bad,"Training in the bakery was a complete joke and very overwhelming no one had a sense of organization, You will be told to complete a task a certain way and everyone else will tell you are doing it wrong. I never got the hours i asked for and was promised in the beginning, my co workers were rude to me and no one will do anything about it leaving me feeling upset when leaving work. Upper management was rude and arrogant not only towards men but mainly women. There is this do do do! work work work! mentality you will always be criticized when you did something ""wrong"" but never get any recognition when i did a great job. You will be left alone with no other co workers and work your butt off and constantly get bombarded with things to do and you can never just focus on one task at a time at a reasonable rate, i am sorry but i only have two arms! Publix you think you treat your workers right but you really just focus on the class pets!"
bad,"I began a role as a cashier recently. It was day 3 when I was officially going to begin my role. My Manager had left me in the office saying that she was going to be right back. She was gone for about 2 hrs. She FINALLY came back and blew up on me for not going to 'look for her'. Thinking that we had moved passed the situation she had asked me to go to the front to start bagging.... She decided that instead of moving away from the conversation it would be better to close the door and continue talking about the issue with another manager. When i stood up to her she told me that she didn't appreciate the 'bad attitude'. Yeah, same to you. I turned in my vests same day. I genuinely feel like the company could benefit from a course on soft skills."
bad,Everything was going pretty good until one tragic day. This manager told me I was “too slow” to be a CASHIER. She told me if something doesn’t ring up I should just give it to them. So they just want me to give away food to customers. She asked me if this was my FIRST job even tho I’m 22 years old and cashiering really isn’t rocket science.
bad,I would not recommend working for a company like this. they only care about the money and do not care about you or your career. they treat you as a number.
bad,"Stay away from Publix, no life. work life valance there is none. you can expect to work at any hour of the day and any day. there are only 3 holidays off from the year."
bad,"Very discriminatary, retaliatory, removes all required emoyment safety procedures from work areas, violates HIPPA laws, ADA Laws and i found it bery odd that customers are paying starbucks via price hikes on food. "
bad,"At first it was a great place to work and I was confused why everyone hated it so much. Now I know. Keep in mind this is not all that's wrong with this place! Management is horrible, they dont give you the hours, they choose favorites and laugh at you if you do pretty much anything, if you talk to someone about an issue it rarely gets fixed, if you do anything that looks related to not working ( including use the restroom) they bug you constantly about it. Dont reccomend this job."
bad,"Very selfish when it comes to giving new people hours, despite the amount of hard work given. The appreciation was not reciprocated, which caused me to leave"
bad,"I worked at this Publix for 5 years and was never allowed to become full time no matter how hard I worked. One of my co-workers was promoted before me, who was hired years after I started, just to fill the racial quota. One time I was physically threatened by another co-worker in the stock room and because of his connections to the store manager he never received disciplinary action. I will never work for this company again."
bad,The company is Prejudice favoritism and slightly racism and all Publix I have been to and previously worked in the past I just been silent about it because it's a highly reputable company Forbes 400 blah blah blah that still doesn't matter their millionaire triangle company that brings in all sorts of people but it's so hard to reach to the
bad,"Publix doesn’t care how hard you work or how good you are at your job, only if you’re “buddies” with the higher ups. You could be the best possible person for the job, and they’ll still look you over just because someone friend or relative also wants the job. Good if you’re only gonna be there for a while as you’re in school, but other than that, it’s terrible."
bad,I wish the management at Publix like manager will care to ask each employee basic question how many hours can we work per week to better life the key answer is full time is enough plus benefits. The everyone had a good life.
bad,I loved my job at one time here at Publix but when they moved me to another location and I saw the things going on there it was good brought to management attention and nothing is getting done
bad,"Horrible place to work"
bad,Doesn't pay you for experience. Start your pay at the lowest possible. Management has favorites they give better evaluations to and more hours. Until they got so bad at it that now they switch managers around to different stores every quarter or year which is the best thing they ever done.
bad,"An employee can work hard and receive zero recognition for it. Management can nit-pick at the small things and completely ignore the big picture. They don't give you feedback until it's too late and punish hard working employees. Overall, there is favoritism and they don't treat associates fairly. The stock is overrated too it goes up and down just like the stock market. There is nothing good at all when working for Publix."
bad,"Poor management low salary no benefits until working 1500 hours which is over a year. Must be hired on as part time even if you want full time. No breaks if you are working 5 hours, breaks only if you’re scheduled for 8 hours. I would not recommend anyone to work at Publix."
bad,Terrible. Trust me worst decision i ever made. Managment was hostile. Was written up and suspended repeatedly. Emotionally exhausting. Changed me not for the better.
bad,We were treated like indigents at any given day. Screamed at for not getting ridiculous amounts of orders filled for two people on a shift. We were ridiculed on a daily basis for nor being efficient enough. I came there after being an assistant pastry chef at a hyatt for 8 years. It was very demeaning.
bad,"The interview is a fishing hook with great bait, they bring you in offering success and tare you down with criticism after your hired-your never good enough know matter how hard and tiring you work. "
bad,"They allow customers to abuse you and take their side always, all they care is how much profit they make"
bad,"I've been with Publix for seven (7) years.  I've put in many times for full-time employment, even at the Corporate office.  The secret is, if and when an associate desires to advance in their career with Publix by going back to school, management turns against that associate.  I've had to quit school twice due to the fact that Publix drops my weekly work hours EVERYTIME.  Now they're just retaliating"
bad,"Didn't like the idea of running around rushing to get birds carts in the truck just didn't understand that part didn't like the stupid visors ,the only good thing about it is lunch catering"
bad,If you don’t constantly ask Publix for more hours they’ll only give like 8 hours a week & co workers had taste less behavior while on the clock.there all about favoritisms.
bad,"You can ask just about any employee there, and usually get the same results. This is not a good career choice. Do not waste your time. Management isn't good at all."
bad,"Look elsewhere.  Publix is not what it used to be.  The company is so intent on pleasing the customer, the customer, the customer that the EMPLOYEE suffers.  Also, part-timers have to get 1,500 hours per calendar year in order to be eligible for medical  insurance for the following year "
bad,Managers will lie to you about many things. Begged for hours and would constantly have my hours cut. Found a second job and was taken off the schedule
bad,If you dont work 1500 hours a year you get no bemefits you have to be vested 3 years at ovet 1000 hours per year in order to get free stocks do good luvk to you
bad,"Not enough hours. They do not care if you are a mother with a child who gets sick. If you're being bullied they just turn the other cheek. They cut your hours so low that you Have to leave. When you do leave all of your important information like pay stubs and W-2's are just gone and unretrievable. They do not help you get ahold of any of that important information. No benefits unless you are full time. You cannot be full time unless you have open availability. You get sick like every single one of us humans do, and they cut your hours immediately so they can hire somebody else and claim they are providing more jobs so that they look better. That does nothing for the employees who work there. Fewer hours and more employees just shows how little they care for their employees. I feel bad for George W. Jenkins. This is so extremely far from his dreams for this company."
bad,"Very tight knit if your not in click your not gonna make it.Over worked,not allowed to call in when sick,managers dating employee,.Managers allowed to have favorite associate."
bad,"The management at publix is a joke, they play sides and have favorites. The opportunity for a minority at publix is tough, you cant express yourself if you have natural hair it must be kept neatly as they say. They want everyone to look just alike, sound alike , and act alike. They walk around with the schedule in there hands making sure you are working and if you are not busy they give you busy work to do. The mangers are very ignorant to staff and employees. I do not recommend this job if you are a minority they treat you like an outcast, and try to be slick with rude comments"
bad,"Publix now is not the same as when it started. People used to care about their employees, it became a highly stressful job working 80 - 90 hours a week on salary."
bad,"They do not have clear policy and work you too hard without any advancement . Managers seem to not care about part timers ,and bend the rules themselves."
bad,"I worked for publix for 6 years, the people who work with me was the only gem I had. The constant change in management was horrible, only way to move up at the time was to kiss butt. You don't kiss well good luck getting hours, and if if your not liked good luck getting paid correctly. When I left publix it was the final straw I worked my cut hours only to not get paid at all for 2 weeks. This job pays weekly."
bad,They put everyone in the deli even if it’s not in your skill set only part time make you think you can get full time. Management does not manage their employees no checks balance of employees it was like high school
bad,"Working there originally was a good career, but over time I got sick of it since I never got full-time."
bad,I'm a sociable and approchable person and worked very hard with little complements and very litle compensation for the services i provided for the company. iI would never recommend Publix to anyone!!!
bad,"Publix just sucks, there's nothing else to it. The management says they are flexible with student schedules but they really are not. The only ways to actually enjoy work is to take long trips to get shopping carts."
bad,"Poor Management, No Opportunity to move up, treated unfair, poor pay. There is no such thing as job security because you can be fired for any reason. No opportunity to learn more."
bad,Never again because I have Bad experiences with then is like the let you go for nothing. You can’t be late you have to do everything perfect the way the wan you to do it I don’t mind doing my job but the extra the tresses you out
bad,"I prefer to have a set schedule and not have to have open availability. I don't have time for childish folks that don't do anything, but be in someone else's face. I can't stand that they don't pay for overtime."
bad,"Worked for almost 3 years as a bagger, constantly used and mistreated. Had me on the cash register for 2 years and never wanted to pay me as a cashier despite me asking multiple times. Managers talked down to everyone one of my coworkers quit because my manager called him an immature little kid. Didn't let us drink water even when working in the hot sun. Rolled eyes at me. You name it they did it. The only people that got treated well where the pretty girls. Told them I needed more hours because I was struggling to pay my car and they gave me 11 hours the next week. Would honestly rather be broke and starving than to ever have to work for this company again."
bad,You go in thinking its a great company only to be bombarded by mismanagement at every level. The store managers are literal puppets that cant do much for themselves.
bad,"Mangers are rude."
bad,"While publix may regard themselves as a place where 'shopping is a pleasure', their employees found that working was anything but a pleasure. While they do offer stock options and raises every 6 months, the pay and lack of hours outweighed that. You are not guaranteed a raise every 6 months, you are just assessed on your eligibility for a raise. You have to meet certain criteria to obtain the raise. I spent my entire career at Publix trying to get promoted to full time. Never achieved the full time. Wages were not good and hours were few to none."
bad,I would not recommend working here even if it was the only place you could work. The managers are super rude. They are very fake at first so that you think that you could work and be OK with them but on the first day of work they expect you to work as fast as the people who have been there longer than you. Strict uniform policies. You can't joke around on the job. Manager followed me to the bathroom because I was taking 'too long' on my break.
bad,Working at Publix was different at first it seemed easy but at times the job became overwhelming. For those seeking a position at Publix try to understand management
bad,"This job was terrible, no place to move up in the company as everyone is fighting for the manager positions. People are stuck making $9 an hour until they are 60 years old. The only good thing was the stocks."
bad,I was a stock clerk the location I worked for was beyond terrible . We were a very busy store and always under staffed . The management was terrible to  the employees and my supervisor has no respect for the females in the stocking department.
bad,"Publix likes to wax poetic about taking care of their associates, and making the Publix environment open and welcoming to all new hires, but that's simply not true. You get saddled with horrible hours, and the management is a joke. Everyone ends up becoming worn down and aggravated, and suddenly this 'great environment' becomes a hellscape. Not to mention that your managers expect you to be at their beck and call whenever they want you to come in on your day off. Never have I been so floored as when I was chastised because I had a life outside of work, and dared to not come in when I wasn't scheduled."
bad,"Upper management does not care about you at all. Immediate manager does not care about you at all and will look out for just themselves. I was in management and if you care about your associates you are looked down upon. All they care about are goals, no interest in taking care of their own people or customers."
bad,"My experience at Publix was unpleasant.  I think that all the pre-on the job training did little to assist someone trying to learn concrete skills needed to have success.  "
bad,Working at publix was bad they would act like you were doing good at your job to get you trained somewhere you didn’t want to be and switch you back and forth between departments even if you didn’t want that position
bad,"A bunch of over grown children are in charge. The type of kids that had no friends at all and probably snitched on everyone for anything they could. Probably why no one liked em. So they take it out on the people ""below"" them. Because once they get that tie and name tag. They rule the world!"
bad,"Send educated employees elsewhere.  Publix a place for Indeed to worry about.  I was injured by Publix and they spent thousands on proving it was “Pre Existing”. I worked really hard for this company.. To this day, an injury that occurred on August 2, 2017, I have not been paid any compensation."
bad,"If unforgiving and uncomplimented work and dealing with people ontop of a restricting company policy is your thing then you like it, if not id recommend avoiding. Company policies are pretty strict on what you can and cant do as far as appearance and expression go. And if it doesn't break policy but makes them feel uneasy you be certain management will ""Insist"" you change at a recommendation level. Not much more to say its about the same issues you'll deal with anywhere, foods ok though so I suppose there's a plus."
bad,"Low pay, they never give you full time because they don’t want to give you benefits, terrible schedule, working 10 hr shifts, weekends and late nights. Also they make the staff (cashiers, baggers and more) to clean all the premises including all the restrooms, no cleaning staff."
bad,"I had some of the worst managers imaginable. My direct supervisor once told me ""Stop being so depressive"" and I'm medically diagnosed with anxiety and depression. No one above this person cared or did anything when employees would complain or had any sort of issues with another member of management."
bad,"me working at publix for 2 and half years was amazing i was bagging groceries pushing carts, stocking and cleaning the floors it was a great moment. and i loved every moment of it."
bad,Many days were spent listening to managers discuss personal opinions of their fellow managers and associates with subordinates. When corporate management would visit the store most associates and managers all the way up to store manager would flip out as if they felt they were not doing their job up to the standard when corporate wasn't their.
bad,"Not a very fun place to work because of management, They do not care about there employees like they try to preach they do in orientation. The green carpet culture they boast about is so far from the truth. They DO NOT follow their OWN company values at all. The company is living on a reputation the Jenkins Family left behind many years ago and has sadly diminished since that time. Its a very ruthless, cold, uncared for moral that is constantly getting worse from everyone I talk to that works there.    They have AVS but they do nothing to improve by it. To me, Publix industrial park in Lakeland is no different than all the other companies in the world focused souly on profit. Everything else is just a Curtin(fluff) so you cant see the truth. Until you do...     I hoped and wished that who they said they were was really the truth...I tried and I went in with the drive...they will take it away from you fast...   sorry for the bad news"
bad,Is it okay it's not a place where you start out full time can be very stressful the pay is great if you make decent hours it's also fast pace a lot of standing on the feet
bad,No one there helped me when I didn’t know how to do something I hurt myself multiple time because no one took safety precautions when needing to bc it hurt multiple people not only me
bad,"The managers breathe over everyones neck 24/7. No employee discounts because they're are cheap sh**s. Worst company to work for. They will give you excuses why you can't become full-time or receive benefits. They give you the ability to buy stock which is not even worth your time especially with the S&P-500 and cryptocurrencies. The company is a joke, please don't waste your time at this place!"
bad,They start everyone at part time. They say that you can advance in your career there but I honestly feel like I was going backwards. They would not work me during the hours I originally got hired on for. No proper training in my opinion.
bad,"Publix management does not care what happens to you. They do not care how long you have worked there, they will promote those who kiss butt. They play with your hours and pay and if you are ""out of line"" they will make sure you get no raises and no hours. If you get hurt on the job they don't care and will not pay for you to have time off if you do get hurt. Horrible place to work and I would NEVER recommend to anyone!!"
bad,"I have worked for this company for nearly two years in customer service. It was only in July of 2018 that I finally got the chance to move to a different department ( grocery ). Initially upon being moved to the grocery department, I was under the assumption that I would go from $9.75 an hour to $11 an hour. I thought this because the minimum that part-time employees receive in the grocery department is $11. Since July I am still getting paid like i am in customer service still. I have spoken to the grocery managers and the store managers about changing my job title. After speaking with these managers they would then proceed to walk me through filling out a job title change request form. Upon completing this form I am told it would take about a month for the corporate to approve it. After about five weeks I asked my store manager if the corporate had approved my request yet. My store manager then asks me if the grocery managers really want me in their department. Obviously I am confused by this question since the grocery managers have scheduled so many times during the week that the customer service department doesn't have me at all. In other words I have been being used and they haven't been making any effort to pay me like everyone else. I would not recommend working here."
bad,"Full of idiots which are trained to kiss up to more idiots and lose respect for themselves . The stores are great but the manufacturing"
bad,poor management over work people you go above and beyond and it will never be rewarded they always promise you things they also make up all these excuses for you not to get a pay increase so DON'T get sick or call off my GOD
bad,management was terrible at my particular location. The most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying customers to the fullest extent. What I learned from publix was amazing customer service
bad,If they feel like don’t need you and you can be a good worker they will let you go  they don’t let you show case your self and they pick have there favorites
bad,"I saw Publix go from an ""ok"" place to work to  a complete disaster. Very bad and unprofessional management. Low pays/ wages, low hours to work. Almost not benefits, not hope of ever becoming full time. This place became very unconsidered with its employees and is never grateful to them. Only treats employees as slave-force. Very stressful place to be at."
bad,"The deli is the most stressful, unrewarding place you can work at. Understaffed, under appreciated, overworked."
bad,"Publix is no longer the job of choice unless your young and need a job. This place used to be a great place, but now, not so. The worst is the pay, the second worst is the inconsistent hours they want, can't plan anything when they want a few hours a day from you, works for them, but now for us."
bad,Company makes so much money so so so much and they keep all of the money and dont give their workers anything in return. They barely give full time jobs and they want so much out of you they will try to suck the life out of you.
bad,I did not like it. They did not care about their employees. If you were sick and could not come in there would make ur next week minimal hours to work.
bad,"Publix needs better Managers. One's who keep their Word to their Employee's. Employee's who go ""Above and Beyond"" for Publix Customers should be given Full Time Employment. Not kept at Part`time status"
bad,"When I first started at Publix , it was great! I loved the management and Co- workers! Now there’s favoritism and bullying!! They took away bonuses except managers! The pay isn’t enough to live on ! And you have to have open availability in order to get full time! Even though trucks are at the store by 5 am ! It don’t matter how hard you work when managers have their favorites and will give them full time over the ones who have been there longer! Even if you work your days off to cover for call outs or holidays! I HATE that store!!"
bad,"I wouldn't want to work here again. Dealing with crabby people such as the management, coworkers, and also the customers as well.  Shopping there may be a pleasure but working there is not."
bad,I do  not want to keep reviewing my previous employers. This is a compete waste of time and should be made an optional part of the process rather than required
bad,"Mangers argue constantly with the Ast manager. Poor treatment or employees. Don’t care about part time workers and will never make you full time, hires more part time people and cuts your hours."
bad,Sexual harassment galore they donr care about there worlers at all . they push and push you to your breaking point . i wouldn't recommend it at all dont do it
bad,The culture is poor. management is awfully rude and they have no respect for the workers they have there.  I learned what it means to have no employers on your side to fight for you.
bad,I didn't like this company at all. I got in trouble for making friends. They want you to come and work and not talk to people there. It was ridiculous.
bad,"expectations high with not enough personnel, not adequate training. quality becomes secondary to customers demands. while procedures are good unable to follow. job is labor intensive, time consuming for 1 person. work schedules cannot be followed due to lack of personnel. moral is low frustrations are high. due to these reasons and some others a lot of good employees have left."
bad,I had a very sick child and when I started I told them I could not work Thursday because I had to take son to the doctor but they scheduled me every Thursday then told me I hd to find someone to take my son to the doctor
bad,I didnt like how they acting with me or when pay day comes it would only be like 50 or less a week sometimes maybe 160 or less. I really didnt like it. And i was trying to help my mom with the rent but it wasnt enough.
bad,management is every poor. very unorganized staff because there is barely no crew here. everyone is stressing pulling double the work due to mutiple people walking out
bad,"Apply here if you want to be overworked and mistreated. Management will not fire you but will cut your hours, and give you nothing but cleaning shifts and never explain why."
bad,This job is horrible. Managers don’t care about what is going on in your personal life. Work hard with no respect from others. If you are on the bottom of the department you are treated bad
bad,Poor management resulted in many employees quitting. Short shifts resulted in long hours that employees were not happy to work. Poor scheduling often led to being short staffed.
bad,At first it was good. After a while I was pulling twelve hour shifts for no reason and then I would get 15 hours the next week. The work in iron meant is toxic and draining. As employees we described it as a soulless place
bad,Poorly managed from theDistrict Manager.  It seems like most of the District Managers get promoted with getting as many managers written up or fired .  This is a terrible place to work.
bad,Publix is a warehouse job. You must be able to work hours of physical labor.  You get paid weekly. They have free lunch daily on campus. There are many departments to choose from.
bad,"working in Publix is a very fast moving environment "
bad,i dont know much about it yet.but so far its ok not a lot of hours and managers are not that friendly.but well see. its  a really fast paced store.gbe
bad,"When you work at Publix in order to advance you have to know some one important to advance to a position that you like, even i you wanted to go to a different dept"
bad,"They only care about their customers.  Will always take a customers word over yours. If a customer was abusive,  we had to apologize to them. "
bad,I would never tell anyone to work here not even people I don't like. Management has no respect for there employees. If you confront them they attack your hours.
bad,"As an associate, I was treated very poorly. The store and department I worked in was poorly managed, filled with drama, and refused to work with associates on department transfers, schedules, and pay raises. I was very unhappy in my own department, working in close proximity with people that caused drama and were difficult to work with. I asked the store manager several times to be relocated into a different department, but was met with refusal, and was told my problems lay with my attitude in the situation. Over-all, Publix was a miserable place to work, but taught me lessons in customer service, and how to make the best of a difficult situation."
bad,This job will easily consume your life. you will not have any free time and if you are a college student forget about making your studies your main priority.
bad,If you are thinking of leaving another grocery retail company to come work for Publix because they seem like a great place when you go on vacation don't do it. Publix can be a great place to work if you start with them early and work your way up. They don't like outsiders. They are very inconsistent.
bad,I learned customer service. I got to meet a lot of new people. and the staff was okay. it was like adult high school though. its a he said she said type of place to work.
bad,"A typical day at Publix starts off with Handling multiply tasks at one time, dealing with a variety of customers,and taking care of important tasks in a timely manner. This job has taught me time management skills, how to react to customer situations good or bad, and how to handle large sums of money and personal information in a legal and classified way."
bad,"The benefits they promise are only if you can work a certain average amount of hours in a week if you don't make it, you don't get hours. There is no room for growth they promise you the world and will not even give you the time of day. Don't waste your time with their lies."
bad,"I never want to work for them again, not flexible hours and not willing to work with my school schedule. I quit and moved to a different city and will never work again"
bad,i loved this job when i got hired at my first store. i planned on making it a career. now I'll do just about any job i can find just to quit. banana banana.
bad,"Training is week! Will not fire an employee unless they break the rules. Very bad management. Typical retail, low pay and dealing with people who do not care. Publix is a regional super market based in FL that has inflated prices and markets themselves as benefit to customers with BOGO & coupons (which is changing). It has now expanded to AL, GA, NC, SC, TN & VA. A manager should assist the company make money and train associates to move up. They do not recognize your education or skills. Simply be FT for 6 months and pass a test and you'll be promoted to an assistant manager no training involved."
bad,"I would never go back I was treated with disrespect  and didn’t get paid fairly, the pay raises and equality is unfair between the associates and they don’t do what’s needed"
bad,"Publix is what you make it, the pay is not enough to make a living however it is a great job to have at a young age with no bills to pay. The management has went down hill over the years."
bad,"This company is beginning to become very cheap. They do not want to give raises, full time, or overtime. With that being said, it is very hard to raise a family while working for Publix."
bad,"It’s all about the customers not you , I really wouldn’t work here unless your a full  time worker with a set schedule because you won’t be happy when your hours are Increased one week then dropped the next."
bad,Not enough hours. Make you stay pass closing hours. They want a lot done an a short time span. Have to neatly fix the isles and the products on sales floor before you go home.
bad,"Publix is always portrayed as a ""family company"". In reality, they don't care about anyone. Everyone employee is now just a number. They didn't care when my child was sick and in the hospital. They didn't care about my advancement within the company. They use and abuse people until they don't care anymore, and then turn around and get upset that you have that mind frame."
bad,"They say when you get hired that Publix is a great place to work. Well as a former employee they are very wrong. the management was horrible. I was doing the work of 4 people and still got the same pay. I was doing my job, training others, baking, decorating, opening and closing the bakery and I was promised to get a raise and never did. Gave my 2 weeks notice and the manager threw it away in front of me and said she wasnt going to accept it."
bad,"Productive atmosphere where you are able to learn from different levels and look into advance if you have the qualifications to do so, every six months a paid increase is given"
bad,"Assist manager cursing shoppers when they walk away. Rolling her eyes saying their stupid. Telling me I need to work faster and you better hurry up because this and that have to be done at a certain time! Not helping me when I ask a question that a customer is asking me about, just rolling her eyes. "
bad,"All aspects of store, store management and store associates were terrible.  Other associates didn't treat me right, neither did management.  No advancement"
bad,They do not care about your advancement or how much you do there. I've learned but have no advanced. Terrible work environment and they do not care about when you are there.
bad,"It was really sad to watch a company that I had loved so much go downhill. They would find ways to push elderly employees out the door or employees that had been there that had aquired too much stock over the years. It was impossible to get full time for employees,bc they didn't want to pay for insurance. I watch as employees with spouses that developed cancer over 10-15 years worked all the time to trying to get insurance for their families for 10-15 prior to the diagnosis...it sad."
bad,i had a bad experience working for publix. the management didnt care about there employees and only did what they thought was best for them. The amount of work there was to do did not make up for how much i made. everyone there always talked behind my back and people are very very mean and unfriendly.
bad,The store manager used people as pawns in his own agenda. He was not fair to some employees due to race and some of his employees (managers) were unfair to lower paid employees due to personal orientation. it was brought to the attention of HR but never resolved or addressed and isolated employees til they quit.
bad,"Publix is not just a job, but an experience that you probably will never get anywhere else.  The company is dedicated to top level performance, but also care about the associates tremendously."
bad,One of the best companies for customer service to the customer. Behind the scenes associates are reprimanded for helping customers too much. Most of management is there because of the pay but hate their jobs and they are there because family is in higher roles.
bad,not a fun place to work. Management was hard to talk to and when you did nothing got done really. I would never work there again. I never will shop there
bad,Working for publix was a good experience but in my opinion it was a waste of time. Did not learn anything from working their. Put all my hard work into the job just to have the managers mistreat me.
bad,"I was promised a balanced life, positive culture, and good pay. After over a year of working here I have been denied promotions,pay increases and more"
bad,Management didn't care if you were dying as long as you were a body for their store. Almost died from an allergic reaction but the management refused to come talk to me or let me leave until my shift was over.
bad,I worked there for any years while being treated terribly.  we get yelled at and treated bad and products are not correct. dirty plant as well. the hardest part of your job was not getting in trouble for sticking up for myself and others.
bad,"Management was very abrasive. HR needs to launch an investigation into the store managers treatment of minority employees."
bad,"Managers are rude, hours get cut, and they pick and choose who they like or dislike. I dont care for the publix that i work at. i am just ready to move up in life, and become better of myself"
bad,They start out everyone in the customer service department and lie to you when you ask about moving to other departments. Raises are pathetic and they promote people to management who can barely manage their own lives.
bad,They are the worst place to work at. They will not promote you no matter how hard you work. With them its not about what you know its all about who you know and who you blow.
bad,horrible enviroment to work in. very stressful. employees bad manners. managers unorganized. selfish and jealous attitudes amongst management. terrible customer service
bad,I liked the workers and some managers but not a recommendation to work sometimes you won't get hours at all and I got paid good but the hours isn't really good.
bad,I would not recommend this job to anyone. Publix is not a fair place to work you do not get paid fairly and you do not get treated fairly either. This is the worst place I have ever worked.
bad,really if you cant have a open schedule then your chance of full-time are out the window ..is a great place to work but if you are adult with children and have a home along with bills then publix is not the place
bad,"I had some serious problems with the management at Publix, not only was I undermined and disrespected as an employee, but the had some serious issues with keeping my confidentiality. I went to the hospital for a few days and had to call out of work, and by the time I got back everyone had already known everything I had just been through"
bad,place is not to stay. get your experience and your little money and get out. do not stay with empty promises of management. do you want to wake up every weekend to deal with angry entitled customers complaining about little things?
bad,Everybody is trying to act like this place is amazing and its not they do not treat their associates right and under appreciate their associates for trying their best. They will constantly say we are not trying to fire you as if they care but really they are trying to save money. I wouldnt recommend anybody to work here.
bad,Managers are evil they treat you like you're a number. I tried to commit suicide working here. Long hours no pay raises. The customers are mean and expect too much out of you. I was in misery for 5 years. 5 years too long if I knew this job would go nowhere I would have left day 1. Had benefits there once lost them because they cut hours so bad each summer. If you have no money saved up don't work here. I had $98 paychecks to live off of for months.
bad,"Overall good company don't go to work to hang out. Baggers do not last long they work them like slaves. Cashier's do not get frequent breaks. Customers curse at you, you are required to stand thinking they are right. Managers tell your personal business."
bad,Publix is no longer the organization they use to be so well known for.  They treat their associates and management very poorly.  There are a lot of discriminatory practices occurring especially towards the older workers.  They are trying to promote younger workers that they can pay less and terminate the tenured employee that made them a great supermarket leader.
bad,"A typical day at work should always be proactive, giving your personal best at all times."
bad,Gotta kiss but or know someone to get anywhere God forbidd you actually want to have a life. Advice never say no or request a day off
bad,"My overall experience with this company was an unpleasant one. Overall unprofessional, uncaring, tried to have employees work of the clock, tried to cover up employee accident on site."
bad,Don't work here unless you are in school or retired and looking for some thing to do. The pay is terrible and the managers are incompotant
bad,working at Publix can become demanding sometimes and then it's a normal day at work.Helping customers always bring a smile to your face.
bad,"When I was pregnant with my first son, I was forced to do work that I was told not to do by my doctor."
bad,Horrible starting pay. This is not a job to work hard it gives you nothing in return. What you should do is play the game. What game is that its called the old boys game. How much you can suck up to the district manager so you can get that promotion.
bad,"I worked here for 6 plus years, This is a very good job for a high schooler, but not for someone needing a job for a family. They are very stingy when it comes to full time"
bad,"Publix doesn't train, doesn't pay well, and doesn't really care about their employees as they would have you believe. poor pay and only beenfits that are good are the ones that go to full timers, which are only a select few of the workers."
bad,"A typical day at the Guntersville Publix includes standing on your feet for eight hour intervals sometimes 10 hour shifts with only one lunch break, and a 10 minute break if you have the 10 hour shift. You cannot leave your register until someone from customer service or upper management tells you to go, and when they feel like it or if your replacement decides to show up. Bathroom breaks are few and far between and you have to hurry along only when there are no customers. The upper management's strategy to keeping employees is that they tell the workers that if they stay there, they are going to basically get rich off of the stocks. Unfortunately, you have to wait a full year to get stocks. Benefits begin only after a part-time person reaches and maintains 1500 hours per year. The problem is that if a manager likes you, you accrue hours, and if they don't like you, then you can average approximately 9 hours per week, which will take forever to reach 1500 hours. There is favoritism with the upper management. The employees also have to work as janitors in the evenings after working on a register and bagging groceries the entire day, only to go and mop floors, clean bathrooms, take out the trash, etc. until 10:30 or 11:00 whatever time you were scheduled to leave. Then you have to get permission from management to leave. It's a very physically demanding place to work. The upper managers do not help with cleaning. Upper managers are hired from within, which explains why the lack the professionalism, as they start out as baggers and cashiers with no education or social skills. There"
bad,"Long Hours, minimal help, horrible management."
bad,"Advancement opportunities aren't fair across the board. You get promoted if you are friend with managers or go against morals and values. "
bad,"The retail industry is going out of control when it comes to quality care. Corporations keep adding duties to the pharmacists but keep reducing our help hours. Publix in particular, has xtra bagers and cashiers, standing waiting for customers and they quickly open a register when more than 3 on line. Well NOT in the pharmacy. We can not use any of those xtra kids, that to me, is a QUALITY issue and I am an example of it."
bad,"A typical day is mainly just standing at the end of your register. In doing so you don't learn much about the work place. The management is careless and neglectful. If you're sick or having an allergic reaction, they expect you to continue to work out your shift. The co-workers don't want to be there so if you actually do your job, all of their work will be pushed off on you. The hardest part of the job is fighting for hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is going home."
bad,"Don't work at Mcdonalds, they have no organization and they will only use you. There is no benefits or room for growth. And its like being back in highschool with all the drama."
bad,"I worked the evenings I would over see the clean up of the deli, sometimes making sub sandwiches. Cooked chicken, wait on people as they order meats and cheeses."
bad,I was not happy at this workplace. In my interview I was told of quick job advancement It was never that easy to achieve. Your efforts are seldom noticed and job advancement is not what your told it will be.Once your there it takes years to reach management.
bad,Working hard to help each customer at a fast pace time manner and lottery machine and moneygram customers also im here to serve for my customer thats called awesome customer services.
bad,Working at Publix was like being in high school. They were drama in every department and everyone was into your business
bad,"Publix was fun until I moved out of my parents house, my manager found out and thought it was a horrible decision. After that when I needed help with a customer is was my fault the customer was having problems with the store, my fault I couldn't go home at the end of my shift and if I did leave I would be fired, even though my shift was over. I was a cashier and scanned items the customers wanted and gave them there correct amount of change, kept my till in order, and cleaned my register frequently. When the store was low on baggers I had to fill in. My first time bagging, my co worker was rude and snotty because I didn't go out and get shopping carts and she had to, even though my job was cashier not bagger."
bad,Mcdonalds was my first job an to say I like it but I wanted something better. you learned different things all the time. the coworker was friendly an nice.
bad,worst place to work at. Worked at this company for 8 years and has changed so much during the course. Managers are all about making a profit with little concern for the employees. High stress.
bad,"a grocery store, a lot of product to account for. customer service skills increased. money management. long hours on your feet"
bad,"If you enjoy slow work, then this is a great place to work. Not many advancements. Good place for younger kids in high school."
bad,Any typical day at Publix was fun and I loved staying busy. I learned alot about the deli industry. The management at the store I worked was awesome. I enjoyed all of my co workers.  We worked as a team. Together Everyone Achieved More. I don't feel there was a hardest part to the job. The most enjoyable part to the day was seeing satisfied guests in the store.
bad,I had to leave because they closed the store. It was a terrible move. I want to work at T-Mobile instead with their better benefits. But MetroPCS stopped me from leaving
bad,A typical day at work is exciting getting to meet new people everyday.I learned that customers that like you will come thru your lane and even ask about your day...I love working with my co workers they are like family...
bad,Treat employees horrible. Overwhelming work load with little pay. Worked years without being made full time. Never have enough help. No praise just write ups. Reviews on various websites are fed in by upper management.  Employees like fellow employees but management needs overhauled.
bad,"If you don't want to have a life or money work here "
bad,The most enjoyment in this job is the customers. My co-workers are hard working and a enjoy to work with.
bad,Working with people and helping your employees grow. The company is growing fast but in other states.
bad,"Worst management i've ever had! The co-workers are fine, go in at 2 or 3 in the morning and stock shelves, seems simple right? NOT! Get yelled at every day for the stupidest of things get written up for things you didn't do. All mangers are idiots and blame you fro their mistakes."
bad,"hateful lady care nothing about her employee, has people work with kids with no license to do so, very illegal ."
bad,great starter job. best place to get a start in your career. bagging and ringing groeries hardest part of the job working with rude customers best part having a job
bad,it blows have to work a year before qual for full-time pay aint good they are not flex with hours what so ever
bad,"I really did not enjoy working at Publix, for the simple fact that there schedules were not consistent."
bad,"The main reason ""outsiders"" work at Publix is for the benefits.  The majority of the management team running the benefits area is uneducated and unethical.  The company prides itself on integrity but the majority of management in benefits doesn't have any.  They are consistently fined/audited by regulatory authorities and will eventually realize they need to outsource or hire someone with ethics and an education to properly run the department.  There is no work/life balance as they expect you to work absurd hours because they remain understaffed due to their belief in ""running lean.""  It's called abusing and exhausting your associates."
bad,Refer to resume. The resume tells you everything you need to know about this job.
bad,"Very abusive management and hareful, short-tempered employees. Training was an absolute joke. Forced to work with dangerous equipment without any training. General Manager has no idea how horribly under managers treat workers. I was called names, physicality assaulted, and made to feel completely unwanted from the very first day. Can you say uneducated, redneck bullies? They go through employees like water. Don't work here. You've been warned."
bad,"confusion through the store no structure "
bad,Thought it was a terrible place to work. There was no training and terrible pay. I started working 40 hours for the first few months and then it dropped to 25 hours
bad,Not worth the pay. The bonus cash for working on Sundays is no longer in effect for new hires.
bad,"Never at a job have I been treated so badly. Front service clerks are all rude and chummy chummy with each other but if u are a new commer u better watch out, they don't like new people. Also, the front end clerks are VERY immature. They do not do their jobs and so they leave them for the new people to do. They like to throw their authority around like they own the store. They honestly treat u like dirt. Publix, answer me this, why do I have to ask permission to use the bathroom? Or take my break? Or to leave at my scheduled time? You need to re-evaluate ur staff."
bad,"I worked cashier, it went bad from the start. I was told I would get 40 hours but when I got there the managers told me they never hire full time people, I was getting 10 hours a week. You have to ask for your break and lunch. God forbid you need to go to the bathroom even when there is no one in line or even in the store they will refuse. They messed up my paychecks and put them in someone elses account so it took me over a month to get paid. Also if you are a bigger person and take a size xl or bigger you will not get a shirt that fits. I was told not a problem they gave me a 3xl which is really a large and made me wear a guys uniform. I had to keep telling management sorry you don't carry anything above a large so dont hire fat people. I left after a month of playing the hours and pay game. Dont waste your time just go to a temp agency they will find you something better."
bad,"over worked and under paid, is not what people think its supposed to be like, they do have good benefits but overall are not the company i thought they were"
bad,"Supervisors will expect you to come in early, leave late, and work on your days off. Work hours were 8 am to 10 pm, no lunches (due to salaried), no breaks, then told one couldn't eat behind counter within site of customers, not allowed to leave building (at all), and discouraged to sit down. Health and dental insurance was awful, had to wait 1 year and 3 months to see a doctor (and I worked over 40 hrs/week). Dental only covered cleanings and minor fillings for the first year of paying premiums. Attempts to manage employees are undermined. Management is unfair and one-sided, only making decisions to benefit the ones they favor and not those who work hard and increase profits. Unethical and illegal behavior is accepted as long as the customer is happy. It therefore is a great place to shop and patronize, but a horrible business to have a career in, unless, you are in the Good 'ole Boy Club. I learned from this job that companies don't always analyze workplace performance, increased business, and profit when making decisions."
bad,"Too bad there are no stores in this area, or I'd be working for Publix Supermarkets, Inc. still.  I worked for them in 2002, till 2004 when I relocated to South Florida. Was employed again by Publix in 2010 when the need for deli workers was heavy, sent where needed. Will return to Publix someday. they run their business efficiently."
bad,I did not care for the Publix store in the villages fl management did not care for anyone under the age of 35
bad,enjoyed this place to cause you seen all types of customers come into the store from the mean to nice ones. I couldn't check the boxes at the top
bad,"Good company on paper . Very hard to move up .I been working there for 9 years as full time , I had to go part time with them . Its very hard for a african american to move up at publix."
bad,"Publix like to say what a great place to work it is and that they give you benefits and all that nonsense. The truth is that their benefits are sub-standard, they don't give you a raise when you get a ""promotion"" (you just get more work), the management doesn't care about the hourly workers (because the managers move stores every few months and don't get to know the workers), they will fire you with no warning for the slightest infraction if the manager doesn't like you for one reason or another, and they play favorites with the employees like its junior high. Oh, and they are staunchly ANTI-UNION! They talk about being anti-union like its a good thing... Warning bells went off for me right away when I heard that. I worked there for two years so I am speaking from experience. I am a very hard worker and put up with way too much nonsense at publix. "
bad,"As a part-time employee there was no advancement, benefits, and low pay with equal stress compared to full-time."
bad,"No chance for advancement, but some of my co-workers were great"
bad,"you have no cameras, and as an lp you have to be on your feet your entire shift, not worth the pay,and your Dlpm is lazy and wont have your back..."
bad,again it seemed as if the customer was the greatest part of the day....interaction with people made you forget about the bad managers......It would help if you wanted to work for them....to not have a mind of your own
bad,"I went into this job hoping for the best but not preparing for the worst. I was what they call a ""bagger"". I mostly thought that this job was for men, but boy was I wrong. The minimum wage pay as well as the small hours id not make the work experience any better. At the time I was also caring for an ill parent."
bad,Bagging groceries.
bad,I was a housekeeper and i was treated badly knowone knew english and i felt they were talking about me i hated this job.
bad,The management at the publix I worked at were very racist and made working there very difficult.
bad,"Its almst like pulling teeth to move up at Publix,If you know some one you have it made"
bad,"They tend to overlook the ""mature"" employees for the younger ones.  It's a great place if you only want part time.  However, the store I was at not only looked over older employees but made it clear they ""advanced"
bad,"No room for advancement unless you sell your soul, company quietly restructuring to do away with peoples positions. Higher ups enjoy abusing people that have a backbone or heart."
bad,"They starve you. One week you could have 27 hour another week 4 hours. They have clicks and if you do show potential the managers find it threatening and will do what they can to hold you back. You don't get benefits unless you are full time and only a selected few in their click will ever get full time. They will schedule you a 3 hour shift no matter how far away you live with no consideration. You are forced to take abuse from customers. They will give customers anything they want so they won't complain to corporate, therefore the customers are very unruly. I often cried on my way home from work and would have sickening knots in my stomach on my way to work."
bad,Management will throw you under the bus to get what they want. Hours are not promised. The most enjoyable part of the job is the other employees as long as they are not management or are trying to become management.
bad,"While working at Publix I quickly learned that there was a peaking order, though not the one that you'd expect. The main manager and assistant manager always seemed like they where never really in charge of the section but instead that was placed in the hands of our seafood specialist who is a foul woman in every sense of the word. She would do absolutely nothing during her shift except make a mess and then leave it for us to clean up and she would constantly be so rude to customers that she once even made a newly wed couple break down crying because of how she kept insulting them. However, she isn't the worst one there. That goes to the Meat Manager a close second is the Store manager themselves. The Meat manager was pretty ok at first but once he found out that my mother was his high school crush, I became a target for him and I believe he blames both me and my mother for why he's still single. It got so bad that he outright demanded that I work off the clock by only taking a half lunch but staying punched out the whole time. After a month of doing free work I went to the store manager who is rarely, if ever, at the store and she manipulated my punch times so it showed that I was taking ridiculously long lunches.(1.5 - 2 hours) After all this, the meat manager started cutting my hours to about 2-3 hours a week and making sure I had almost no hours in general so that way I could get little to no pay. This is my nightmare from working at this company for a little under a year and I seriously hope that something is done about these horrible people abusing their power."
bad,"Managers expect so much out of you with little pay and no overtime. If you get so much as a minute of overtime you will be written up. Most stores are underemployed or corporate lacks the benefit of the doubt to give stores more hours. In my time I've seen bonuses go away with a one time raise. You get an evaluation every six months but usually, they will bombard the evals with petty issues to make you think that you could've done better for a raise than $.25. Managers are usually uneducated and devote their entire life to the store as do other managers if moving up is what you want in life."
bad,Bizarre cultlike culture. Only way to get ahead tlis to be very nasty to co-workers. Was mislead from the beginning about advancement opportunities. Only able to get benefits is to be full time which requires at least 5 years working part time at least 40 hrs a week. I thought 40 hrs was full time but I guess not at Publix
bad,"When I would have full availability they would schedule me for one day, but when I would request off they would approve and then schedule me anyway. Extremely unfair treatment among employees. Management was very rude to the employees they didn't like and they would never have a reason why. They chose favorites and made it obvious and would talk bad behind employees backs. "
bad,There  is not much to learn at this company . It is a Grocery store with  Management  that is about themselves dishonest  overpriced and will  work you to death  and they don't care .
bad,Poor management handling. Lack of professionalism though most of it I have learned about customer services and hope to give the best i can for customers!
bad,Publix isn’t for everyone! The company itself is okay but what you endure during the time you work there isn’t pleasant. I did however learn superior customer service skills during my employment there.
bad,good if you're in school. management is not cooperative. not flexible. there is definitely favoritism.  not good enough pay for the stuff you put up with.
bad,My worst working experience in my life. Customers can make complaints against you and get you fired. But at the same time if customers make a positive comment a great deal of the time it's never acknowledged. Management racial bias discriminatory. For black person there's almost no promotions or advancement advancement. Particularly in my case.
bad,It was a busy place and had to work fast. It became physically hard of a job for me. I got hurt so I had to quit Publix. I left the company due to job being to physical hard .
bad,"Been working for Publix close to 9 years. Proceeded to worked full time schedule since I took a break from school on the graveyard shift 5 days a week for 3 months and still have not received full time status. Managers say that I have been doing a great job and full time will come soon just need to see that I am reliable. I guess three months of no call outs and doing a great job isn't long enough...maybe in another 3 months it will happen."
bad,"they are poor they have clicks and if your not in the click you dont get a chance to move up "
bad,"After working there for 5 years I would never recommend working a job at Publix to anyone. Across the board most employees have the same pay rate as a new hire even after putting several years of loyalty into the company. They do not care about you as a person as they portray themselves to. Do not have a health condition and work for Publix. You will be punished for it by having your hours slashed down to next to nothing even when having fmla. Coworker literally got in trouble/written up for being a team player because someone else wasn't. Many broken promises of promotions or department transfer to be left in the same position while favoritism not hard work allowed others to be promoted before you. Constantly short staffed because the turn over rate is very high. Unless you are prepared to put this job before everything else including your family....you will not get anywhere with this ""family oriented"" company. It is not ""Where working is a pleasure.""."
bad,"This company generalizes the opportunities they offer. Although there is definitely different career paths to choose within the company, you must gain seniority before really being considered for a better position. This results in several employees dedicating years to Publix without having an opportunity for advancement. This company also loves to preach about being a family oriented culture yet has zero tolerance and understanding for serious family emergencies that conflict with work days. The lunch they provide is basically public school cafeteria meals from US foods. Working for this company makes you feel like a number rather than a human."
bad,"Employees are promoted but not groomed or instructed on how to be an effective manager,.  Managers use their power in scheduling to retaliate if you speak up or disagree with them.   Publix DOES NOT like older workers.   They will schedule them for fewer hours and basically force older employees to leave/retire."
bad,"Supervisor terminated me over not disclosing medical information but florida is a ""right to work state"". learned to bite my tongue but did not get further training although I was persistent in attempting to learn and grow with the company... disappointing to part as I did have 6 years vested."
bad,Management doesn't care about your problems or your job title. if you work at publix you basically are gonna end up doing a little bit of everything at some point. Some people work there and do the job of 5 people and only get paid for the job they were hired for. They take advantage.
bad,"People always stabing you in the back, and you are not inportant to Publix , Publix only cares about you if you are management and they let you you are nothing"
bad,"It is very demanding and you must be able to deal with drama. You must be able to tune out your other co-workers. It is fast paced and you get very little training. Instead of being a team, you are often on your own."
bad,"They claim to be so welcoming and family friendly. Schedules are done day before you have to be there so you cannot have a life. Management is a joke. Pay is unrealistically low, can't even afford to shop where you work."
bad,Horrible place to work. It is becoming like Wal-mart.If you want to work somewhere that gives you a few dollars a week as a start out job then it's ok. Very physical on the body.
bad,Where shopping is a pleasure and where working is not so pleasurable . Working there when they promised job security in the beginning lasted for about a month then they offer the unqualified full time and leave the others out to figure it out on there own . You’d have to work two jobs just to make ends meet because working for little to no hours didn’t compensate for the weekly pay . The manager was good and understanding but the store manager wasn’t good for much. Very condescending and not much help .
bad,"This location is strictly for the hourly worker. I would NEVER suggest someone go into management here. I am not sure if this changed since I was a manager there but you are Overworked and underpaid. We had to work a required 50+ hr work week with a lack of resources. the environment was VERY stressful. As a manager, you have NO work-life balance."
bad,There are so many things about Publix Super Markets that even the managers do not know. For example when you work at Publix you have to stay in the same position for at least six months to a year before you can advance. I was asked by store managers and assistant store managers to work in different departments and I had no idea that this would hurt me moving up in management .
bad,Horrible place to work and I was honestly wanting to make a career here and after seeing how they literally treated my manager till she walked out those does scares me to want to be a party of this work environment
bad,I’ve been here a year & a half. They won’t hire you full-time. So no paid vacation or sick days. They seem to have a clique here & you can’t advance or get full time unless you’re young. Hard to even work a 2nd job because your hours are so varied. If you change your “availability “ they drop your hours. YOU CANNOT live in what they pay unless you’re in school & live at home.
bad,I was working part time about 23 hours per week. Couldn't even work another job because they wanted all availability. Horrible place to work. The manager was distasteful and ill-mannered.
bad,"During the season time, it is fast paced there. However, if it is just a regular day, it is sooooooo slow.  The customer service manager was not the best. There is clear favoritism shown. Advancement was nearly impossible there. That job was way too serious for no reasons whatsoever."
bad,"If you are looking for an environment you feel trapped in and if you dont have a life and dont plan on having a life, publix is a perfect fit for you."
bad,"I worked here for 11 years and had almost zero life. I worked nights, weekends, and holidays and if I did take a weekend off they'd schedule me 11 days straight! Really difficult to get full time."
bad,Terrible working environment. No loyalty for employees from middle management. It is not a pleasure to work here. Not enough tech hours for the volume. They do not care about the pharmacist.
bad,Overwork and underpay workers managers are disrespectful and don't really listen to associates. Overall would not work for this company longer than two years.
bad,"Politics, politics, politics. If you have a sponsor within management you will go far. They want as many part time people as they can. They promise full time, but you never get it. most of the poor management is barely out of their teens with the maturity of a five year old."
bad,"Treated like garbage from the interview until the day I walked out, your last day at publix will be the best day of your life. they will intentionally schedule you so you cant work another job..wouldn't want you to get ahead. They want you to starve with 425 dollars a week after taxes."
bad,"any number of tasks are required. anything from slicing custom meat orders to making sandwiches to frying chicken. none of these tasks are easy, and are only made more difficult by the procedural hoops one is required to jump through and a sense of entitlement on the part of the customers."
bad,"been with company for years, regret ever working for company, overworked, below average pay. no short term disability. no regards for employees personal life, company always comes first. very few minorities or women managers above store level (only good ole boys)"
bad,Helping customers
bad,"Never felt empowered,felt like I was casted to the side play favorites with certain employees department manager always lied about things he didn't have to lie about felt misled mistreated alot of double standard never had a chance"
bad,Management technics are out of date and unmotivating. Some coworkers are great and others are cold and bitter. Almost everyone there is looking for another job.
bad,"This place is not for you if your not Hispanic, white or butt kiss , if you are any of the above go ahead and apply you will fit right in and will climb your way up easily"
bad,"The customers that come in are rude, demeaning and management says they can treat us like absolute garage and we just have to take it, also a lot of double standards, management will single people out and have a ""talk"" with them when others do the same thing with no repercussions. They give you way too many hours and not enough pay, I was doing jobs that only management was doing at previous jobs and I wasn't being paid nearly enough for it. The standards for working were not consistent, what one manager said was a rule was not for another manager which made it difficult to know what to do as rules were constantly changing. Loved my coworkers, but would not go back to working there. I've heard Florida is way better in terms of working environment, it's too bad they couldn't bring that to Virginia."
bad,"Will never work here again! Publix doesn’t care about their employees. Managers were lazy and rude. The benefits are a joke. Awful hours and they won’t schedule you if you’re not full time, which they make extremely hard for you to get!"
bad,was alright loved the associates but store manager and meat manager are corrupt at wakinsville ga store management needs to be cleaned out and start over it was stressfull deceit and full of lies not properly train you then set people up thats a real problem when I worked there
bad,You have to work 1500 hours a year to get benefits. When you get to 1300 hours they cut your hours so you don't get 1500 hours means no benefits. And forget about getting full time. They are so picky who the give full time to. Summer hours get cut. Every years they give it to the high school kids.
bad,"It’s looks good from outside but once you are in it’s horrible , they really don’t care about you, just wonderful words but actual life is totally different"
bad,In order to move up in this company you have to be friends with all up management. Doing your great exceptional well will get you no where but over worked. Florida market may be better than the Virginia market. Pay is pretty good though.
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend anyone work here.  It’s stressful and they nit pick you about every little thing. More scolding and belittling than actual recognition of good job. If anyone tells you it’s a good place to work, don’t believe them. It’s only good for management and up."
bad,"they will hire you in temporary bases part time position."
bad,"Management is selective, doesn’t treat staff evenly. Plays favorites, scheduling is biased & advancement opportunities are segregated. Open door policy, requests to speak with management about concerns are waved off, avoided. They’re hiring “just bodies”now, instead of properly screening applicants. People came to this store with expectations based on how they were hired. Deceptive hiring practices."
bad,If your not grandfather in then you are not going to get far. The hiring process is quick but you do not move up the food chain at all. I wouldn't recommend working here unless you are going to put in a lot of time.
bad,"wasn't happy at all, poor management and they played favorite.hours were terrible and you have to be really flexible if not they are going to cut your hours."
bad,"This place is the absolute worst , they promote who they want to promote ... one wrong thing your hours are cut , the way the managers play favoritism is horrific. If your not full time don’t expect many hours as a part time employee. I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone unless you are desperate for a job ... the lack of communication between the department managers and store manager is terrible!!!! they don’t care about you they are just worried about their bonuses and customers ... the only thing positive is my co-workers were amazinggg and that’s the only reason I kept this job. This job was so depressing .."
bad,"I do many things, I do counts, randoms, attendance receiving, I check and print prices, I put the prices, I check my orders in order to accept or reject the input of some products at the store. I  manage the MASC of products in order to reduce or increase the quantity of the product on the store."
bad,I worked in the Deli so i cant speck for the rest of the store. In the Deli there is always something to do. My managers at my my store didn't know how to talk to people very well.
bad,overall this was not a good place to work .This place is horrible to work for the majority of Publix dot give full time job to give you benefits or paid time off . only good for teens and older people who dont have  many bills to paid
bad,this deparment is a bad place to work it is very stressfull because management makes it that way. there is nothing enjoyable about it. this company doesn't care about there people anymore.
bad,"No help, expensive health benefits, not enough pay, no more bonuses, all the good employees have left for better paying jobs or other pharmacy chains.  Publix used to be the place to work, but now that is becoming wal mart since they have staffing and better pay.  I am doing 3 technicians jobs as a part time employee and the pharmacists are there by themselves half of the hours of operation every week.  the managers are terrible and only care about the numbers because that is what their bonus is based on.  They do not care about the pharmacy staff or patient safety.  We cater to low income customer base and deal with mistreatment on a daily basis.  Their bad contracts with insurance companies and free meds and 7.50 plan are costing them more money than they make.  They are using a Sync and central fill program that has failed and was abandoned at other retail pharmacy chains to replace tech help. They do not value their good employees at all."
bad,Publix is a very big company but always mantains customer relationships good but dosen't keep a positive work environment for employees cuts hours without notice in several depts does transfers with prior notices. Changes schedules with informing you of changes.Allows managers to be rude and down grade employees .
bad,working at publix was very stressful bc of how the management expects u to do everything on your own without no help. they also do not pay their associates enough money for the work they expect them to do
bad,"A typical day for a stock clerk at Publix depends on the time your schedule to work. Mornings when you clock in you throw truck (stock the items that came on truck the night before.) Coming in the afternoon you maintain the store and block the store for morning and overnight crew. The over night shift a worker would throw back stock and birds to make room for truck in the morning. As for the managers the grocery manager was the best one. He is very considerate and like to have fun while still doing the job. As for the other managers they're not as great. I only learned more about the grocery job, but other than that nothing else. The workplace culture is good. Most of the workers that are employed there are nice and very easy to talk to. The hardest part of the job is when other workers don't do their job and as a result more work gets put on the workers who are doing the job, which happens all the time and part of that, the blame has to go to the management. It makes workers feel unappreciated as well as the way they make schedules are absolutely horrible. For me the most enjoyable part of the job would be the co-workers. Most of the co-workers I work with are very fun and easy going but also do their jobs while others mess around and cause more work for others."
bad,A typical day at work for me is hectic at best. I often leave after an 11 hour day feeling emotionally and physically drained. I am pushed beyond my physical limits to the point of injury for the sake of producing goods. I am only as good as how much I am producing. Management spares no occasion to let you know that you are replaceable.
bad,"Working for Publix was a big mistake. I'd heard good things, so I was excited to get in on the ground floor. But I was hired as a bagger at less than what I had been making at my previous job, despite other less experienced employees being hired in the same position for a dollar more. I'd been promised to be promoted to cashier almost immediately, but after six months and four new cashiers I gave up and quit."
bad,if you are applying for stocker don't! they make you work hard for what they pay you and expect you to stay over your time to do more work even if you finish your job.
bad,"lack of training and utilization of corporate tools, daily schedule adjustments without notification, does not follow corporate policy for lunches, unethical work practices by pharmacists,"
bad,"Corporate was okay for females in power, but not okay for females in areas that were male dominated. Any questions of diversity were met with punishment and hazing."
bad,No good benifits for people who wish to use this place just to bring money in for college is meant for people who need a retirment and have no college degree
bad,Disorganized and incompetent managers run the system while associates are underappreciated for their hard work. better management needs to be put into place and more opinions should be heard from the associates.
bad,"Cannot guarantee a set amount of hours, Management is out of touch with reality. Select people are favored over others. Hard work will get you nowhere."
bad,"if you are lucky to get hours, you have along day because they are always short staff, you usually do the work of 2 people, fill specials and anything morning shift didnt do while maintaining your isles blocked and presentable and answering questions customers may have and physically helping find items. also returning misplaced items from your isles to correct isle, if you are closing you need to clear the back room, empty out cardboard compactor(s), take out the trash, swipe floor, organize floats and birds, re-stack/condense items that are on special, if specials and ending you have to remove displays and put up new displays. before you go home you have to have every special filled, along with the displays, and have whole store blocked and ready for next day. you dont enjoy anything about this job, you basically hate the job more everyday that pass, managers dont care about your work load, they find any reason to not give you a raise, hours get cut randomly, the only good thing is if you work enough hours you qualify for a bonus. moving up in the company is basically a popularity contest with the managers and higher ups. Publix use to be a great company but as of late theyve removed old management and hire a large part time work force to have a small full time work force where they receive all the benefits."
bad,"Customer service,payroll,schedules,ordering,bank deposits,audits,stocking, unloading trucks, coaching & training,interviews, open & close, etc"
bad,"To be perfectly blunt, the typical day at work is primarily mind-numbing on average, and the quality of customers greatly influenced the quality of the work day. good customers made the day go by infinitely better."
bad,Its a awesome place to work if you are in the right store.
bad,Publix have favoritism with employees one week you’ll get 4 hours the next week you’ll get 10 all because you’re not the managers favorite. You basically have to kiss butt to get hours.
bad,"This job all comes down to the department manager. If you have a trash manager (like me) you will hate every single day. They don't care about you at all because you are replaceable. They will mock you behind closed doors, they will cut your hours, anything. If your department manager doesn't like you for whatever reason, they will abuse their power and nothing will be done about it."
bad,Managers will lie to your face and promise that they will fix problems. Hours are inconsistent and everyone hates being there. Terrible place to work.
bad,Working for this company and succeed can be ver challenging. At Publix it is all about “who you know”. I worked there for about 10 years and it is not the company what it used to be.
bad,"I worked at Publix Pharmacy for over 5 years and I didn't like it because management worries about adding more money to their pockets instead of worry about customer's satisfaction, where shopping is a pleasure, not true at all. People had to stay in line for pick up for hours and managers had to lie to customers despite of their medical issues. We don't usually call Physician's office for refill or if something wrong in the prescription, we don't inform customers about third party rejections, simply because we don't CARE and don't have TIME to get the job done properly as we promised ""where shopping is a pleasure"", Managers are pushing techs to work faster and faster to build up STATS= More Bonus, more money, happier life, not for the customers."
bad,It was a struggle to work there. I made my personal problems known to my managers when I was being hired. When I realized my position was not working out and asked for a department transfer they dragged their feet.
bad,This company does not have room for advancement or job security.  Low wages and managers are stuckup and don't help there staff. Work long hours with minimum pay.  Rude employees and policy rules don't apply to all stores just certain ones.
bad,Every day depends on who your manager is.  Management is sorely lacking in managerial skills.  I just work orders and tell you what to do and when to do it and have expectations of getting things done even though when they were in your position they couldn’t complete the tests in the time allowe. They need more training. But that is just not gonna happen.
bad,"Awful company that doesn’t care anything about you or your work life balance.  Management does"
bad,"Publix is turning into the new Walmart. "
bad,"Unrealistic goals with unrealistic time limits. Never enough help with the job load. To stressful for the pay amount. Hours are never consistent and hard to take days off for family. Not able to call out when sick due to managers yelling at you and telling you, you are not a good manager."
bad,"Poor management,  skeleton crews I have not seen since the recession hit in 2008, alot of favoritism, most workers who are full time get set schedules and they give you the shifts no one else wants to get, and if you say anything the manager will say to stop complaining, they also expect too much out of the workers considering you have to work with skeleton crews, during orientation they make company look great but it is poorly run, the managers do not know how to make schedules, if we are short staffed you cant have everyone come in the sametime and leave nobody working the other parts of the day."
bad,I just need a different place to work. Closer to where I live. And plus the people you work with like to start rumors and they just ain't nice. I would like to work somewhere different.
bad,"If you're sick and need time off, oh well. You could even get a doctors note and still be considered absent from work. I was having allergy issues working with raw chicken, and was breaking out with a rash. The doctor said I had a contact dermatitis coming from the raw chicken. Did my manager care? No. Even after telling him what the doctor said, him acknowledging what he said, and saying he wouldnt put me in kitchen again, he did anyway. So I went back to the doctors and got a note stating I couldn't be in kitchen, and than they started treating me like garbage, even my coworkers who were only mad because they had to be in kitchen more. I was in their everyday by myself busting out all the cooked food you see. They treat you like garbage."
bad,"Slashed benefits constantly "
bad,"Upper managment doesn't care about you as a person. Only want the job done and any cost. The enviroment created for customers was always top notch, but behind the scenes was never pleasant. When I became a manager the company had just changed them from hourly to salary. This created an enviroment where I was working over 90 hours a week and was ""motivated"" by the store manager consistently starting off the day with ""do you want to be fired?"" I was fine with working there before I got into management. The only benefit from the hellish experience was just that... The experience of how to run a tight ship. Now I know how a manager should be thanks to the torture they put me through."
bad,"The salary they offer is no where near worth all the stress, energy, and patience required. These people will have you running back and forth constantly which is extremely exhausting for such a minuscule salary. If you work part-time, they won't even give you at least 20 hours a week. I would always feel anxious to show up to work in fear of the stress that I would have to deal with from both the managers and the customers. The managers act like they are so nice and sympathetic and they speak of Publix as if working for them is an amazing opportunity. I would often go out of my way to do several different tasks (which they did not require me to do) for the sake of keeping things in order and hopefully getting recognized for my good efforts. Instead of being recognized for the things I did, they would complain. They saw me do a mistake once and then quickly assumed that I always do that same mistake consistently."
bad,"Management has no regard for the lives of their employees, just the progression of their business. They would rather make people quit and hire inexperienced workers than try to work with the people who have put their sweat and tears into their work each day."
bad,Very cut throat especially from management. Lots of gossip and inequality in how issues were handled. Definitely at this location not living up to the Publix brand with treatment of employees.
bad,All the management was interested in was playing games. They overworked me to lessen the hours of the long time full timers so they wouldn't have to pay so much. I joined the company to work maybe 20 hours a week max to help pay for college but they had me working a minimum of 35 hours a week and it interfered with college.
bad,"I worked there for a year. I was promised so much and given so little. I was treated like garbage because I wasn't drinking the kool aid and being BFF's with the management. It's like a cult, working for Publix. Long story short, it's not worth it. Your better off going to Walmart. The management in Publix is unreal and cocky, don't bother moving up either unless you want to have no life and work 60+ hours a week. You can't have a life if you want to work here. Also you have to be on your toes now since they fired a manager who had been with the company for 11 years, they fired him for eating a piece of stale bread as it was being thrown out. MESSED UP! There are children starving, and this multi-million dollar company is willing to throw away good people over a piece of bread. Worst company ever."
bad,"Everyday was very fast paced, I couldn't slow down much, because either the customers got angry or my manager did, there was barely any communication between co-workers and had an unapproachable, also because of the fast pace quality wasn't at it's best and helping every individually and having the aura of a personal bond between employee and customer (which it's what publix is known for) was impossible with most customers. "
bad,"The customers are extremely rude. The pay is absolutely terrible, unless you want to live on the street or out of a car. the benefits are apparently good according to managers however i fail to see that along with 99% of the coworkers i have spoken with on this subject. The scheduling is very annoying, one day you close then you have to be back up in two hours to come back for another 10 hour day. Overall a bad company thats given a good name by people who clearly havent worked here."
bad,"The Management is bad, they don't care about you they just want you to work so they can sit on there lazy butts. I had a very bad experience working here. I just moved from the Midwest and someone told me it would be a great place to work for they were wrong. Save yourself the trouble and stay away! Specially the publix in date city."
bad,"Company is best for people with no / limited skills that have worked poor jobs in the past and want to be “grown” by a business that will trade you $40 / share stock in exchange for low wages and a minimal benefits package. Management is unqualified, thankless, undertrained and out paced by subordinates, which means that talent often leaves and forces the company to retain “C” students. "
bad,Strictly by the book kind of place like a military setting. not environmently friendly. very wasteful on paper. only advantage of working here is they have a lot of location.
bad,Managers over staffed and never gave hours to those that were loyal for the years of working their. They over worked the employees and treat us like everyday garbage.
bad,Micro managed. Very condensating. Did not appreciate hard work. If they didn't like you they would intentionally make it uncomfortable so you would want to leave
bad,"it very quickly went from something i didn't mind to being horrifically awful. i would only recommend it if you have no options left. they work you a variable amount of hours as per there need with little to no consideration of what your need is. (sleep, pay, or otherwise)"
bad,I worked at Publix for only a couple months as a high school student and it was fine to begin with but as time went on the management in the department I worked in was not easy to talk to and went off of the word of others than talking to you. they also would cut your hours with no explanation.
bad,awful working their managers threaten to fire u every day or cut hours even tho your fulltime they treat workers like garbage hours are always changing they won't tell you if they changed them so if ur late they blame it on you
bad,They over work you and don't appreciate anything you do. Very stressful. Customers can treat you terribly and management won't do or say anything because the customer is always right. Terrible experience.
bad,"Stocking shelf with the product. There is absolutely nothing to learn."
bad,"Not a good place to work. Very overpriced to shop there. People work 10 ,12,15 hours with poor pay. Even managers think they are not getting paid well. Most of the managers are jerks and not very nice people. All employees are always exhausted and overworked."
bad,"Favoritism in management is outrageous, It is not a family oriented built culture. Pay is not worth the stress of dealing with customers and management."
bad,"Publix's Information Security departments are led by management who have not evolved past 1999.  Many responsibilities are checklist items, which they are not interested in improving.  The associates are great to work with but are stifled by management.  They completely oversell their benefits to prospective employees.  Certain departments run the company regardless if it makes Publix less secure."
bad,"It is a terrible company, while they treat the shoppers like they're royalty they treat the employees badly. If you're over 25 you can forget about advancing to management. They won't give you the 15 minute break you're suppose to get by law. If you ask for it they make you feel bad about it."
bad,I had no time for my family. The work load was to much for one person. People call out everyday and then the management puts their work load on you
bad,"Just not a fun environment.  Management sits in the office and ignores customers.  Favoritism runs rampant.  Coworkers are backstabbers so that they can get on the managers good side.  Most of the customers are great, others know that they are at Publix so they can treat you like poo with no recourse."
bad,"Where to even begin....Managers are a joke! These are the least professional people I've ever worked around and after 16 yrs working in loss prevention, dealing with thieves, frauds, scammers, and just flat out dishonest people that's really saying something. This store's management team is made up of several unprofessional individuals, both men and women whom only communicate using sarcasm and insults. They treat every new employee as if they're a freshman coming into a  high school dominated by bullies and cowards. They group together in cliques often pointing and laughing at anyone who they choose not to like, and use tactics such as mocking or just flat out ignoring any and all new associates until they quit or conform to the bullies whims. Be prepared to dread every single day of work unless you segregate yourself and join one of the social groups. They divide up by race, not unlike prisoners jail house gangs, and often steal from the lockers in the break room. If you don't lock your personal things in your trunk management will go through them and take what they want. These statements are true as I'm still employed at this location and have filed grievances with corporate office."
bad,No real breakes in a work day. With some workdays over 12 hours.Could be very hostal at times. No real benifites. Benifites only for full time positions. Inconsistant work hours.
bad,I worked for this company for 7 years and it goes to show it is not what you know but who you know and the easiest way to get promoted is to date a manager. Would not send my worst enemy to work there.
bad,Take care of customers needs in a fast and effective manner. We had a lot of high school students as baggers and it was good to assist them as they learned the job and duties.
bad,Publix in my opinion is a great company but the management over there is really corrupt. When it comes to promotions and pay raise the company discriminates their employees on the basis of race. White people will get raises more often in our store than other races. Store manager is corrupt he just cares about raising his bonuses by cutting on his employee pays. Whoever planning to make publix their career I will advice them to stay out of this company for good cuz I have seen a lot during my past 10 years with publix.
bad,greed has taken over Publix as they continue to take benefits away from the employess as well as service that Publix was initially built on Leadership has simply forgot what has taken them to the top Todd Jones is ruining the culture within the company
bad,"Publix is a joke! Great benefits but the people ""Management"" is poorly trained and very unprofessional! Unprofessional is an understatement for the lack of awareness and knowledge when it comes to sensitive information and HR matters. The management's lack of managing makes it a very high stress environment. "
bad,"I currently work at Publix in the bakery. I can truly say I DO NOT feel like they care about me at all. I barely get any hours and when I asked my manager about it I was told to “do better.” No resolution about how I could get more hours. I felt completely disrespected. I am often left to figure out task on my own, I get no help then there is a lot of production, and I’m expected to stay late if things don’t get done"
bad,"The people in the company are not motivators or team players. And the employees are ran over, no respect from management. The hours are difficult to control life/work balance. The atmosphere is great at times depending on the day."
bad,I worked in the deli. Had to slice meat and keep a very clean work area. The management was pretty fair. The workplace culture was okay. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the chicken. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with friendly customers.
bad,"I was employed by Publix for a year. I worked my butt off yet, my pay did not reflect it. The managers show extreme favoritism, you have to be a a** kisser to advance. Management is unprofessional and rude."
bad,"I quit because I had a manager wait outside the bathroom door and when I came out he suspected me of slacking and even when I told him I used the toilet, he went as far as too INSPECT the bathroom to see if it was used."
bad,"Management is bias and have cliques. Does things out of spite, gives raises to “likes”. Customer Service Management is the worst I’ve ever seen. Most of not all of us are tired of it and I guess afraid to address the way they treat other people. They treat some people like outcasts and intentionally do things to prevent them from getting a raise even if they  deserve one or a promotion. Going above and beyond is not recognized or appreciated. Worst job I have ever had. But I’ll smile my way through until I’m done."
bad,The best thing is that I learned how to decorate. That's it. Management could use a switch up and the managers are dropping like flies. When you start so do the health problems. Give it time.
bad,If your not in with management your nothing to them. I literally heard from management talking bad about employees. When or if you call out they make you feel like your killing them. My manager didn’t even sign my card when my daughter passed away!
bad,Maybe Publix used to be a great company to work for but not since the founder died. They made a lot of pretty promises but were all empty. No employee appreciation at all. I wouldn't recommend them
bad,Publix was a great place to work at but its just part time. It's certainly not something I see as permanent. Hardest part of the job is keeping up with the very mixed schedules. What I learned is to most definitely watch your own back and look out for your own. Its a great place to work but favoritism is always happening.
bad,"Always ask for full-time and I never got it. Customer appreciate my job but never appreciate by a Cuban manager he always appreciate only to his people. Customer service manager scream at me and shot up, in front of 4 customers, later she did the same to a customer and she was downgrade to a cashier. Horrible treatment to employers."
bad,"If you want to have a career at publix, then you might as well get prepared to not have a life outside work.  If you are looking for part time work then this may be suitable for you."
bad,there just simply wasn't enough to do to occupy myself for the whole shift so i would get in trouble for trying to entertain myself. management lied to me about what the position i got would be like (said i would have help at night when i was completely alone) department managers were lazy and more than once left me unsupervised for my entire shift during my training period.
bad,"Managers and supervisors abuse you. Count that if you start working at 5 am , at the end of shift at 3 30 pm they want overload with more work, they DO NOT HAVE CONSIDERATION to your persona at all. They just care about being in the office sitting all day long and at the end of the shift give you more obligations. How its that possible that you already have to deal with zero and under 20 degrees of cold and on top of that more and more and more duties at the last minute when your bones are chilled, your feet sore, your hands numbs, red nose of so much running and blowing water, your knees are weak. For sure they only care about being pretty , get the dividends , the bonus , and anything else beyond that is bullcrap .If you are not in their circle they see you as nothing , so please do not apply or shuffle for any position at this place. You will regret it your whole life."
bad,It was awful working there. The bullying and threatening of loosing your job was constant with our managers so they were always stressed out. You were definitely discrimated against in most locations of Publix within Panama City.
bad,"This is my first job an it was good for about a week. Favoritism is huge and when you get on the other end of the spectrum, get ready for bad experience. You’ll be cleaning, get about 13hrs every month, get attitudes from managers, and realize the hard work you put into it nobody looks at."
bad,"Things aren't so pretty once you start working behind the scenes. Outdated computer systems and scales. Old tech everywhere. They used to be on the forefront of technology, but they seem to just not care anymore. Also, they are incredibly wasteful. Very, very little food is donated. "
bad,"Management is mediocre at best, the scheduling is horrible, they find any reason to cut your hours. Pay is below average. Overall not happy with this company at all"
bad,"The company needs to make alot of changes within the company, they let husband and wife work together and other family members.they do not discipline there employee's."
bad,The nonsense that goes on is worse than high school. Management uses favoritism and everyone else suffers. Moving up to full-time from part-time is a joke. All managers talk and if you do something even one doesnt like you are black listed.
bad,"I poured blood, sweat, and tears into this company for 7 years, and was doing well at first. I got full-time, I had insurance, and other benefits. And then one day, we got a new (absolutely horrible) manager, and I was forced to drop to part-time. I lost all my benefits, and I struggled to get enough hours to help pay the bills. Eventually, we were able to afford for me to retire, so that I could finish school. And so that's what I did. I've never been happier, than to be out of that place."
bad,"Full time is given to favorites only, management is very lazy and don't value the employees. Store manager is awful, wouldn't even respect you enough to greet you unless he needed something or there was a district visit."
bad,Company treats their employees as mindless automoton and lesser than human a being with a blatant disregard of their basic human values hidden by a false front culture and promise of great benefits of grandeur that never materializes.
bad,"Unprofessional company!  Advancement  through favoritism not through having managerial materials or experiences!!  Therefore most these are so called managers afraid to lead or do not know how to lead; which leave the leading task to LAZY ones: Lazy ones do about 30% of the work, 30% of us will do 60% of work until very late into the day—-10% of undone tasks will be reflexed on each day reports and later evaluations!"
bad,"This company is all about profits and sales. Nobody cares about ""associates."" Everything is being taken away from the employees. No more retail bonuses, no more opportunities to advance."
bad,Working in the pharmacy was great! but any other department the managers and district managers are awful.  Not enough work life balance. District managers expect too much for way too little. The pay rate will not go up!
bad,"I'm used to the old saying works smarter not harder, but Publix see's it the opposite way. Everything that is done at publix is made harder by the extra steps that are added that do not need to be there. Publix is also the only place I've worked that follows it's own rules depending on what store you work at. Each store has different rules that they choose to follow at the managers discretion."
bad,Im looking for a fulltime job with benefits im parttime and its gonna take me a year to get benefits or have to work 1500 hrs which ever comes first. But im only working like 20hrs a week.
bad,"Publix is a great company to patron, however working their is another story. If they could learn to treat their employees like they treat their customers then everything would be great. This company doesn't pay enough to live in our economy and they over work you while looking over your shoulder like a drill sergeant. This is a very stressful company to work for because it a production for the customer and as they say when the doors open your on stage, which is crazy when real life things happen life family emergencies."
bad,"Spent most of my time cleaning the equipment before closing.  Lead to long hours and ample stress.  The times I interacted with and served customers were nice, but most of the time was spent just scrubbing things."
bad,A typical day in the bakery is constant on the go with always something to be done. It is the perfect job for someone who is a busy body and likes to be productive.
bad,"It was okay job to work at first but not too good of a company what I thought since people talk SO good about it. Made sure you didn’t get OT, scheduled a work day during the hurricane That was going on in Fl which was dangerous and just didn’t like it. Not a job for young ones. For the felons they hire older MEN"
bad,"We work from 13-14 hours per day (only getting paid for 12 hours) in order to complete the numerous tasks presented to us. No matter how hard you work, it is unappreciated."
bad,"The management at Publix is not the proper environment for anyone to succeed underneath unless they are accustomed to pressure. There are rarely any chances to advance, despite the years of experience many associates have when applying. You are not able to change positions and in order to raise your wage, you have to exceed perfectionist expectations that are nearly impossible to do unless the employee is a robot."
bad,"My time at publix was not pleasant. They schedule you inconsistently every week. I often had to beg just to get 20 hours per week. After four and a half years with the company, I still did not make 2 dollars more per hour then when i started."
bad,"I've been working here for three years and we have been through 6 managers and assistant managers. I have never once been late to work and I do my work very well yet my managers still won't promote me. I have great customer service skills and I am cross trained. The managers treat the workers like we are less than them. They are always hiring new people which cuts off everyone's hours. However, the company does have very good benefits and pay raises."
bad,"stressful hard and no consistency Advice to Management"
bad,I worked with Publix for 8 months in the deli. There is never enough workers no one wants to stay there. The pay isn't worth the amount of work that is expected out of you . It is an act of Congress to get full time even after it is offered to you
bad,Its good pay but if you want to be under somebody radar all the time its not a place for you to work at you have to put money out your pocket ti work their they are very picky about their dresscode and will get on to you about shoes when somebody else shoes dont fit the dress code they will pick at you talk about you and hard to understand the time off. Very stressful for a teen and im part time
bad,working at ip global as a clearwire sales person was difficult. it amounted to what could be considered to a door to door sales man but without the support or the training really required to do so. showing the product was  difficult because every time I would use the product it would require 30 mins to work and a call to the offices to troubleshoot the product. it also seemed to be sabotaged by clearwire themselves with an opening of their own store  in the area.
bad,"Terrible management, terrible delegation. This could be a great job but none of the management cares about you. They play favorites all day long. I work really hard and I get zero notification. I get used and abused because they know that know matter what I am there to do my job. The only part I truly enjoy is the customers, most customers are very nice and are fun to talk to and get to know."
bad,"Management very disrespectful to employees. They claim customer service is #1, but if you are helping a customer and go over by a minute with overtime, you will get written up. Typical day at work is being belittled by management. If you want to advance in the company it is very politically driven. Management team takes no blame. It always seems to be the associates fault, even if told by management to take action that you are blamed for. No teamwork,a lot of back stabbing. Was told once by management, ""Part timers tell us what to do, and we tell Full timers what to do"""
bad,for the amount of work they give you the pay is terrible and unappreciated as the management team is very rude and mean to everyone in that department
bad,"A typical day at work was like most jobs, busy and you are always moving."
bad,"You will get fired for sneezing.You have no life and work ALL THE TIME,you will wish that you were dead."
bad,"The company is great as far the employees and the customers. The management team suck. Even the people at corporate. My day to day duties were taking care of customers needs. As far as sending and receiving money for transfers, money orders , lottery and ticketmaster. Scanning and bagging groceries."
bad,It's hard to make enough income if you just work for Publix alone. I would  recommend getting a second job. Otherwise everything else is great about this company.
bad,"Every year, the Company makes OVER $1.2 Billion in PROFIT (Meaning, ALL bills are paid in full.) But yet, hourly rate is not that great and the quarterly dividends on the stock, is less than 1%. Please, go find a better job or career than this. I am, and will only be here for the next two or maybe three months."
bad,"The 1462 store is the most worst and difficult store to work in the managers are very rascist they do colorism and I my self was a victim I will never let anyone of my enticement work fir this company. U can be calling them to ask questions and yes they will hang up on it  faces I swear on my life worst experience ever even till these days I still have my last pay check under their mouths"
bad,"Everyone brags on how great this company is! What a joke, management threatens to hurt you and will punish you by cutting your hours if you tell anyone else. They will also write u up for stuff that isn’t true! You have great co-workers and the customers are wonderful and actually care about you. Management however is horrible and they only care about bonuses. They like to hire people with disabilities but treat them horrible. Just don’t do it, stay away."
bad,"At my particular store, the management was horrible.  The job was very demanding without any praise.  Raises are not guaranteed, and the raises are low.  The pay scale is not fair, and they do not pay based on experience.  Someone new can make more than someone that has been with the company for years."
bad,Store management doesn’t care about its employees at 829. Needed time off because my mom is dying. My store manager was very nasty to me.sad to say...
bad,"Very disappointed. I was told during my interview I would be a cashier. That I would get my hours as this store was about to reopen. I start working here and I'm forced to bag,  fetch carts 4 times a shift, and clean bathrooms, trash, and floors. They lied about your role of being strictly a cashier. You hired baggers. So, why am I bagging? If you refuse to do what the customer service employees want you to do,  it gives them more reason to put in a word to the manager to cut your hours and force you to leave."
bad,The management is terrible and people are just rude and stuck up. If there is a problem you can’t solve it because no one is willing to talk. So everyone keeps being rude and disrespectful.
bad,Publix usef to be the place to work now its no better than bilo or some other chain the management stinks no rules are followed and u literally work urself to death its not worth the pay to be away from ur family that much
bad,"I worked there for 6 months never received any decent training, management greatly sucked put me in a position I had never dealt with and just threw me in never had any training got reprimanded daily, I worked my tail off and to see other people lollygag around was upsetting but in the end they got to keep their job... Dont work here its not whay its cracked up to be."
bad,"Every Manager in the company plays Favorites and delegates hours to the people the like versus the people that actually work. promotions are solely based on manager discretion and if you manager like you, you will go nowhere. the pay is abysmal and the raises are $0.25 every six months."
bad,headache ok company to work for not fair don't treat employees fair always have to walk round like u on pins and needles only good thing pay and the free lunch
bad,"If you are willing to spend 15 years in the same position in order to be considered for a promotion, this is the place for you. If you expect your leadership to have technical and interpersonal skills as well as emotional intelligence....run the other way."
bad,"I worked in the deli. Always undermanned, been blown off by managers when asking for help, expected 100% effort at all times even though you get minimum returns for your effort. My co-worker, who was only trying to get an assistant manager position, was promised that at her rate she would soon get it, only to be told each evaluation period over and over again it was delayed, each time due to small, human mistakes(not even I saw what she was doing wrong most of the time). I also worked quite hard, out of principle. Because I was told if I did, I would be rewarded. I worked there for four and a half years with no realistic improvements for the benefits I received."
bad,"Great company to work for if you're willing to spend years trying to get management, But if you are someone wanting to make life move at a quick paste I would not recommend Publix."
bad,"I didn't really have a good experience working at Publix. First of all, the management system there were not well organized, they had a favoritism mentality, plus they put most of the work loead on 1 person."
bad,Publix used to be a people minded company that made their employees feel valuable. It has turned into a corporate monster that is only concerned with profit. Employees are only numbers and the work environment has become intimidating. Don't plan on getting promoted unless you want to sacrifice all time with your family. Salaried managers are taken full advantage of. Upper management has turned to job threatening and brow beating as apposed to the coaching and mentoring of the past. Pay and benefits are great but how much is your soul worth?
bad,"Publix started out at as a good place to work.  Then they hired many extra employees and hours were reduced to 3 to 6 per week.  Can not live on that amount.  Discussed this with management to no avail.  I enjoyed working with the employees and the management, but they were not concerned about personal issues and reasons for need of hours.  Was employed for almost two years with this company and the hours are not getting better, they are only getting worse.  This is a perfect job for a high school student or a person who is only looking for a couple hours a week to keep themselves busy.  Not for someone who is looking to make this their soul income."
bad,"you really picture a nice work environment the store is always nice, but behind the nice décor and great product are monsters for employees their very impatient and they're really not cooperative."
bad,"when my position changed they dropped my wage more than a dollar . an employee had to work certain amt of hours  to receive benefits . many employees didn't get the hours they were promised  including myself ,  they would continue to hire new people. this interfered with hours to obtain benefits.If you are interested in management they will push people through this program , which is also stressful. I worked for them 2 years that was all I could take."
bad,get a raise only if u good in with management not by your performance
bad,Worked in the deli department. Enjoyed the customer interactions and getting to help them get what they asked for
bad,"The renowned corporation known as Publix starts off the greatest place in the world to work. They've got great benefits, ranging from tuition reimbursement (for those who want a degree in business), employee stock ownership, and a nice 401 K, but the deeper with the company you get, the worse your experience gets. Eventually, you find yourself getting caught in a struggle between employees and their employers who promote employees based on friendships with them and demote, or prevent those who possess quality skills from rising up further within the company. I would not recommend anyone working with this cutthroat corporation."
bad,In terms of working in retail Publix is the best of the worst. They work you like dogs and lie often about anything and everything especially opportunities and advancement.
bad,"Decent job for a student (because of the tuition reimbursement program) or retiree- not that great overall. Management as a whole seemed rather disconnected and lazy. Additionally, favoritism was a consistent problem."
bad,I was with them for quite a while and you never know what your going to do when you get to work because things are always changing so if your looking for a challenge you will never get board.
bad,"It's surprisingly that some review said about company don't schedule out of employee availability. It's so untrue. Store manager and manager forcing me to leave because I requested the schedule with my avaibility.  Got sick , called out, they upset and write you up for being sick and absent. Shows up at work, sick, they sent you home"
bad,"One week you will get 30 hours but the next few weeks 10-18 hours. You will be scheduled to come in for a 4 hour shift and get a 45 minute break. They want you to have open availability but will schedule you until 11 pm then have you there at 4am to move displays after they clean the floors. You will do it all scrub toilets, cashier, push carts in the rain, clean floors, stock, beg for money for charities,"
bad,Poor management and one sided management I don't recommend to work for publix and I said before really bad management and by the way don't get into trouble
bad,This company has changed and the culture is horrible!! They have poor management and they only care about a dollar! I wouldn't reccomend anyone work for publix.
bad,"I will start off by saying don’t waste your time here. The only positives about working here is the benefits, but they fool you when you first start working there by acting like it’s such a great work environment when it’s really not. You would think that you would get a discount for working here but you don’t because you get stock in the company but it takes a year and you bad have to work full time to get them. The management is horrible, the coworkers are annoying and rude at times. And the customers are sometimes the worst people"
bad,"If you do your job and exceed expectations, you LITERALLY can do everyone else’s job. Working in the Deli is not at all a good place. Customer Service is secondary. Publix would rather “Fix” an issue than prevent it in the first place. "
bad,has a pattern of suppressing the strong & enabling the week. kiss ups & snakes get promoted. management & corporate suck. it’s a good first job though.
bad,"Management is inconsistent. It’s more like Highschool than a business.  If you’re not part of the “in crowd’ then you’re treated as such. Gossip, backstabbing and threats are daily."
bad,If customer service and retail is what you enjoy than this is the job for you but if not try somewhere else. This is a good starting place but not a lifelong career.
bad,"Too stressful they don’t care if you burned yourself or cut yourself. Associates are not helping you at all. They expect you to know all stuff in the deli right away. I’ve been scheduled to be trained for a week but on the first day at the deli they only spent 3 hours of teaching me all stuff including the slicer and after that you do all of it right away. When you ask questions since literally you don’t know a thing yet ,because you are just new,other associates will be angry at you. I heard them backstabbing about the other newbie working there for few weeks that still didn’t know how to do the job. When I asked for help on where is the BH low sodium swiss cheese one associate got mad at me.When I clocked out they started talking about me and the other new hire too which is not nice. Learned my lesson won’t wanna work on the same area again.I know i’m different since im still new but I didn’t know i will be treated differently in that store too. So sad but I don’t wanna risk my mental state just workin there."
bad,Left after 20+ years. Company has gone downhill over the years. Company is not associate or customer focused anymore. They are exclusively about making money. Money is great as a manager. Not so much as an hourly associate.
bad,When there is a well developed team that works together well this job is wonderful and extremely rewarding but it can also be extremely draining when the team fails.
bad,"Just a lot of double standards. Work here if you want to be a yes man. Great benefits, but the day to day grind after 8 years with micro managers who have never worked retail or are so far out of touch is just not worth it."
bad,Management can be very spotty if you're looking for full time good luck with that. They survive on part time employees the only full-time is department managers
bad,"a typical day at bakery in Publix you get there and clean after everyone from the decorate side and your the only one there having to deal with some mean and snobby customers sometimes, and they all come at once"
bad,"only thing that made my time they're acceptable was my coworkers. management was poor and lazy, some were good but for the most part most were lazy and let the clerks do everything and then complain."
bad,Coming into work and being told what to do off the bat and having rude managers. Other coworkers would judge you for different things that has happened in the past. Was never able to move up in
bad,this company is going in the wrong direction. Its not family first anymore and business driven and the people that have been there for years are the ones that aren't happy.
bad,"Inexperienced management, poor work/life balance, departmental incompetence, negligence, and demeaning, unrealistic expectations set by Grocery department management."
bad,"Management is the worst part of this job. They will 'correct' you in front of customers and they are hardly ever present when you need them. They will belittle you and they honestly don't care about you if you arn't planning on being at Publix your whole life. The actual job is not that hard. Working in the deli was neither positive nor negative. After the basic training of working the deli slicer and cleaning, I trained MYSELF on all other stations: Making subs, frying chicken, register, cold selection, stocking, out of dates scanning, and specialty cheeses. I trained myself because when I asked, they told me not to worry about it. But some days we were understaffed and I did have to worry about it. The only good part about this job is I made lifelong friends there."
bad,I asked for specific hours and they would schedule me 2 hours before i could come in after i told them many times i couldn't come in. And the people in my department just talk bad about each other and fight all the time and I am always pulled into it.
bad,"Publix is known for their customer service, and it is their number 1 priority-for customers. They offer great benefits and retirement, however they do not offer a good work-life balance. Their internal HR department is difficult to deal with and makes it apparent that they are not there to help the associates, only to protect the company."
bad,i feel like publix is a good job to work for great benefits they are flexible with your schedule and very understanding
bad,If  CEO Todd jones was paid hourly & worked 40 hrs a week he would be paid $1200+ AN HOUR. Yet employees get a review every 6 months only to maybe get a50cent raise. Cant possibly keep up with workload. Dm will come into our store & see we are elbow to elbow with customers bc it is so busy yet still complain literally over labels not all facing out perfectly on a display he just saw people purchasing from. Impossible to stay motivated
bad,"Out of 13 years dedicate to Publix .Has seen Publix declined with management. Publix is still very lucky to have most wonderful associates. Everywhere I transferred ,meet good co-workers , and stay in touch with them just like forever . But meet more dishonest managers and store managers . Won't look back or return to Publix."
bad,Never work with Publix u going to waist your Time and your age hours not  guarantee  Full time forgot about it u have to give something to your manager store u know what I mean some mangers  races as part time u going to get 3 days work 15 hrs a week
bad,"Management's biggest problem is favoritism from the moment they hire someone that lives in their family to the moment they put someone who has worked there longer than you but, is 10x lazier than you above you in terms of who has to make up for the work they dont want to do. The store overall is meh. Along with the job. But its never good when your managment is causing people to severly dread their own job."
bad,They gave little to no hours. They work well with your schedule but will only give you 3-6 hours a day if you ask to only work certain days and you will only work a couple of those days. There were multiple weeks I only had 3 hours and my schedule was wide open
bad,"Good place , free lunch, good benefits, unprofessional environment, cero confidentiality, learning opportunity, free lunch, not growing opportunity..."
bad,"Managers refuse to give raises and advancements to deserving employees, people are either always slacking or are grilling you. Terrible hours, and they’ll mess with your pay, too."
bad,If you have plans outside of Publix as in school or anything this job isn’t for you they cut hours frequently  and very unstable if your not full time and it’s not easy to get full time
bad,"They got real high expectations, for them not to give you a nickel or a quarter raise."
bad,"I worked at Publix for 3 yrs. For the most part I loved my job and made so many friends. I consider some of there people MY FAMILY!"
bad,Publix is an excellent place to work it was just not for me.  I enjoyed my coworkers and the work at Publix the only thing is that you never know how many hours a week you will get to work.  During the summer it is a slow season it is unpredictable how much you will get to work
bad,"Over the past two years I have enjoyed working with Publix. But it came time to move on. I need a change of environment. I worked in the deli, at first we had alot of help and one by one people either left the job or transfered. Probably due to management. After awhile we finally got more help, but the new people were not a good fit for the job description because the were not willing to learn."
bad,"Managements was not good at all , It’s all about favoritism for you to get hours I was being bullied by a team leader her name start with a ST Call corporate and didn’t do nothing about it so I quit. To work there you really have to tell on each other to get a raise you have to be a snitch."
bad,"It’s a secure job for most employees. The company works you to the bone with minimum pay, hours and absolutely no benefits unless your full time. It’s not for everyone"
bad,Before working for Publix I really thought a lot about it and really wanted to be apart of it once I worked here i liked the job and the management and my co workers but before I left I saw their true colors the favoritism is honestly just plain sad I watched as myself and a hole team of associates were treated like scum to take and promote two brothers one being the others manager I can say that in my 10 plus years in the work force that this company was the only one that took advantage of my hard work and dedication
bad,"the workplace culture is different at other stores, and you learn different ways to perform your job at the workplace. A typical work flow comes in waves differs because of location."
bad,Managers are flexible the availability is flexible I have been with this company for 11 years and they also have good benefits. Getting full time is very hard but I am a part timer
bad,Publix is a good workpalce that’s my first job 8 years I’m just looking for a better job and try something new   I need hours and I want to try something  new.
bad,I loved working at Publix in the beginning. But as time went on new managers came in and new rules were put in place. I started to dread coming to work. Always felt like I was walking on eggshells. Never knew what was going to change that day. I would never go back.
bad,this can be a great company to work for if you can make past the fake love all the things you here in orientation do not mean anything unless you are willing to be a good slave that will go for anything
bad,This may have been the most unenjoyable job I have ever worked for. They needed organization and management skills. When your shop for people you should only think of the best service to give.
bad,"The only positive thing i have to say about this company are the benefits. After 3 years of dedicated service, 2 role model evaluations, and praise from my managers i resigned with not only disappointment, but also determination to set out to find a job that promotes based on hard work, which this company does not. This company is a swamp, only promoting within mostly based on friendships with other managers, or butt-kissing suck ups. Many will read this and make the assumption i am being unfair or biased, but as i said, after consecutive high performing evaluations and first hand knowledge of the scandals within, i refused to be a part of such an exaggerated excuse for a friendly company. It is all fake, we are forced to be ""kind and friendly"" and constantly threatened if we aren't. It's all a facade."
bad,"Pay and benefits were okay, I suppose. But the job itself (in the deli anyway) was absolutely terrible. No help. Never got off in time, Wasn't progressing there."
bad,You tend to get emotionally attached to your customers and because of that reason is why i strived so hard at work to keep my Customers extremely satisfied!
bad,Very low pay. Management is not bad but they should be more understandable. Not a lot of hollidays off. Not a stressful job. Not opportunities to advance.
bad,"I am very indifferent towards this job. The pay and benifits were wonderful. Half the management was wonderful, however; the other half was very biased, incompetent, and highly unprofessional. Also their scheduling methods were below normal standards."
bad,If your not apart of the good ole boys club you dont have a chance. You have to follow publix policy and what ever rules your current front line supervisor rules as well.
bad,"The only bright side about this company is that you cannot get fired. I consider myself a respectable individual and therefore took quite a bit of pride in my work despite how menial it may have been. However, you constantly and only work with those who want to get paid for doing as little as possible. They constantly get away with this and management will never do anything about this. You literally cannot get fired so long as you play dumb and tell them you're trying. So, for those of you who want a system to cheat be my guest. Those of you who take pride in yourselves, don't even come within a mile of one of these."
bad,Management was awful. People were terrible. Hours sucked. Won't go back. The pay was ok and the benefits were good. Don't care about you.
bad,Publix cares more about your outward appearance than the customer service itself. Theyjudge you on your own perceptions and tell you from the jump that they have no life but Publix and you better get on board. Management is clueless and could care less about employees. This company plays favorites more than any company I have been with.
bad,"I'm currently employed with Publix Supermarket. My store managers are incompetent and extremely impersonal, whereas they advertise to their future employees that they have an ""open-door"" policy and that they're oh-so-friendly. The distribution of work is practically non-existent-- Those on the front-end that aren't behind the customer service desk do ALL the labor, whilst those behind the customer service desk give commands, text on their phones, and sit back and make jokes. The hardest part of this job, however, is the extremely variable schedule. From one week to the next I could go from an excess of 28 hours on two 10 hour shifts and an 8 hour shift (Yes, ALWAYS long shifts!), to having as little as 5 hours the next week! There is no guarantee that you'll EVER be able to experience the benefits that you're told you'll receive-- because the benefits require a certain amount of hours monthly, and the computer they use to assign schedules doesn't allow for a minimum-- many people come up short hours and have their healthcare CUT in times of great need!"
bad,"Management at Publix do not keep their promises.  If your direct Supervisor does not like you, he/she takes it out on your schedule (not giving you hours)."
bad,"Bad place to work if you care about your work ethic you are just a number "
bad,"Publix es una de las peores lugares para oportunidades , te usan como un trapo y depues te tiran, te ofrecen 32 horas y a lo ultimo teminas con 15 horas de trabajo ala semana . Yo en lo personal trabaje por 4 anos,y los managers se creen que te pieden posotear como,te hablan grocero ,te hacen sentir mal y si te enfermas es peor te tratan como lo peor lo recomiendo"
bad,Management at the store at OIB was terrible.managers were against each other. My manager had her favorites..mostly the younger employees that weren't a threat to her job. Doing my best was never acknowledged..I am sure that all Publix stores would not be the same..but I no longer want to even shop there.
bad,"The management is horrible they are rude and I didn’t get enough hours I was basically poor working at Publix  the co workers were okay , but I still didn’t like them. I only got 5/6 hours a week they suck. And nobody there cares about your well being they show way to much favoritism"
bad,"Horrible hours, no full time available ever. Pay is average, if you are looking for a part time job, working flexible hours Publix could work for you, Publix is way behind as far as the grocery business is concerned, managment and office personel believe they are above everyone else, like some kind of God's., Don't work there unless it's no other option."
bad,I loved working for publix I loved the environment and the love and support from happy customers.. it had many lows but i made it on simply by creating a clean workplace
bad,"My specific work experience was not enjoyable at all. I worked hard and was not appreciated. I wanted to advance but did not after a year working there. Some people hired after me immediately got hired into higher positions. I got in trouble for trying to see where the inventory was so I could more easily help customers, and it was a slow day and I knew I didn’t have any tasks, yet my manager yelled at me for being inconsistent."
bad,Leadership and work skills are good in a work place. Being constant and dedication. I believe working hard and asking questions learning all positions will make master ur job and skills.
bad,"The actual employees were easy to get along with, just wish i could say the same about the management there. They would listen to complaints that people made but they would never go the extra mile to actually fix the complaint."
bad,the managment was terrible always punishing anyone who would have an emergency at home or if they were sick by giving less hours the following week...
bad,"Way too boring and not worth it, the people there weren't the best, the job wasn't the best, hated the thought of having to go to work every time I was scheduled."
bad,"Supposedly friendly respect team work is was ALLWAYS about the other competition not about them work or respect ..... They even lie in your face even bringing truth unfortunately bcuz of the case......"
bad,I hated working here treated you like you are in high school. not a good job to have as a mother with small children at home. will never work here again
bad,"It use to be a great company. Past tense. Management is too weak to run stores. Customers are unnecessarily rude. The company is too concerned about opening more stores, when current opened stores are hurting, drowning, or flat out floundering. Publix is no longer carrying out their Mission."
bad,"Always treated respectfully and fairly. Good 401K plan, medical plan and stock purchase ability Company always rated as the top 100 companies for work for."
bad,My experience at Publix it is very stressful you work like a slave The Motto work you do is not worth it for the pay the management have no respect for the associates it's all about the customers and even when the customer is disrespect you and think it's okay the only thing that's good about Publix is the stock in the for 41K but after that everything is terrible part-timers get one something all week that's not enough to pay a rent bill I wouldn't recommend anyone that has responsibility to work for Publix but if you are student in high school with no responsibilities just to pay a phone bill you can work for now
bad,"We have some of the worst 'leaders' in management. Managers get promoted based on their willingness to surrender their life to Publix, not on ability."
bad,Arrive at Bakery check products on floor if i need to fill floor i do..Remove out of date product ..sanitize all my cases.and cleaned from any debris..i enjoy dealing with customers very rewarding
bad,"Little to no consideration for employees or their families , scammed out of insurance and all benefits as a 60+hour a week ""part time"" employee. hands down worst company I have ever worked for."
bad,"I help lead and develop my coworkers in the grocery department. I maintain inventory control and ensure high selling items are in stock. Customer service is the most important part of my job. My job also consists of heavy lifting, off loading and loading trailers, and operation of a fork lift."
bad,this company sucks they dont care about the workers customer is always right i hate publix. nobody is full time and you have to be full time to get the good benefits everyone is talking about
bad,"Did not enjoy working here. Was hired as a cashier, but was told to do other jobs I did not apply for. Did not enjoy working here."
bad,"Very difficult to trust management staff,  they will stab you in the back and throw you under the bus to make themselves look good or to save their butts"
bad,"Fun place to work & best envirement ever, nice people to work in there & also motivation is the key to succes & happyness. I use to feel like family plus my team was always there for me. I use to be employee of the months at list 20 times as well."
bad,A typical day at work at Publix first I walk the store greet all my co-workers Identified any opportunities we can take care of. Check my daily bakery items that we  will need threw  out the day aAt the end of the day we clean my area also organized all merchandise for the next shift
bad,"Publix is a great place to work. The staff is very welcoming, and what I loved the most is that you could move up in the company fast."
bad,It's the worst place I've ever worked. Associates are not respected and the image Publix tries to convey to the world is totally false. The thing I learned from working at Publix is to never work at Publix.
bad,"Publix is a great place to work, the people there are super friendly."
bad,This job allows you top move up quickly and has a flexible schedule which is great for students. All of my associates we friendly and the work environment was very upbeat and positive.
bad,What I usually do at work I help cook in the back as well as help costumers in the front. lifting heavy stuff torts the end of the night is the most challenging thing for me.
bad,"i spent a a little over a year with this company. the company sells you a bunch of lies about how they care about their worker but you wont get any of that sympathy from management. they're tough as nails to work for but if you're tough, you'll make it."
bad,"Greeting all customers, serving all meats and cheeses upon request. Preparing and making submarine sandwiches. Keeping all condiment areas cleaned and filled. Sanitizing and cleaning all equipment and floors in the entire deli department. The most enjoyable part of the job would be customers satisfaction and smiles."
bad,"On a regular day of work as a sanitation associate, was to keep the warehouse clean to make it a safe working environment, The great part was that you were independently working at your own pace."
bad,Opening cash register counting money putting money in draw turn light ready to serve customers go to end of register and welcome customers in you line ring cusomers orders up tender payment bag grocries assist customers with there needs excellent customer service brings in more people my co workers all work together so we can accoplishment the mission together and make the business growhaving fellow employess calling off all the time and not enough helpthe most ejoyable part of the job is talking to the cutomers and getting to know them
bad,Worked there for 6 months worked 12 hrs on sat or more and worked 9 hr days during the week had a hour lunch and no breaks the girls I worked in the bakery where  mean and stuck up and I have done cakes for 13 years at that time of employment and they made me feel like I didn't know what I was doing didn't think I would ever work agin as a cake decorator but working for foodlion now
bad,"Publix is a good company, but work conditions and management are not always as good as they should be.  Breaks are not given timely and employee well being is sometimes overlooked."
bad,"Barely make 12 hours a week . Great for part time work but not full time, does not hit full time “full time is earned” over a time period. Some of the managers are horrible"
bad,"Shopping here may be a pleasure but working certainly wasn't for me. Everyone's dying for a promotion to the point where they talk down to people on the same level as them in order to ""sound smarter"" to management. Forced to smile when absolutely no one is around. If you're thinking about working here you need to develop a big, fake, Broadway smile that can be seen miles away because your normal smile still won't be enough. Management watches and critiques you. And I guarantee if you watch anyone long enough (including them) you'll see them mess up because guess what: we're all imperfect! Sucks that the store is like that because it could be a very nice place to work; good hours, good pay, benefits, customers can be okay depending where you work, easy work."
bad,Supervisors are in charge of too many technicians and are unable to correctly decipher all the information needed to proper supervise. The website that instructs the technicians on resolving issues lacks instructions and not enough staff to update it so the technician is hindered. If there is an issue too many people gets involved so it makes the issue worse. Needs much more organization.
bad,"-a typical day at work for me is providing excellent customer service and maintaining all normal daily task."
bad,enjoy my time here ii am hoping that I learn a lot in this company an that I am able to move forward in the company if time allows it is such a great pleasure to feel welcomed here an meet nice people
bad,Hard work 10 hours a day. I have learnt a lot of people skills. Most enjoyable part of the job is teaching people and talking to customers. I love to see us busy all day. Co-workers are fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is when business is slow and when I do not get the support I need to be effective.
bad,"they treat their emplooyees with respect and train with patience, clean, coodinated feed their employees and open , I am honored to be apart of such a well balanced copany"
bad,allways have a good actitud and be friendly with every body . 
bad,Serve customers
bad,"every day was fun "
bad,typical day at work would be to prepare foods deal with nasty atttitudes from management
bad,Publix thinks they are better but they aren't  it's very who you know company they use you until they dont need you but if you need a job to get by it's fine for that
bad,"I honestly do not recommend this job, I know people who still work there and are miserable there because for one reason we all ask for more hours but they always deny us more hours because they already have too many people but will literally hire someone every other week. The work environment was not friendly and a lot of people had grudges against new workers and it was honestly too much for me."
bad,A family-work place to start entry-level work it helps you have a better way of knowing retailing in the industrial company. Not a fair place to work.
bad,"Very disappointing. Only offers full time in some departments or management. So no matter how great of an employee you may be, you will never receive full time. Some of us are in the age bracket that need full time to be able to barely function in our lives, with our bills and gas and mileages we may be driving just to get there. When it comes time for your six month evaluation, no matter all the extra time you've offered to work when others call out , you are penalized for that one incident or mistake. Not feeling the appreciation."
bad,"punch a time clock ,  arrive at assigned registar scan merchandise bag merchandise collect payment take a lunch break if applicable return to assigned registar and continue servicing customers"
bad,You will only work 10 hours a week on their slow season. Cashier should not have vaccume rugs and place them all over the store when you are scheduled to open.
bad,"•	Co-coordinated projects for tasting sessions for potential customers"
bad,"One of the lasting things that I will remember about Publix is the poor management. Not only does this statement address the upper management, but also the team leaders and those working the customer service staff. Many lacked the knowledge and responsibility necessary for their position and most were children."
bad,"My first job at 14. It was great at first, but steadily became worse due to the strange fact that Publix likes to replicate managers for no good reason other than to ""help them succeed"". The Customer Service employees make your life a living h e double bendy straws, as well as management, and the only real good reason to work here is for experience and the cashiers and other bag boys and girls."
bad,"Management walk all over you, took adventage of your availablity, never respected you, cut all holiday pay, bonuses and pay upgrades, just an awful place to work"
bad,Fun place to work if you love your customers. Horrible place to work if you expect to get recognized by management. Management is not interested on helping associates advance. Management lacks in recognizing associates that want to advance. Reliable/ Hard working associates do not get the recognition they deserve.
bad,It was a terrible Experience.  Being hired as full tome and getting 10 or less hours a week. Some times tjey would have me come in for just 2 hrs. Waste of time and gas to at over there.
bad,"This review is for Tennessee only. My management team was awful, lied about hours and terminated good employees based on favoritism."
bad,"Have to treat the customers like kings and queens, even though the customers are wrong thats no excuse their always right"
bad,"worst place ive ever had the displeasure to work at. managment was terrible, the workers were terrible. No one wanted to actually do their jobs. All of the work fell on to a few of us that actually wanted to work and advance. No one recognized anything we did. It was terrible. The very thought of worker there again makes me want to puke."
bad,I've been with publix for over a year now. My department manager plays favoritism with the employees. I for one am not one of her favorites. Only her favorites get decent hours. I am getting between 5- 15 a week. I have NEVER been trained. I had to learn it all on my own. A typical day at work is stressful everyone is rude and obnoxious. My co-workers for the most part are nice and hard working with the exception of the few that are not. The hardest part of my job I would have to say is closing everything. We have the most labor intensive job at Publix. The most enjoyable part of my job is the regular customers that just stop by to say hello and give you a little bit of company.
bad,"Management needs work on allowing newly hired to the on added responsibilities or jobs.  Too much interference and micro management.  They treat everyone as if they are 14-16 years old.  Much of the important , must be correct type work is given to the more senior aged employees to perform instead of speed evenly and fairly amount all workers."
bad,"One week they would give 30 another week give 5 hours with one hour  break"
bad,"Publix was my first job! But I used to be a cashier at first then I transferred to grocery and then to a position. They used me to fill that certain () position for 6 months without the proper training and would not officially put me in the () position to get the proper training by the proper trainer. It was a shame of what happened, they gave me the () uniform and at the 5 month mark they told me to stop wearing the uniform they provided and made me wear the grocery clerk uniform instead of the other uniform. The store manager looked at me and said straight to my face "" I never considered you for the position."" I was there trying to the work with all the effort I had to provide and in the end they were just using me. So they transferred me back to customer service and took me out."
bad,"Regional and district management are total jerks that only care about themselves. Pay use to be good but bonuses cut in half for store management but district, regional and up got big increases"
bad,"This job started for me great. I was excited to work for Publix, and stayed overly excited for 2 of my 5 years working for them, working in many different departments. After a while, I noticed the company over works and under pays managers, and is CONSTANTLY dangaling the carrot when it comes to full time. If you only want part time stressful work, this job is for you. If you want fulltime, managment, a normal career to succeed in, look elsewhere. They lure you in with company stock, saying employees own the company, but they really just own a small percentage, as the rest is tied up with CEOs that overpay themselves, while cutting bonuses and raises for other employees. In my 5 years I made less than 11$ an hour while they hired ithers off the street for over my pay."
bad,"Underpaid, thankless, and mentally and emotionally stressful Two weeks paid vacation days, which were required to be used for medical purposes. Don't approve of this job."
bad,"I was the closer of the Bakery Dept.  The other employees were not doing their assigned jobs, I was called in very early on some days to help package baked products. I moved in March of 2015 to Idaho,"
bad,"Store managers do not like giving employees raises because it hinders their own bonuses. Therefore, when it is time to give a raise to an employee that person gets a bad evaluation, poor scores with no raise, or if that person does get a raise it is the minimum amount you can possibly receive. Work performances are not evaluated correctly. The company's inner politics is what makes Publix not that great to work for, given that I only gave one example."
bad,This was a very good job. Customer service needed was very high. It was a very demanding job. The management was not that great but workable.  The job was a stressful job at times.
bad,"While Publix tells their employees how much they value them, it's all empty words. While there are plenty of long term benefits for full time employees, there are no employee discounts to make up for the low pay of the little guys, and moving up is a slow slog of red tape that's often inconsistent and unfair. I worked there for four years, and despite never being written up, having great attendance, and rarely being late, I was greatly underpaid, and my managers refused to promote me to full time, despite making me work 39.5 hour workweeks. Keeping me just under the amount needed to be full time. Treating full time as a carrot on a stick to make me work harder, but never intending to actually reward me for my efforts. I eventually left frustrated at my manager, deciding I'd be better off started fresh somewhere else."
bad,It is a well known company. It benefits full time employees. Yet it is hard to gain full time. Part time work is great for a double income family or elderly needing to supplement their income.
bad,Very disappointing experience.  Work you to death. No benefits. Overtime required. No training. Just throw you in to the mess. Managers walk away and hide when problems occur.
bad,"Management is not interested in your job title or advancement.  Hired as cashier but had to bag and get carts in parking lot. Have more talent  than grab shopping carts.  Managers hover around employees to see what they say to one another. When you need a manager, could not find one. When business was down, could not get hours to pay bills. Keep hiring people which cuts our hours. Publix wants employees to shut up and work as robots. Was time to move on."
bad,Stressful  with customers always complaining as well as supervisors.    The customer is always right no matter if  they are wrong.  The supervisors didn't want any complaints to the corporate office.
bad,You only advance if you know someone who is in a higher position. The job is very competitive and cutthroat. Favoritism is the main objective. Management is fickle
bad,Good job for personages balancing out college while working takes way too long while working there to get any kind of insurance raises take way too long
bad,I've been employed here for a while it's just alot of funny things go on working here. I've learned it's on a who you Know if u will ever advance. Don't get me WRONG it's a few good mangers in the play SOMEWHERE I just haven't ran into many out of my 10years. That why I go to work and do my work an leave. But if you can deal with a lil MESS here and there and not knowing if you going to get hours to feed your kids THE COMPANY IS ALRIGHT TO WORK FOR IF YOU HAVE A PLAN.
bad,"Overall working at Publix is great when they give me hours. My availability is completely open and I am lucky to get more than 20 hours a week because there are so many employees in my department. I get all of my hours in 2 or three days, for the week. I held off on starting college because they more than likely wouldn't have hired me if I hadn't."
bad,Management needed more training.compensation was not up to par with the tasks that were expected. Time off was very hard to get especially when you have a family.
bad,"You work very long hours especially around holidays, and then due to the stores needing supplies, you will work holiday as well."
bad,"Working at Publix was good at times, but there was alot of favoritism. People who worked hard and had been there for a long time didn't get the recognition that they deserved. The young and pretty girls were getting ahead with little to no work. It was sad. The management was horrible."
bad,"nothing to say about this company. very profitable. based in Lakeland, FL.  have about 3500 stores.  employee owned."
bad,"Loved the job, didn't pay much money learned all aspects of grocery.  Not getting any time off to visit my family.  Working with new people"
bad,I would hate to leave but I must due to relocation reasons.
bad,"Always helping out night shift why is there a night shift. "
bad,"Dead end retail environment. Demanding customers.  Short staffed. Poor pay. The management team will lead you to believe that there is a great future there, but that is just to get you in the door."
bad,Loved the people I've worked with but the pay here is ridiculous. The most you will ever make is $12 and that's if you have a Bachelors or a Masters Degree. I suggest you apply to work in a store. Baggers make more than the lovely hard working people here (who are educated and highly trained)
bad,there is no room for growth unless you're the managers favorite they undermind you and disrespect you jokingly i just do my job and go home i have a awesome team
bad,"Store policy & style is out dated with dress code & how employees should look (stepford wives aka clones), the rumours that the farthest from the base of Florida the less the company was following traditional store values is true. They only care about stats & what it should be not the actual stats which show dropping customer sales, high turnover & a toxic work environment.  Just not a healthy work atmosphere."
bad,"Some people do all the work, while others fool around, walk off their register, walk around, go on their cell phones, hide, duck from customers, and make believe they are working.  The management favor some of the employees and let them do whatever they want, while other work hard. It makes it so aggravating to work there. They seem to favor the boys/young men. They are always promoting the young men/ bag boys very fast while not promoting the women, or some women who want a different position. They favor the boys there.  They also promote bag boys to Cashier, however, they still end up bagging, while getting a cashier's pay. The only employees who benefit from this company are the Full Timers but it is almost impossible to get F.T.  I don't understand how this company claims to be the best place to work. Is that a joke???    I'm so aggravated here. I really want to transfer out."
bad,"Poor training, expected to work at a hard fast pace day in and day out. Publix wants you to have your life to revolve them. They want you to make Publix your god and sell out to it."
bad,"Publix has been by far one of the worst companies that i have ever worked for. Many of the reasons i say this is because they hire mangers that are not qualified for the job, and along with that you have NO JOB SECURITY. You will go from 20 hours a week to 7 hours a week, and they won't do anything to help you when you want more hours but give you excuses.They put there part-time employees down the drain while catering every need to full-time employees."
bad,"Honestly the title says it all. Managers change out way to much. They take YEARS to get you to full-time and move up people who've been there less than you into high positions. The customers are babied and it's quite annoying. Their pay system isn't good either for the amount of work you do, should be getting paid more. Publix is all about family and caring about their associates but it really isn't; my manager told me and I quote ""You really need to keep your bad days at home and really focus more on the customers, because they're priority."" And that right there really showed me what Publix is really about."
bad,"I believed in the company's philosophy when it came to taking care of his employees, however I found a lot favoritism from management toward friends which curtailed my ability as an out of townee to grow within."
bad,Terrible place to work. The fellow employees were to miserable work with and management was disappointing. They pay well and feed you at lunch but the hours are rough. I would recomend another line of work.
bad,Publix is a great place to work if you have a open availibility but for some that have chilidren and can't have a open availibity the hours are limited.
bad,If you want to move forward with the company start young....it will take you years. Management act like they listen or care and dont. There is no common sense in some of the department managers. They are afraid of there own shadows a d accountability is a lost art.
bad,The hardest part of this job is wanting to stay. You practically have to be a slave to the company to get full time and they give hours to their favs.
bad,"Although Publix prides itself on being a great place to work, they are stuck in the ""Good Ole Days"".  They have not moved forward with the times or technology.  Work Life balance is not something offered to hourly associates although it seems to be offered somewhat to salaried associates, but not as much as it could be.  Some departments have very strict rules, while other are more lax.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people.  Publix does hire a lot of good people, but the advancement opportunities have not been there in my experience.  The sick pay at Publix is almost non-existent.  If you are sick and use your sick time, it will show up on your evaluation.  They do not allow you to take your accrued sick time for a sick child, only if you are sick yourself."
bad,"So many people think this is an amazing company to work for and it's just not. they treat their employees like robots,you'll be ridiculed for doing basic human functions (such as using the bathroom, drinking water, calling out sick when your literally sick) Good first job or fill in job but not for the long run. trying to move up is so difficult. they basically want you to grovel for any kind of advancement."
bad,"Going into work was fine before I was diagnosed with vertigo/migraines. I worked in the deli, so I already had a rough go each shift before I was able to communicate to management that I had just been seen by my physician and my physician recommended that I be moved to the front service area due to light/sound sensitivity and overexertion in the deli. I was out of work for two months unable to return before HR shrugged and told me they couldn't accommodate me."
bad,Publix has changed a lot its not a place for growth unless you are one of their picks. Managers change as though they should but the same problems still occur with favoritism
bad,They only care about the bottom line. Management is inconsiderate and doesn't care about you as a person. Fulltime is nearly impossible to get. Hours are cut at 38 hours because the company is cheap. Product quality is going downhill. Company has a problem with nepotism.
bad,These people dont care about you and they dont help you advance. They dont pay enough for the hours they want you to work. Not family oriented at all.
bad,"Publix is not as good as it used to be in the past. They do not care about their employees any more. I have had a very bad experience with different district managers who treat their interns unprofessionally and barely communicate with them. I was a Publix intern trying to get a position as graduate intern, but I was treated with disrespect after contacting many district mangers asking for help. In addition, most pharmacists use you and abuse you only to help them and they do the very minimum to help you stay in this company. My advice to all interns/grad interns is to secure a job somewhere else because Publix is mistreating and kicking their employees out."
bad,"I started off in high school and it was not that bad. Over time it just got worse with new management coming in and out of the store. They do have tuition reimbursement as well as dental and vision care for part timers. Overall, if you are a college student I do not recommend this job. Hours are too inconsistent and you never have a set schedule."
bad,It is difficult to achieve full-time employment status. To move up is an arduous process. The job compensation is not equal to the stress you endure for the job. Scheduling is not good. Sometimes I work 6-7 days in a row and still do not get 40 hours per work week.
bad,"Don’t work for publix. Unless you are planning on making a career out of it don’t bother. Unless, again, you are a 16 year old trying to make some extra money. Just don’t do it"
bad,"Low wages, Minimal advancement opportunity, Fighting for hours, strict standards for physical appearance and promises of future financial security are all super common at publix. They won't give you full time, and they wont give you a competitive wage."
bad,"I currently work in the deli as a part-time deli clerk. The deli manager is incompetent and inexperienced. Inconsistent hours, low pay and poor communication skills between managers and employees."
bad,"One week I would be scheduled to work five hours then I wouldn’t be scheduled to work for upwards of 12 days. Being an adult and having bills to pay, this job was not a good fit for myself not only because of my medical conditions but because of the lack of hours."
bad,"Management does not care about associates as they say they do. Be prepared to treat publix as your number one priority or be looked down for it, even as a part-time employee. School schedules were not respected as they advertise. If they need staff, because of any unprecedented circumstance, they will make you work for the missing people. Sometimes these stressful circumstances go on for a long period of time without being resolved."
bad,"Only thing that differs from any big box pharmacy is script volume. Though volume may be less theres no time to spend with customers do to lack of technicians and just as many points of contact as CVS to fill with just 1 person. "
bad,If you enjoy working to the bone and being treated like an animal no matter how hard you work then this job is for you. Management lacks professionals
bad,do not work in the deil. it is unorganized. the store itself is good. but the managers tend to be very mean and have a snobby kind of attitude. the pay is not great when you start but there is potential to get more
bad,"helped customers with money issues, money transfer, lotto, changes, special orders, balanced cash drawers and vault nightly, trained new hires, closing duties"
bad,"Management is horrible! They will purposely make your reviews as an employee so bad that you cant get a raise or advance to a different, higher paying, job. They micromanage you. Give you horrible hours and dont listen to the hours you say you can work."
bad,I've had many bad events happen to me while working at Publix.   I've had my hours held over my head by management. I've been sexually harassed and threatened. Management makes it obvious who they do and don't like. Not much equality in treatment. Been told by former co-workers that the company has a quota to meet which is the reason for hiring minorities. There are a hand full of genuine employees but they don't amount to how many corrupt ones there are.
bad,"When I started Publix, it was because I was told how awesome of a company it was to work for. They always hype up the Publix name and brand, but then don't live it unless its going to effect their business of course."
bad,"I'm sure not all publix are like this. I've heard a lot of great stories, but this one was terrible. Started out part time with a schedule of 2pm-11pm, unfortunately there was never a single night we were allowed to leave at 11. The earliest usually was by 1am but even often extended to 4:30 in the morning. They wouldn't even let anyone contact their parents/loved ones/guardians that they'd be home late. Weren't even allowed 15min breaks. Also on some nights where I had worked until 3am or 4:30am, I was scheduled to work 3.5 hours later at 8am to 6pm. The managers were rude, smart mouthed, and careless."
bad,"At first the hours were 21 to 35, then ater a few weeks , with no notice, the hours were cut to 7. I asked the manager if I had done something wrong, he said no that everone was being cut, this was not true."
bad,"A typical day at work was busy, I learned patience. hardest part of the job was really nothing, It was fairly easy. I enjoyed helping customers find what they needed. I like to know that those who shop where im employed are finding what they need."
bad,Forced to work at such a fast pace that customer service was second priority. I did not get to personally assist customers with their pharmacy needs.
bad,"I am veteran of Publix from 1997-2003 and I loved my job then. I was prepared to make a career out of it but then my husband joined the U.S. Army and I was unable to keep my job due to relocating. I instead returned to Publix after an almost 7 year absence. I raised my 3 children at this time, while my husband was deployed and training, as well as working as an Air Traffic Controller. After my absence from the company, it seems as though it went ""down hill"" in a big way.  When I previously worked there, it was a family oriented environment, no matter which store you worked at.  The hours were reasonable, the pay was good, and I had job security.  As the years passed, and apparently some values were passed up as well, the company no longer seems effective in giving me what I need in a job.  I am no perfectionist, but I try to be at work.  I am also VERY loyal, this due to my dismay.  The ""family"" feel is no longer there, everyone is just a number anymore, and it seems as though Publix is a revolving door of job bidder. They take the lowest bidder to work for them, put them at rock bottom (no matter if you have previous experience or not), and all this with no worried because they know that if an employee falls through the cracks, there will always be another one to take their place.  This is NO way to treat your employees in my eyes and the eyes of others that I've spoken to.  I do not appreciate being treated the way I was.  My husband is a disabled veteran, I have three children in school, a house to maintain, and at the time, I was having physical issues because of the requirements"
bad,"better job opportunity, not very fair with how nurses treat and talk to cna"
bad,they keep flip flopping on hours I work each week and its not a dependable place to work.. I can't keep living on the pay I receive from publix.. Healthcare for part associates is very hard to get because we need 1500 hours in a year to qualify and they keep our hours down so we can't qualify.
bad,"Typical high school job, became more fiscally reponsible and taught me how to be respectful to managment and grow with a company."
bad,"Granted I was there during High school, but I started from 4 days a week down to almost 1 day a week."
bad,"Publix is a company that appears to have it all together from an outside perspective but as a current employee, I have seen managera sexually harrass and mentally abuse their employees. After several investigations they continue to get away with it. The compensation can be great as a manager however you give up your life."
bad,Job starts out ok but you find out soon no one cares about you succeeding. You are expendable and any time you make a mistake they will be so quick to fire you. Their family is more important than yours they will modify the schedule to make sure you never see your family around holidays but management will always make sure they are off. The pay is ok but they you get a raise once a year and no matter how good of an employee you are you'll never get the full amount.
bad,If you want a management position or higher and can keep up with the needs of the workplace it's a great job but be very wary of your coworkers. Everyone is friendly but there's always some sort of gossip. Coworkers will throw you under the bus and still smile in your face. managers have a hard time empathizing with employees so if you have an empathetic and hard working manager things will go very smoothly but it isn't common. If you're coming in for a short term paycheck while you focus on something you want to do full time the environment may not be ideal.
bad,"Little to no training."
bad,"Very poor management.  If you are a favorite you can get away with a lot.  If you do your job and follow  standards, "
bad,"Most of the associates are just there to collect a paycheck.  There is no real work ethic, no one is willing to put in any effort.  Process and procedure is not a focus with this group.  It is a ""I do what I want"" kind of place.  There is no accountability because management is just concerned with having a ""body"" there. (I am referring to the Deli Department specifically.  This only applies to my location as I have never worked at a different store.)"
bad,Got hurt there. After their doc said that was all they could do I went to VA . It took 2 years for v a to operate. Publix fired me for exeding the FMLA. Then turned down disability that I paid for because it was preexisting. The fouught unemployment because they said extra FMLA ment I quit
bad,"Publix used to be a family oriented company that cared about their employees, much has changed and employees are now nothing but a number. They suck the life out of their management, some weeks making them work 80+ hours (management is salary)"
bad,"People say Publix is a great company to work for and I agree if you are a teenager living with your parents. The Publix I worked at was horrible. The only cool people were my coworkers. Store Manager was strict and rude to his employees, customer service management was unorganized and careless and the customers were rude also."
bad,"The pay and benefits  are decent,  but it is a retail  occult  environment,  most the employees  are drunk with the corporate  kool aide. No work life balance, you will work almost every  weekend,  management  is mostly younger and inexperienced,  but they know everything,  know it all atmosphere,  it's okay money while you are looking  for a real job is all it is."
bad,I did not enjoy working for publix because they continuously hire and cause long term employees hours to be cut! Requesting time off was difficult! I enjoyed the customers!
bad,"Poor management, Lazy employees and lazy managers, take advantage of good employees and hold them part time so they can't advance or get full time benefits"
bad,Only full time people get any benefits and payed vacation and holidays you work full time hrs but get no benefits as part time deli has poor management no organization at all also seems to me all they give full time to is young people
bad,"The customer service job itself is very pleasant and has never been bad. The management, however, refuses to properly train their employees or help solve any problems that arise due to lack of training and bad work ethic. One particular problem that could have easily been solved with a conversation was never even discussed. I spoke to an assistant manager three times, the customer service manager once, the assistant store manager once, and the over all store manager once and nothing was ever done. They only work to please themselves and do not act like proper leaders. I have witnessed a manager tell an employee to punch out and go home if they have to use the restroom. Over all I love the business, customers and coworkers but the management is seriously leaving things to be desired."
bad,"Worked there for over 4 years. Never got full time, even between 2 departments. Managers are shady and they'll throw people under the bus for a pat on the back. Customers treat you like you're second class and managers NEVER take your side, even when the customer is clearly in the wrong. They practically invite customers to treat associates like garbage. Example: I once had a woman come through my line and buy bananas and her total was $2.08. She gave me a five dollar bill and a dime. I gave her $3.02 change. She began to berate me and cause a huge scene because she ""gave me a twenty"", calling me a moron etc., so the manager not only counted my drawer to verify (it was perfect to the penny) but also reviewed the camera footage and saw the woman had indeed given me a five. They then proceeded to give the woman her ""proper"" change. I was furious. They knew the woman was wrong and I was right but they management for that company panders to these people without a second thought. They are condescending and you only advance if you suck up to the highest people. If you're ok with being a brown-noser, then it's definitely the company for you. But if you have even the slightest moral compass, go somewhere where you'll be able to work with a little dignity."
bad,Was a good place to work back in the 90's. But every thing changed when they forgot about the employees. But I did get my CDL for free and was the only good  thing.
bad,"Crazy female assistant manager showed partiality treatment to the worst workers and none to the best workers. I left because of you and her mental health issues. I now she's been promoted to another city in NC, God help her department there!!! The pace is non-stop from punching in to punching out, very little training for new employees."
bad,"They failed to tell me that when signing up for a cashier or bagging position that you also have to clean the entire store, restrooms, outside, and everything. Pick up and put out rugs, run a floor machine, I didn't know about any of that. They also told me I would be hired to produce and then I was brought on as a bagger."
bad,"working for publix made me very sad, because it was never like on tv it was all lies: sure they had good benefits and I was a role model in the work place, but I wasn't well appreciated for all the hard work I placed into the work only by my peers that I worked with that's all no job advancements to a better career nothing it was all fake."
bad,Fast paced work environment. Be careful what you say when others are around the area. There are several cut throats in the warehouse properties. Security Supervisors will write you up for any little thing.
bad,I enjoyed working at Publix at first. I was very well paid but treated poorly. Unrealistic tasks were put upon me and I was scolded for not obtaining them. I left because I got sexually harassed by the baker and the store management didn't do anything about it. Infact they fired me before the manager filed the paperwork.
bad,It was a fun environment to be around love with that I was working with just need to have more hours and better pay and up the security more. Customers are great to talk with
bad,Most days are very fast paced which I enjoyed   They do not allow us to drink water while we are working which can be difficult on a hot day.  The staff at the front end were all good people
bad,Publix itself is not a bad company at all to work for but this location is poorly managed and it's employees exploited. I wouldn't recommend working at this store.
bad,"The company was a good place to work but the people there do not care if everyone succeeds. The hours and pay were horrible. Some weeks I would have 40 hours and others i would barely get 20, even after working there for 2 years."
bad,not enough hours and no benefits not allowed water at the register. Will clock you off register if close to having 40 hours. The only time you could get extra hours if they needed help in the Deli.
bad,Good place to work if you are single with no kids. Managers are uncoordinated and frequently change to another department. Work schedule is the worst thing and they are not flexible about it.
bad,"Every task needed to be done immediately, there was no prioritizing."
bad,"If you know, or suck up to, the right people, it's a great place to work. If you expect to get by on hard work, results, and making your team happy, you will be disappointed."
bad,I was undermined and never given an opportunity to advance in the company. To give 3 years to a company and receive nothing in return really says something about the management.
bad,although possible benefits are included favoritism greed and lack of overall care of employees is what u can excpect.Long hours dealing with pretty distasteful people and never an undersatnding of basic respect.
bad,"A typical work day as a cashier would be working a shift from 3 to 9 or 4 to 10.  They do not like to give cashiers over 25 hours a week.    They would rather hire 2 people for the 40 hours available.  Even if you do not need insurance due to being covered by a spouse, Publix will still only give about 25 hours maximum per week.  Publix only gave 30 minute lunch breaks.  I learned that if I stayed around long enough that I may eventually become a Customer Service Manager full time.  I learned that full time employees actually earn a lot of Publix stock.  I also learned that each time Publix opens a store, it is already paid for in full.  ( no debt)  It was extreme to ask cashiers to go outside and get buggies on cold days.  It was also unexpected in the job function to have cashiers wipe down the steering wheel and seats of the huge, toddler carts.  Also at the end of each scheduled shift, each cashier has to sweep and mop around their entire register.  It would be more efficient to have another person who was hired as a stock person or bagging groceries employee to do all of the registers at the end of the night.  There are NO employee discounts at all.  It is because they want as much money as possible going back in to the store for stock concerning the full time employees.  The hardest part of the job  for cashier was the shift always changed.  The most enjoyable part of the job was taking care of the regular customers who were so pleasant."
bad,Publix has lost its culture and work ethics.  advancement is not there Job growth is not laid out.  Pay is not competitive with other industies.  Publix stock isn't as good as what the stock market shows other companies
bad,"You are never guaranteed the hours you are assigned.  Unless you check your schedule every day, you end up reporting to work, only to find out that your hours have been given to accommodate a full-time employee.  You go many weeks with no hours of employment, therefore no income."
bad,i do not like publix when they say part time they really mean part time they only give me 12 to 19 hours a week thats only gas money its not enough to feed anybody out of just gas money.
bad,"nothing good to say. i wouldn't do publix again. the main and only good thing would be he stock benefits. other then that, i mean, you can give it a shot yourself. to each his own."
bad,"If it wasn't for the people I work with, I'd have quit already.  The pay to start is poor and people are already unhappy after only a couple of months. Management is inconsistent.  Some managers are really great and some are just mean.  I know if I last long enough, I'll probably have enough hours in to qualify for stock and a 401K match, but honestly it's not worth it.  As soon as I find something else, I'm leaving."
bad,Too many generations of family working at corporate.  Backwards/inbred and successful in-spite of themselves.  Hire outside talent and tell them to check what they know at the door and follow their antiquated procedures where the tail wags the dog.  Managers with zero experience in key areas.
bad,In order to save money our bonuses were cut right as the ceo gave himself a pay raise. I'd constantly get in trouble for 10+ hours of overtime even though management scheduled it without my say. We were purposely understaffed so they had less employees to pay yet they complained when I couldn't keep up while trying to do multiple people's jobs at once.
bad,"Not the same public as Florida More stressful in NC & TN, Not enough experience in Management. policy  are Different  at those locations and they don't follow the Florida publix Policy or cultural"
bad,Publix works their Deli associates very hard and stresses them out. Unless you are full-time employee you rarely see any of the benefits that are promised to employees. Management is horrible and slightly prejudice. The only good thing about my job is that I have met some really great customers and really great friends there.
bad,"A typical day at work was extremely fast paced and DRAMATIC.I learned a lot about food, keeping temp, etc.. Management, however, was HORRIFIC. Workplace culture was not so great. A LOT of immaturity and drama even from management itself. Nothing was ever done correctly, and no issues were taken care of. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep the smile on your face walking in there knowing nothing would be done about unbearable staff. The most enjoyable part of the job was communicating with customers and building customer relationships."
bad,even if you work your butt off they treat you the same as the people who barely work at all!! they offer tuition reimbursement but they refused mine even though they said i would qualify.
bad,Overworked and underpaid is an understatement. Very picky and unprofessional as well. Would not recommend a place to work. Over priced inventory and lack of knowledge by management to maintain clean work environments and healthy relations with other associates
bad,i worked for them for 17 years and they have changed dramatically.  It used to be a real family based company but that isn't how they are anymore.  Its all about the mighty dollar and pushing whatever the promotion was.  Being forced to push the campaign and being disciplined if you didn't preform to the managers liking.
bad,Work was constant and hard.Days off were assigned and weekends were rare. Vacation was based on seinority. Workers were not treated fairly especially African Americans.
bad,"I can't speak for the stores or other warehouses but this warehouse was awful. If you enjoy a place where managers care more about their numbers, reputation and looking good than their associates, this is the place for you. Immediate managers are great but upper management is awful. If you enjoy long hours, no life, always sore and be slave driven with no remorse this is where you wanna be. Free lunch everyday and free stock is literally the only good thing about working here. Turnover rate is through the roof because nobody wants to stay. If you like being abused and treated like a robot apply right now. The co-workers are the best, literally the only bright spot of working here."
bad,"Work load was always heavy. Low pay. Management unfair.Good, hard workers are overlooked because of ethnicity. Learned I will not advance with this company after nearly ten years if I did not conform.I enjoyed my work just not the company I worked for."
bad,"My 11 year career began in 2004.  I loved every aspect of working for Publix.  I was promoted to manager in less than 1 year.  I had aspirations of advancing to a regional supervisor position, but despite stellar reviews, I was regularly passed over for promotions and raises never equaled the amount of effort I put forward.  By 2008, it was clear that the new company directive was to double workload while reducing pay for not reaching ever changing and sometimes arbitrary goals.  Since I was salaried, but required to keep up with the ever increasing workload, I found myself often coming in early and staying quite late just to keep up, and I am extremely efficient.  I was working on average 10-12 hours a week that I wasn't being paid for, which is in essence a full day per week I wasn't being paid for.  The harder I worked and the more I accomplished, the more they put on my plate.  They have been systematically firing employees over age 45 for younger and cheaper labor.  Three local district supervisors and 1 regional supervisor that hired me actually stepped down because of the squeeze corporate was putting on its employees.  My supervisor, who was excellent at his job and really cared about his pharmacists, stepped down and was replaced by someone 26 years old and a pharmacist for less than 3 years.  The only reason I stayed as long as I did was because I liked the people at the store level I worked with day to day and loved the stock benefits.  I was ultimately fired for apparently having more than 9 errors in a 12 month window, however wasn't provided documentation and still"
bad,Start from the bottom and work up.  Great opportunity for recent high school graduates through young thirties.  Not a job/career to transfer into after acquiring several years of managerial experience outside the Publix DC warehouse.
bad,"the customers, nothing about the company is good. No one except grandfather employees get full time. Struggle to get enough hours a week to make it worthwhile."
bad,"Management was absolutely horrible. Upper management making lots of promises and not keeping them, Horrible safety and sanitation standards. Advancement unlikely."
bad,"I've learned over the years how to perform premire customer service, to always be aware for the products and new sales, and have had the exprience of cash handling for 5 years."
bad,This is not a bad place to work for.Most of the time it is fun & rewarding.Getting to know most of it's customers was fun.
bad,"most managers ,from top to bottom are to worried about themselves to help out the hourly worker."
bad,"Manager & Grocery Manager, used me to clean up messes from full time workers in Dairy & Frozen Foods. I was only part time with limited hours. I am a former Co-Manger with many years of experience wwith another"
bad,Particularly the one I've worked at constantly belittled the employes giving a sense of dishonesty. Higher-ups will mock you when you're at a time of need as well as threaten you occasionally.
bad,Go for the full time part time don't get the hours or benefits the customers are great but the staff needs work if part time you get between 19-25 hrs
bad,"I've worked in warehouse's for over 10 years, and Publix by far was the worst. Harassment was an everyday occurence. Management swept problems under the rug. HR and upper management has no sense of confidentiality, yes I know this first hand as they told my business to some associates and it spread like wildfire  within a day . Dont believe the things they tell you other than the great pay."
bad,"All you do is put items on the shelf and help customers. Anytime you have an idea or use your management skills as a team leader you get shut down by management. Rarely are flexible with hours if have other jobs and certain managers do not care about your life outside of work, like if have other jobs or dreams."
bad,"Promised full time upon hiring, each time i asked about the progress it was delayed, now i along with my whole department work an average of 20 hours. Terrible if you need the money."
bad,After the first couple of hours into the shift it starts feeling like work. When it’s slow and there’s nothing to do your forced to find something to do
bad,"Publix values the customer over everyone. I am a woman and was paid less than a man who had worked there a significantly shorter time than I had for the exact same job. Publix definitely favors certain people and is very concerned with maintaining their image  They really limit things like hair color, piercings, etc."
bad,"Publix only pretend employees own. Not true. Only for higher up , employees are nothing, store manager can fires you for speaking up , open door policy is a joke. Store manager abused their people, harassing them until they quit. Higher up avoid problem or solved any issues. They protect themselves, their wallets. "
bad,Most associates don't feel any corporate respect or benefits.  Publix allows no room for creativity.  I was reprimanded for verbally assisting customers.  How about customer retention?
bad,"You work constantly, little recognition for any tasks completed. Even going beyond what is necessary is not recognized by anyone."
bad,"Management is there for a check only. unsafe acts ,lack of  respect, the morale is low, turnover rate is high, don’t try to enforce a team environment"
bad,Don't dare make even one mistake. You are evil and shunned. Constant criticism.  Managers not understanding. Not enough hours. Pay very low for the enormous amount of work you have to do.
bad,Management in Publix supermarkets is subpar. Less hours are given to better workers due to the fact they are paid hourly more than unexceptional workers. When the math is done less exceptional workers make more per week than hard workers.
bad,"I have worked there for 10 years. A lot of those times weren’t bad but the work environment has become progressively more stressful. There’s little time available to be properly trained. Management if they’re good get moved quickly to a better store, however if they’re terrible then not quickly enough. I feel if you’re competent at your job, the management will squeeze everything out of you. Publix used to be a great place to work but not anymore."
bad,There is no room to grow at Publix...especially if you are African American and over the age of 35. They'll work you like a slave and the only thing you have to show for it is a few stocks.
bad,"There is not a lot of job flexibility unless you choose to stay in a role where you only get 8hrs a week. Managment doesn't seem to care if you get to use the restroom or not...I would wait almost 3hrs to use the restroom because ""it was busy."" And they dont care about safety for that matter. I requested to be moved out of the liquor store because I felt unsafe and they thought it was a joke. I had been harassed and chose to quit since after 3 months of asking to change departments nothing changed and I was worried my safety was at risk. I recommend you stay in the store where there are a lot of eyes to see what's going on because when you're on your own people act very differently and nobody responds to you if you have a "
bad,Publix isn’t the same company that I’ve once worked for. The manners are very rude and lazy. There is no such thing as team work. They don’t care about you as a person. They are very racist and if you have a disagreement or report the manager to upper management they will significantly reduce your work hours. It is very stressful
bad,"It could have just been my managers,  but the place was disorganized and stressful in every way.  Some staff was overpayed and under worked others are underpayed and over worked. Some people frankly should not have jobs with how much disrespect the show other workers and customers. I frequently have to work overtime to pick up slack from other workers.  And over all am very disappointed,  the management hired me for one job and then moved me to another job and won't let me go back to the initial job because I am one of the few customer service staff that does what is needed day to day."
bad,Manager was unfriendly and made the work environment poor. Inconsistent work hours in scheduling made moral poor.  The rest of the co-workers were friendly.
bad,"This is a great gig for students looking to get paid weekly for some spare change. However, do not expect to be scheduled more than 20 hours per week because, for the most part, it won't happen."
bad,The managers don’t care about your outside life at work. Super understaffed can Barley get time off. Managers always want you to make sure customers are happy but they are down your throat when you are not doing your job cause you are helping a customer.
bad,"I would not recommend working for this company unless you enjoy working for low pay, a cut-throat environment, and exhaustingly long hours."
bad,Excellent place to work. Opportunity to grow takes a while. Current store management no communication with the employees. Example changes to the store.
bad,"Flexible for college, but get ready to have publix as your life if you want to advance. I would have had a better experience if my managers were good at their job. However at the end of the day, if you don't want this as a career, get a job that will benefit your resume."
bad,"A typical day at work would be walking into Publix, going to clock in and going to the not so friendly customer service staff to see what will be your tasks for the day. At Publix I learned to not let other people's attitude affect your attitude. The management at Gardendale's Publix was recently replaced due to retirement and terminations. Honestly, there isn't a hard part on the job except getting yourself to put on those disgusting rain coats that never gets washed when you thought you were hired as a cashier and not knowing you have to bag until you come into work. The most enjoyable part of working at Gardendale's Publix is knowing that if you're punctual you will get a raise every 6 months."
bad,"A typical day is very busy w/many tasks/prioritizing daily duties."
bad,Publix would unfairly grade you based on what they think you did not with what you actually did. They oils give you slight pay raises and give you horrible hours.
bad,"At Publix, there is no such thing as a ""routine schedule"". Each week is different from the last. You live every week, week to week, not knowing if the next week you will have to open on certain days, close on other days, work mid shifts, etc. Publix demands that the most important thing in you your life be Publix."
bad,My review of publix after working there almost 8 years is that it's a face paced stressful environment. With managers with very little knowledge and experience (Poor overall management).
bad,"Worked for the company for 6 years. Trying my very best to get full time. Working overtime, doing more that was ever asked of me. They gave it to two boys and told me I needed to wait my turn."
bad,i have worked for publix as a meat cutter for several years  now i stay due to age and needing medical ins. i have had 3 dept managers one twice  of the 3 only one was a decent manager to work for. i have had 3 store managers all 3 were very poor managers. with the exception of the one dept manager all of them have been bias and unfair. they over work the good employees to compensate for the poor ones. no disciplinary action against poor workers and give same evaluations to everybody. may word different but all with in same score area. open door policy is a joke. have seen drugs bought and sold by employees on sale floor while on clock reported nothing done reported theft by employees nothing done . Now just go to work no extra effort will be given. after being with company nine years and have more time cutting than most still treat like a a rookie/clean up boy PUBLIX IS NOT A GOOD PLACE TO WORK
bad,"Publix is currently taking away the benefits that made it a great company to work for.  They pride themselves on their community service, but they do not compensate the employees when a store closes due to weather conditions  They expect the employees to volunteer on their off days to Publix sponsered events so the company looks good to he neighborhood."
bad,Just no hours at my store. I was told coming in by the store manager that I'd be getting 30-35 and I only get 16-24. The only way to get hours at my store was to be on call and hope and pray someone called in.
bad,"It is a decent place to work. They are big on customer service, the job itself can get boring at times. They will keep you busy one way or another. Going outside to get carts was the best part."
bad,Too many political favors and the way of the office.  If you follow the job requirements and follow your guidelines within your role to be successful none of that matters.  If you want to be respected and looked to for decisions you have to play the political game of doing favors and you get the same in return.
bad,"They don't care about you, you're nothing but a means to an end for them. They tell you you're easily replaceable, but they hire less than desirable people. They took away bonuses, but the CEO gets a $700,000 raise immediately after. Customers treat you like garbage and you have to take it with a smile. If you're not accustomed to boot licking, start practicing."
bad,"The customers were always different with various personalities and this makes it fun and interesting."
bad,If you don't have family in management you will never make it. i have trained 3 managers and never made it myself. I have worked with many hardworking people who are held back and paid low wages.
bad,"I spent two years with Publix and within those two years I got treated unfairly, I was told that I would never be able to grow with the company and spent almost two years as a bagger told that I would not be able to even move up to a cashier. I would NEVER recommend Publix to anyone. May be a great place to shop, but never a pleasure working there."
bad,"The best part of this job is interacting with the customers, it is a high stress work environment, severely understaffed, This job used to be fun and I looked forward to coming to work until corporate changed the work structure and and now tempers are short, people I used to love working with are angry all the time.  I left this job because I cry almost everyday due to extreme stress and hostile work environment."
bad,If you are trying to make a living doing this job start in high school or after you have retired. Otherwise it will only make life more trouble-sum and difficult.
bad,"Moral is very low! Lack of employee support. There are limited learning centers in the classroom with limited materials for children to choose. Materials are old, dirty and not enough for children to adequately create. Learning is limited and mostly focused on the cognitive development and not the whole child. Children are not supported in their development due to lack of child development knowledge. Teachers have limited time to do lesson plans and mostly completed on their own time. Most materials are purchased out of pocket. Leadership is not up to date with professional development resources."
bad,"working at publix consists of greeting customers politely, checking out their groceries, bagging them, and giving the customers a great experience everytime people choose to shop there. I learned how to multi-task, improve my customer service skills, work under pressure,etc."
bad,"Management is demeaning and rude to employees. "
bad,Publix was a fast-paced environment. I worked in the deli and it was not a very employee friendly environment. My department manager treated her employees unfairly. We were understaffed and the workload was overwhelming
bad,"Good place to work.  Great coworkers.  Management was terrible in all 4 stores I worked in.  If not in the ""it"" group or friends with the right people promotion/advancement is impossible."
bad,"The first two years I had two great managers which gave great raises. The district manager cracked down then gave five to twenty cent raises while hiring people at more than the senior people were making. Managers, District Managers, Regional Managers, and President now make way more than what the lower associates make. The gap is so big it does make sense and they cut certain benefits while insurance keeps going up. The long hours of closing and opening or opening and closing don't leave you a whole lot of time with family. CEO just gave himself a huge raise while they only raised their raises for associates a few cents depending on full-time or part-time associates. They need an overhaul from the bottom to the top. The stock is now too expensive to invest in for such low wages."
bad,"too much work and not enough pay, weekly meetings with management team, constantly going to other cities or states to open other stores, customer service, food prep and service, inventory, ordering."
bad,the atmosphere was very hostile and was a lot of animosity between the cashiers and managers. There was a lack of understanding and there were times when you would be scheduled without your knowledge
bad,Publix wasn't a bad place at all. I just was not getting any hours. Why? I have no idea but getting to meet new people and help them everyday was very exciting for me.
bad,"-The hardest part of this job isn't the job, it's the people you work with. There are so many childish people that will back-stab each other to get others fired, it's pathetic (and upper management actually believes these people.) Don't make friends with people and add them on social media. They will use anything you post against you. Fair warning."
bad,"Publix stores are managed by many people who have never done anything but work in a grocery store.   Publix benefits are good but not worth the sacrifice it takes to work there. Many of the managers I know who still work there are highly stressed and extremely unhappy.  Publix is not a great place to work for managers. Ultimately,  Publix is just like any other corporate work-place and primarily focused on making money.  Valuing the associate, as stated in the Mission Statement, is not practiced by most District Managers,  Regional Managers or RIS personnel.  George Jenkins would be disillusioned if he were to come back and witness what is happening in the Publix workplace."
bad,"i was accused of intimidating a co-worker without the chance to review the video.  i feel the word intimidation was used because of my size.  yes, i am a big man but i am not an intimidating man.  i am one of the nicest men you will ever meet.  i am ready to put what happened behind my and move on with my career."
bad,"Long hours. You go to work, get off and go to bed then wake up 7 hours later and have to go right back and do it all over again. Publix is all hype you think you're making a lot of money selecting making $28 an hour but you only make that for 20 hours. When you do the math for a 40 hour week you only made $16 an hour. Publix stock is the only pro to working for Publix. Managers are a joke; my 8-year-old nephew could do a better job. Publix claims they promote within before they hire workers from outside. Not true. I have worked for Publix for over 4 years and have 3 years perfect attendance and have expressed my desire to advance but, I get the cold shoulder every time. Advancement is all politics. It's all about who your fishing buddies are. I offered to take my supervisor fishing and still got the cold shoulder. I'm stuck under this glass ceiling. Everyone I know who has quit expresses their relief of being elsewhere. Unless you plan on going nowhere in life then this is the place for you. I have big plans and it's not worth $15 an hour."
bad,"It's like every other place, don't let anyone fool you into thinking it's special. It's a grocery store, nothing more nothing less. I won't complain and bad mouth them as that would be immature. However My summary pretty much says it all. It's not just me, I've seen many people go that were better workers than everyone else. People leave managers not jobs."
bad,The amount of hours and constant hassle of having the supervisors always telling you what to do makes work unenjoyable and stressful.
bad,ive been working at publix almost a year it started off decent but they dont give hours which you need to make money to be able to make a living i dont recommend anyone work there to be honest
bad,"Lack of employees hired, long stressful hours, bad management and poor problem solving management skills when a issue arrives. Lots of Business at my store and no needed help... they need to retrain these managers in the Deli at least how to :  Order, Make Schedules, and Organize because Full time and part time should not have to deal with management tasks to make up for it.  "
bad,"The manager I had did not seem interested at all that my family was going through very hard times. My mother was very sick and I had no way of knowing when she would have to be rushed to the hospital but when I would call to let them know she made me feel very guilty, She always had the biggest attitude towards her employees and always choose favorites."
bad,loved working there the people it was nice but it was to much favoritism there.i was told that i was going to be a meat cutter but that was a lie to when i was hired i was told i could change over to the meat dep when a opening is available so many people got hired and quit in a week they put me in the meat dep for 2 days out the week with no meat cutter pay till they hired someone else so i quit and went 2 winn dixe and got hire as a full time meat cutter. i feel like publix did not give me a fair changes
bad,"If you're part time sometimes they'll work you 3 or 4 hours after your shift, even when you tell them you have prior obligations they'll make you stay well after your working hours.  A lot of managers don't have people skills and talk down to employees."
bad,"I need more money and hours, but Publix is a great company, they day is smooth fun and alot of interaction with the customers as wellas management"
bad,"I worked at Publix for about two and a half years and let me just tell you that the negative things I experienced there vastly outweigh the positive. Just to name a few of them:"
bad,"Publix didn't have order in the bakery. Everything was a mess. Everyday someone would yell at you to go faster or something different. Most of my co-workers quit within a week so we only had two workers and the management wouldnt hire anyone else. The thing i enjoyed most was giving out cookies to thse little kids,seeing them smile made my day."
bad,"Publix wa built on the philosophy for providing superior customer service, and taking care of their associates, That is not the case anymore. Publix recently fired someone becuase he got into trouble because he did not follow proper policy, this associate has a disability, and they didnt know or understand that with the disability was part of the issue, He brought the human recourse medical documentation and some research of his disability, and they still fired him, without even taking his disability into consideration. They didnt acknolodge the fast that he has a disability and did not offer any type of accomodation or help to prevent this bad conduct from happening again."
bad,Publix although a good company was not for me. The location in which I worked was not up to par. The mangers were not trained well in customer service so the customers suffered because of that. The pay was pretty good but the benefits I would not know about due to the fact I was part-time and part-time associates at that time were not allowed certain benefits like bonuses.Overall it is a good company I just worked at a bad location.
bad,"Some employees are great to work with,while others could care less, which in turn makes the morale extremely low. Publix management at times seems to be disengaged.The hardest part of the job is to get everything done in the shortened shifts.But the most enjoyable part of the job is working with the guests,and the sense of achievement and accomplishment. "
bad,"cooked chicken "
bad,"On days i come to work which is 2 or 3 days out the week, I am asked to do way more then others. I learned at publix that it isn't about how hard you work, it's about if your the manager's favorite or not. The management you how to be one of there favorites regardless of your work effort. My co-workers are nice people some of them very easy to talk to, the others i don't really talk to on various reasons. The only hard part of my job is satisfying the managers and it hurts, I want to be that guy my manager will always look for, someone I can hangout with outside of work, being recognized by my work effort. The enjoyable part is cart duty, while I'm getting carts in the parking lot I can reflect on what I want to do in the future."
bad,"The culture that once made this one of the best places to work continues to erode. Every year, especially during a tight labor market, management expects more and more from the associates because they feel they there employees are trapped and can not find work elsewhere. The work/life balance has become completely one sided in that managers need to constantly take paper work home to complete it due to constantly being in the midst of production while at there location. If you are a white/male, you only have a chance of getting promoted if your district has met its desired culture/gender ratio so they won't be charged with another discrimination case. If you happen to hurt your self on the job, don't report it if at all possible, use your own insurance if you can; getting hurt at work will get you a counseling statement for unsafe working procedures and if the injury requires any ongoing medical attention, you will surely feel the push out the door from upper management."
bad,"Please allow me to pass on this topic. All I do want to say is, "" In all my years (16) at Parker, I have never experienced the things, and management like I have in this place."
bad,"I start my shift at 6 in the evening. I stand for 5 hours straight checking ou tall of my customersby greeting them and listening to how their day was. I learned alot of patience with this job due to the fact that we are dealing with so many different individuals. The management seems to be missing alot of times when we need them,sometines they are in the office having personal time. This makes it harder because I woild have to wait and hold up my line unitl a manger comes. I think the hardest part of my job i sdoing so much and going beyond but not receiving equal treatment. For example not getting enough hours,not receiving little incentives to let you know that you are doing a good job. It is usually my customers compliimenting me and praising. The customers are my favorite because they are the reason i love going to work althoug the pay is very low, i enjoy talking with them and having good relationship with them."
bad,Yes its work but your just some piece of dirt there that will work hours vary don't have an idea when you could get out ether early out way late managers suck if your not one of there buddies don't even try to move up.
bad,"I have seen the company degrade almost overnight. Despite posting large profits every year, the pay is almost equivalent to poverty wages. They continue to cut benefits, increasing required hours to be eligible. The only good thing is the stock they provide every year. Managers will take every opportunity they can to sell out their employees, and the hours leave little time for any sort of social life. You must be available on their schedule, based on business needs. Overall, a good place to work to get through school, but certainly not the ideal career path."
bad,"Publix has a vision for who they want to be in management positions. If you have the ""right look"" then you are more likely to get promoted. There are so many hard working employees who deserve to get promoted, yet they would promote someone who has no experience because they are friends with management. Not to mention the fact that an employee who sexually harassed multiple women in the deli was not reprimanded at all. He was transferred to another store which was more convenient to him because decreased his commute time by about 20 minutes! Its heartbreaking to love a company and work your hardest to get passed over for promotions, plus feel unsafe at work."
bad,Publix used to be a great company to work for when it was more family oriented now all corporate 🙁  People have to be fake or liked by a certain person to be promoted or on better schedule. Too many will stab you in back to get what they want or need
bad,Publix as a company is a great company to work for. But management treats you like a robot and not a human being. It is a very unfriendly environment to be in.
bad,"They can work you up to 35hrs or as little as 8 in a week with no benefits unless you can pay for them?! They will determine your travel reimbursement is too much after you've already driven back and forth to other stores to help out as you beg for hours during ""off-season"".  The manual labor causes strains/bruises/lumps/etc. If injured they make you drive miles away to their contracted facility (where they left stitches in - GIANT BLACK STITCHES) causing an infection and the one Dr at the facility says there isn't an issue. Management want to talk to each other all day as it helps them avoid giving free things to customers or providing backup for their employees. Management know of workers who have cursed at customers or purposely ruined items and do not remove them as they have worked for so long. (examples: the bleach hose being sprayed on the food and flooding the store by pouring daily grease down the drain! A shoplifter gets offended and they give them $ in gift cards. A customer makes frequent racist and homophobic statements and management is told and does not even apologize to the offended employees but offers an ""oh he's old"" to them instead of standing up for the employees). They would rather lose money than lose face. Meanwhile we are made to take verbal abuse. One of my coworkers was called fat and told to eat rice only. That customer is still a customer. Some pharmacists are great while others actively try to get techs fired. Several only follow the rules if they know someone if watching (i.e. telling you not to check ids for class 2 meds unless the regional mgr"
bad,Didn't like how they started me off $8.25 an hr. Took me long enough to learn the ropes because they were all over the place. Didn't like the raise policy as well.
bad,Part time are paid far less wages and benefits but do the same jobs as full time.  People culture is not so good with berating employees.  Managers do not manage employees but allow everyone to figure out what they will do.  Full time employees boss around the part time
bad,12 dollars an hour to most would seem like it’s enough. But as a stock clerk your job is so physical that the pay should start at 15 atleast. Great work life balance AS PART TIME. Full timer expectations are ridiculous. Do yourself a favor and only work at Publix while you’re in school or looking to expand on a career. Don’t let management brainwash you to get you stuck in a retail company where your constantly in stress over a supermarket.
bad,"I want getting enough hours to provide for my family, they want giving me enough days of work. I wasn’t able to do another department. Wasn’t going to make me full time."
bad,"It’s a nice place to work, but it just was not for me.  My coworkers were cold to me and often did not help me with things i needed help and improvement on."
bad,Management does not allow for growth/ promotion and provides little to no hours. Payroll is unfairly divided among associates and no compensation for holidays.
bad,"Publix needs to differentiate their language concerning breaks and lunches. A unpaid 30 minute, 45 minute, or one hour is a 'lunch' it is not a 'break!'  Employees working four to six hours should receive one 'paid' fifteen break. Employees working seven hours or more should receive two fifteen minute paid breaks and a unpaid lunch."
bad,"I really enjoyed everyone I worked with but I was talked to several times by everyone in management about my bathroom habits... I am female and I have very bad periods like heavy for months sometimes and I also have IBS. I told all the managers that talked to me and they didn't seem to care. I also get a dry mouth very easy and we weren't aloud to have a water bottle so every free moment I got I had to run to the drinking fountain and was talked to about that as well. Besides these issues and having no benefits and they showed no interest in advancing my career there as well as getting anywhere from 15-25 hours a week making almost nothing hourly, it was ok. Didn't mind the customers or standing in one spot all day and I loved my co-workers."
bad,"The benefits here are excellent, IF you have the hours to qualify for them. You need so many hours worked per year before benefits kick in, but getting those hours are near impossible."
bad,I wouldn't recommend them as an employer. They don't give you a set schedule and only give you your schedule a couple of days before it starts.  You could be required to work in the evening one day and the morning the next. They don't give full time either.
bad,"I liked working at Publix because I got to interact with people  and became familiar with the regular customers. I enjoy helping people and assisting in customer needs. The only downfall to this job was there no full time positions, and we only got around 20 hours per week. We were not offered benefits like insurance and retirement."
bad,"some days are slow, and enjoyed the customers, some management have there favorites and will give a hard time to others. You have to keep to your self and watch what you say."
bad,"I been there for four years applying myself to become a meat cutter and all I got back was false promises, Granted I was part time but I did just as much work as the full timers, cut meat, and take on  all the responsibilities as a whole, I never worked in the morning to receive good practice, especially after the manager and the assistant told me they were going to make it happen. They open easy and close hard . I realized that I was used for hard work and when it was not busy i was not scheduled"
bad,It was easy to work but slow and I felt cooped up inside. I got no fresh air during working. The most enjoyable part of the job was when friends came into the store and it was time to go home.
bad,I didn't have the chance to stay here long but it was a bad time that I work there the manager that was over me was not a nice man and he would harass his employees
bad,"Fake work culture. They are more concerned about the customers and the store's image than it's employees. They are very customer service oriented and that's not a problem, but what about your workers? Pay was reasonable."
bad,"Despite not being there long, my time at publix was a roller coaster of different coworkers, chaotic scheduling, and managment that seemed uninterested in worker needs."
bad,"Very inconsistent and poor work/life balance.  Compensation is generally lower than direct competitors, however expectations for customer service is very high as well as expectations to be available to come to work on off-days at a moments notice.  Exceptionally high employee turnover."
bad,I got tricked into working as a front service clerk which is a fancy name for a bagger. I asked them if I can be a cashier and they didn’t do anything
bad,"I was a GRS, I stocked shelves all day . Good company to work for . Management wsa to bad . I just didn't make enough to live on or progress in life ."
bad,I didnt really enjoy my time at publix as it was not a great fit for me. too far of a commute and too many people so not enough hours available to work
bad,"Simple cashiering job with a schedule that is wildly inconsistent. Coworkers are either very helpful, okay, or absolutely terrible. Customers are generally alright, but some are ridiculous. Management needs a lot of work."
bad,I loved Publix at first with first store manager  and second store manager was very difficult to work with! I used to receive 30 hours a week and all the sudden i was getting 4 to 12 hours a week. Management showed favoritism big time  and pay more to  new hires. The company was the ideal job worked well over ten years. Great job for high schoolers and college kids.
bad,"You will never be scheduled full time or be eligible for benefits. Other retail companies pay better and offer benefits. Many departments are extremely high volume and stressful work. I would only recommend if you enjoy long hours standing, unable to take restroom breaks, no employee restrooms must use customer facilities, very stressful."
bad,"Managers will hire, hire, hire new people; leave long-time employees begging for hours. Nobody can live off 10 hours a week. Yes Publix does have nice benefits but that's the only good thing about it"
bad,"Just total WORK environment..."
bad,"Management always took me away from cooking because they could not scandal people for what the need was, so i would be in the deli or cashier or stock, not what i wanted to do"
bad,"Working at Publix progressively became worse as I had been there for longer. I was hired at the minimum wage, which was fair for a sixteen year old part-time bagger. However, I became cross trained in many areas and received little extra compensation. After two years, I noticed new hires who had a fraction of my knowledge or my drive yet were paid considerably more than me. My direct department manager was an unsupportive woman, and I often heard upper management talking about our store in a bad light and commenting on how they hated their jobs. It's tiring to work somewhere that not even your boss wants to be."
bad,on a typical say i would either bag groceries or cashier. i learned to deal with customers and execute tasks through teamwork. overall a good experience.
bad,"Publix is dreadful. They give me no hours because of ""Minor issues"". i had most of my weeks with only 2 hour shift for the week. My paycheck every week comes up to $25. Not only are they unfair about the hours they give out but they make you act so un-naturual. i could never be myself or points will be taken off. I want to be taken serious but be able to work great with you as people and not as slave workers. Thankyou."
bad,"This company is okay, it’s not the best but I appreciate working there because it helps to pay my bills. If I get enough hours to be able too,my store managers are rude,mean and judgmental."
bad,"You will not advance in Publix if you are not friends or constant kissing up with management. Hardwork reflects nothing at Publix. Drama is part of the job. Management doesn‘t care about you if you‘re not close with them. You receive almost nothing if you‘re not in management or full-time. Unbelievable amount of gossip and drama within these stores which makes it unprofessional and makes associates miserable."
bad,"Im proud to say my work is the equivalent of 3 individuals working for one basic salary. I didnt achieve the goals the company set for their workers and with less hours and salary at cost, I left for more positive opportunities."
bad,"A typical workday is answering customer inquiries and fielding customer complaints. At the same time, supervising employees, coordinating workflow activity, answering phones, selling lotto, doing western union, checking people out, processing returns, and also ensuring our products are stocked."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working here unless you are a high schooler looking for some extra money."
bad,"Publix used to be an environment easy to work at with many opportunities to advance, and your managers would work with you so you could achieve your goals. Now, it is more about how much use they can get out of you before you becoming one of the high-turnout rate statistics."
bad,Publix doesnt pay much and they work you  to the bone. They expect so much from you when you receive so little in return. Would not recommend to anyone.
bad,"I worked at Publix starting in the Deli, and then moving to receiving. Due to the number of young employees there was much ""drama"", however I went about my business doing my job."
bad,Loved working for Publix it was great opportunity for me and I got so many raises and helping hands form all the workers just a great environment to work for.
bad,"Not willing to work with you on your hours, very rude management and employees. Not understanding, and very unfair as far as personal issues and hours are not guaranteed."
bad,"It's typical retail, if you plan to make this your career just know that it could take some time. It's best going into this while your still in high school, I say this because of the barriers to making this a career. Getting full time and any thing leading up to it could take time, even if you work hard there may not be any room at your location for example, just worth thinking about."
bad,"Very stressful and little to  one back up or support from management. Any problem or conflict was yours to deal with, was taught to talk down to people under me in a non caring manner."
bad,"Too much work with little to no help"
bad,goood place too work for but bad hours that they provide good employees but lazy management and bad communications and bad pay far job from home .....
bad,"I enjoyed the customers for the most part. didn't like the fact that my 31 yr old mgr could sleep with a 20 yr old customer service gal, but couldn't guarantee me enough hours to pay my bills."
bad,"Great company for someone with no edudcation. If you are having a hard time finding a job and want one with the ability to advance without any kind of education Publix is great but for people that want a life outside of work, Publix is not a good fit."
bad,The opportunity for advancement is not there. Good company for someone who is in high school and has the years to wait to move up in position. The pay scale is on the lower side.
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job was working with customers. Had many wonderful friends there. I had the best customer service manager. A typical day at work was constantly checking customers out. The hardest part of the job was trying to stay out of trouble with management.
bad,I didn't see any room for advancement.  I said in my interview that I needed full time employment and was told that even with my previous retail experience it would be at least a year until I was even considered for full time employment.
bad,"i always heard that publix had such great benefits, and was a nice work environment. i was a cashier there for 8 months. I was offered no benefits, and no raises. My manager was rude. The only good part about the job was you got hour long breaks. If you shift ended at 4, they would make you stay at the least 2 more hours. "
bad,"Publix was a very fast paced environment. Especially on Sunday's after the church hours are over. The bathrooms weren't always the cleanest, so I usually took initiative to clean."
bad,Might just have a bad manager but everyone at my store hates it and wants to quit. In my department you either work 10-6 or 2-11 and if your not full time you usually only work 2-11 which gives you no personal life.
bad,Horrible place. I hated working here. Long hours with very little pay the only good thing about working here is that they worked with me well when my son got sick.
bad,when I worked here I was in hight school with not much to worry about however I remember my time there and i don't have anything bad to say about this company
bad,"There is not room for much advancement in this company.  Also, the hours were not ideal for someone who wanted to have a normal lifestyle.  The hours were never set unless you made it to the manager level."
bad,Good place to work. Has begun to go downhill due to the nature of the employees it hires now. They would rather get cheap labor and work done half hearted than to pay good to someone following there procedures and doing the work correctly.
bad,"Definitely some old school thoughts here, and in some ways it's good but not in a lot. Lots of creepy old dudes working here, definitely not a friendly environment for woman."
bad,was made without proper training to make subs. dont try to do what you learned during training you will never be able to complete it. be expected to pull more weight than anyone with more on the job time than you.
bad,Good company with lots of benefits and opportunities to grow. Many of the people within the company were great and encouraged doing your best. Workplace was difficult at times but rewarding .
bad,They work well with you and listen to their employees. If you have any trouble they will try to solve the issue. Some places do not have good management so trying to talk to one may not help .
bad,"It's a nice place to work at. Fun environment, sometimes friendly customers, it's a okay type of job. A lot of high school kids working there though.."
bad,"Publix company in Lakeland is a very biased company it is not what you know it is who you know. But the company has great benefits but as far as getting a raise, it is not based on your skills."
bad,Publix does not pay enough to have it as your only full time job and does not work with you if you have a second job and moving up in the company is very hard as a woman!
bad,Worked as a bagger for a bit then advanced to a produce clerk/fruit cutter and it instantly became a sad place to work with impossible standards and day to day insults
bad,"Company is good but need more structure in this particular location. I loved it when I started there. However, everyone wanted to be the ""boss"". I work hard and wasn't compensated for all the work I've done."
bad,"My experience with publix was stressful from worrying if i would have hours one week and not the next. The people I worked with were all pretty nice, and great friends. The customers are extremely kind a majority of the time. Management can be a bit scrambled at times."
bad,"Not enough help provided to the pharmacist"
bad,pretty busy day breaking down the truck stocking produce on sales floor. management was okay but not fair at times. my co-workers were all old and slow. hardest part was dealing with all the rules of the place. I enjoyed the people there
bad,"I worked in security in Lakeland at different guardhouse posts. My last post was the worse. My supervisors allowed the warehouse supervisors to boss us around. They kept loading us up with paperwork and extra duties that they didn't want to do. Our security department didn't care about what they put on us. We were treated with disrespect and had to deal with insults horn blowing, and cussed by fellow associates and truck drivers. That was the worse job I have ever had in my life. The company creed says everybody should be treated with respect and dignity. The security department had low moral. Nobody respected us. We were used and morally abused. That wasn't the Publix I signed up with to work for."
bad,"Not much to expect from a part time job, Publix is better than some, but worse than others."
bad,"typical day is usually fine, you make sandwiches or cut meats and cheeses for the customers or your working in the kitchen usually cooking for the hot case or rotisserie."
bad,"Some days were absolutely fabulous, others were completely horrible. In order to provide ""Premier Service"", as the company founder wanted, there M U S T be adequate staffing !!! Other co-workers and management were awesome to work with, I would do it again if given the opportunity. When enough people were scheduled to work, everything seemed to flow smoothly without any hiccups. On the flip side, if the schedule was arranged with a lack of help (95 % of the time), customer service would suffer tragically. Whence there is a shortage of help, it fosters other associates working faster and harder to attempt to maintain the performance metrics set forth by corporate. Therefore, whence someone is working faster just to keep up, there will inevitably be a marked increase in the potential for a fatal medication error. This issue has never been addressed by corporate. Whence the company founder passed away (April 8, 1996), the vision of the company completely shifted focus away from what built them - THE CUSTOMER !! - to the root of all evil - money. If the ""higher ups"" that sit in a bid corporate office would take time to come down and meander with the true backbone of the company and work like we do, then they would possibly begin to have an understanding of what takes place below them."
bad,A good company to work for if you start young but not a good career if you want your career to start soon. They are very strict and I've witnessed associates get written up for an excess of 3 minutes longer than allowed on breaks.
bad,"Just recently, one of our managers was told that he was, ""Too honest.""  Take this to your discretion."
bad,"Working by greeting people and cashiering. Eight hours a day in a high level mall.You believe, how  big the company name is. That the employers would be nice. It wasn't the best experience for me."
bad,"As much as I might like to say something good about a company that was talked up to me before I joined the team, I can't, at least not about the Publix @ Paradise Shoppes of Apollo Beach."
bad,Good management. Plenty of room for advancement. Job security and great crew to work with. Pay was adequate but not quite enough as I was having to dip into my savings. Close to home.
bad,"Their mission statement doesn't match the actuality of daily life there. Honesty isn't the norm. Hardest part of the job is dealing with favoritism and petty quibbles. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with customers and cooking. I've always enjoyed cooking and baking and making high quality foods. Upper management is inefficient, always looking to pass the buck. I believe in empowered associates but the tail is wagging the dog there. I never got the whole 'rat race' statement until I worked for Publix. Now I do. Apologies for negativity but it's the truth."
bad,"management was bad, but my coworkers were terrific. the job wasnt bad at all"
bad,"Bom local trabalho, mais não me deram valor, em relação ao meu lado profissional."
bad,"Part time job will not sustain you due to low wages and hours. Hrs are unpredictable and schedules are unreliable, change from week to week. No consistency is accepted, meaning you are scheduled when and if needed or not and only a few select can count on their work hours to remain consistently the same and at same times. Why?? They have their reasons. Training is non-existent, go figure it out you're told. There are never enough employees at the deli to effectively serve customers and therefore cleanliness suffers greatly. The manager doesn't care, she has her won issues and tells us non-stop about them. This is the most unprofessional place I have ever worked and hope to find a new position soon. Most new hires stayed about two weeks if at all. It's too hard they say, and yes, it is extremely hard, physically and emotionally. I asked for a transfer and was told ""it's not happening"". I was offered cross-training in another dept. but it never happened. "
bad,They really worked around your hours but that was the only positive aspect of the job. Co-workers were obnoxious and the management didn't do a good job of keeping their employees productive.
bad,"Publix is known as a great company to work for by anyone who has not worked for them.  Don't get me wrong if you start working there when you are 16 and work part time thru school and come back you probably have enough time with the company that you can squeeze into a desirable department and one day when your 30 start making decent money.  The pay is garbage.  No better than walmart or any other mass retail starting at just above minimum wage and raises are very hard to come by. I came in with a college degree in business mgmt and 6 years of experience including being a store manager.  They started me at $10.75 and promised big things.  I got promoted 3 times in 4 months and have not gotten a raise even though I now run a dairy department. They have a crazy attendance policy that allows for 16 tardies and 13 absences every 6 month period and then RESETS.  So anyone who is not getting promoted or is maxed at their position basically works at their own leisure at the expense of everyone else.  The only threat is you will not get a raise of $0.50 for that period.  I work in the grocery department which is the one that you want to avoid at all costs.  The work is brutal physical labor, terrible hours (starts at 2am, 4am or 6am) depending on your store and title.  And everyone is disgruntled except management.  Even they are not happy because they have no tools to get rid of terrible employees since job security is way too overzealous.  I have never worked at a place that has so many people walking around taking advantage of the system and others who think they are great at their"
bad,"one a customer told me her shopping wont be great without my help.  I`m learning some language as Spanish, India, etc. the management is wonderful they work as the associates. The hardest part is to be off and to not see ours friends and associates. the most enjoyable part is to help customers."
bad,"there is a lot of stress put on the customer service aspect of our jobs, however they also put on a ton of stress to get the product out in fifteen to twenty minutes. im sorry but when a customer hands in nine or more rxs i dont think it is responsible to put that short of a time limit. we are not flipping pancakes. "
bad,Very misleading. Your are brought in thinking your opinion will be heard but all the company cares about is sales.
bad,Its a lot of work for any unsung individual. I went unnoticed for a lot of my efforts in trying to keep things on the shelves and neat. The management team weren't the worst but they were no where close to par. My co workers seemed to hold in a lot of tension and resentment. The hardest part for me was working around the scrutiny and bad moods.
bad,I enjoyed working with the people at Publix and learned a great deal from them.
bad,The only benefit at Publix is the stability of the job.The work culture is very bad and its my worst career experience.
bad,I started out waiting on people an bagging there stuff. This was a food store.. A very busy food store
bad,"i loved the way this company gave back to the community, it also gave the employees stock in the company...bad management choices"
bad,I know many employees in other areas may disagree with my opinions but I have only my experience at store #738 Post road Commons in Melbourne Florida to judge Publix by.
bad,"No enough hours. No room for advancement.  Hired as a cashier and been bagging and retrieving carts, for 3 months."
bad,"It’s a good job fresh out of high school but not for long term, it’s too many hoops and hurdles you need to bypass just to get notice."
bad,Is a really good company to work whit. But is just the stored that I am that is not good at managing. But overall is a really good company. Is a really hard to get on the company so once your in your in.
bad,Been with this company for 3 years and anything I have learned has been from visually watching others do the job never received any proper training and when asked to properly train hours where cut back so I’m searching for a new job that will take pride in employee’s that are eager and willing to learn and advance their career
bad,I decided that it’s time to go because Management is not what it used to be. It’s a money game and the hardest works are abused and not paid what they deserve.
bad,"A typical day at work consists of having restock the store, work the daily delivery, and review your counts/ order.  The culture is all about promoting from withing, making the whole system VERY political."
bad,Overworked and underpaid management does nothing to appreciate anything you do no matter how hard you work. Coming in early or on your day off they just want you to be a robot and have no outside life.
bad,"Publix played so much favoritism .. That's the most bullied place I ever worked for , management didn't believe you . I was so stress out . I prayed to get out of there."
bad,It was great I got to communicate and make people happy and still do work and Publix was one of the best jobs I had really easy everyone there is nice
bad,"The politics outweigh the professionalism. It’s like working in a high school with classmates as co workers. Cliques and all. If you aren’t in the group, they won’t let you advance."
bad,Its not a bad company I just wouldnt recommend it because they dont really get whether to let a person have a life or just make them work all the time.
bad,"Publix has a very good name for themselves in the service industry world. If you build a little credibility with the company for a year or more.It can advance you into a better opportunity down the road.although, Publix will take ful advantage of your life and work you to death. When it comes to your evaluation. They will use anything they can to keep your raise to a bare minimum. No matter how many days you come in on your days off or stay later out of good heart. Any little problem will effect your overall evaluation or even worse demoted. Seen it many times. 15 year veteran hard workers being demoted back to an associate."
bad,Slavery for pennies no job advancements always promises to get hired permently and customers are disrespectful wouldn’t refer to anyone trying to live on Publix
bad,Understaffed is not uncommon. And expecting you to complete production while waiting on customers was a little impossible. PT employees will get 40 hours a week.
bad,"Management is poorly trained, and does not prioritize training associates. Every problem branches from there. "
bad,Publix hires nobody in the door fulltime.I was promised 30-36 hours per week and never got more than 21 hours per week. I couldn't afford to remain where I was living on those hours.
bad,"After spending 5 years as a part time deli associate, I decided to move over to the meat department. I worked in the seafood area for 6 months when I was told I'd be receiving a full time position. I was later told that I would not be receiving the position. I decided to try to transfer to a different store. They told me for an entire month that all my ducks were in a row. I went on vacation for a week and when I returned, I was told that I was too valuable in my current position to allow me to transfer. It appears they'd rather see me quit than move up with the company. I'd love to say it was a fun ride and recommend the company to others but unfortunately, I cannot in good faith suggest that anyone choose this employer for a long term career path."
bad,Management takes no responsibility for their actions and panic easily. schedule is incosistant and if you're not liked your hours will suffer. Lack of communication is very common.
bad,"I was not fond of my time at Publix, I worked them for 2 years and throughout the experience, I found that the raises were terrible and the work environment never improved"
bad,They try theee hardest not to give you raises. I was in management making only 13$ an hour and had cashiers and baggers making more than me and when asked about such a low pay raise they had no answer. Management is horrible they care more about customers than the well being of their workers and always try to blame somebody else for anything so they don’t look bad. It’s good for a part time job maybe but don’t get fully into the company they will literally drain you from inside out.
bad,In the grocery department there is a lot to learn about time management and logistics.  Taking passion in keeping inventory is the best way to remain productive and learn about business in  general.
bad,I have never worked for a company that makes you feel more insignificant than Publix. A manager actually told me that I was expendable. They are currently hiring associates at the same rate of pay that took me 5 years to attain and they are not compensating me accordingly.
bad,Raises promised but never followed through upon. Management expects more work done than humanly possible for the timeframe. Management refused to hire more associates to cover workload.
bad,"Ok place to work, barely get any hours. Management is decent there very stressful place to work nobody is on the same page associates dont get recognized for their hard work"
bad,Management cover each other behind. Losing good employees because of a particular supervisor. Managers dont do noting about him either and a lot of favoritism as well
bad,"Working for Publix was once considered to be a great job choice for anyone. 15 years ago i agreed. After working for them recently I could not say that it is even a moderately good place to work. Customer service in most every department has become despicable. The employees that are hired are not the type of people that I would want to help me or my Mother, or anyone I care about. People who work there are generally very rude and unhelpful, and do not care about helping customers or doing their job correctly as long as they get paid and get to go home everyday without any repercussions."
bad,"It was my first job and i never felt i got treated fairly, I had managers threaten to punch me in the face. Yell at me for not wanting to be on Express (10 Items or Less) every day i worked for 8 hours. I felt like a faceless employee that didn't matter to any of management. "
bad,A typical day at Publix is only interesting and tolerable as it relates to serving the customers. The customer service staff and management at my location wasn't pleasant.
bad,You don’t get a lot of hours because they hire so many people and then start cutting people hours who always come in to work and work they just hire to many people and then when they don’t come in they call you in to take the hour they took from you
bad,"Publix has a Lack of hours and pay. Customer Service Manager needs improvement managing employee. Other than that, you get to interact with customers and staff."
bad,"A typical day at work at publix is your going on the cashier and then you will bag a little bit if needed then go get carts outside."
bad,"This job gave me a small amount of hours for the pay I was receiving. I would ask for more hours but my managers did not seem to care. While the job lasted me a year, it was not worth my time."
bad,"I worked in Deli´s department  in 2 different Publix Store. Both was given promoted and benefits according the country you are coming. The last one, the manager uses to give me 5 hours weekly to work. I got make a complain to the General manager, he just fixedwithher giving  me 11 hours weekly and after my seasonal period, no hired me anymore and all Publix nearby me was advised not contract me because that General Manager toldthem I am a problem girl."
bad,It was an ok workplace but I have different career options I am interested in so I can better myself. The staff are not that great although I do have quite a bit of friends there.
bad,"Publix was a great first job to have as it taught me many things about customer service and interacting with my coworkers, but it is extremely hard to advance in Publix corporate and managers were very obvious about picking favorites."
bad,They don’t give enough hours then try to call you in when it’s your day off like that’s ok when they should’ve put you on the schedule to begin with then get mad when say no.
bad,"good company but its not how hard you work its who likes you,they portray this great company but from the dms down they stab you in the back and make promises they dont keep.they all play the game to get a good review by associates but none of them care"
bad,"So I’ve been with Publix about 7 months in the deli and I’m already ready for a new place to work. The Deli isn’t all that bad but i will say it’s definitely gotta be the busiest department in the whole store. I’m a part timer so i get no benefits but my pay is pretty good. Hours range but lately been more consistent like 25-30 hrs.  I think the biggest problems i have with my location is the snobby customers that come through (which we are expected to satisfy their every need with a smile) no matter what because the managers don’t want customers to complain and the large workload in the deli. With this job there is no time to sit unless it is your 30 min break. So if you work a 10 hr shift you will be on your feet for 9 1/2 hrs. I’m pregnant now so this has become much harder on me than it was before. But what frustrates me mainly is when we have enough employees scheduled but some associates will run off in the back and find something else to do so they can avoid helping customers at all cost. So what’s that mean for me? Sometimes I look around and I’m literally the only employee on the floor. There is hot case, sub bar, and cold cuts! So i guess I’m suppose to man all three of those stations alone or until someone comes out of hiding when i call for help. My manager is a pretty good manager. She definitely works with me when it comes to my schedule but as for the full timers it doesn’t come that easy and they will take advantage of you and make you work crazy long hours. Also i will say my managers rarely ever help us on the counter when we really need it. You will walk back"
bad,"I transferred from one store to another so my store manager slammed me on my review, stating that i accomplished every goal but still gave me negative ratings. I've been worked to the point of collapsing. I would not recommend working at Publix."
bad,My time here was short lived as the store manager at the time only cared about his job and how the store was running.  normal days consisted of packing groceries and and taking them to customer cars.
bad,As a whole the company itself is not what it was when it first started. Upper management has little knowledge of the inner workings of their own stores.
bad,"work days were always stressful and extremely busy."
bad,I wish I could say that what Publix tells you is true. My experience with them and seeing others experiences with them does not put them in a positive light in my mind. They are only interested in how much work you can do for them. Only a few are given the opportunity to rise to the top.
bad,"I worked for Publix 2 and a half years and they treat you as if you're not needed. I understand that you can be replaced easily but, don't act is if my presence is not needed."
bad,"In Publix Corporate the office day to day feels like an episode of House of Cards (Very political work environment). There is a clear sign of favoritism from most ITDMs and Senior management causing career development issues for anyone below them. They do not pay competitive wages other than initial entry level positions, and you will not get a promotion in your first 4 years, regardless of work ethic or performance. The most common phrase used in the company is ""We sell groceries"", hinting at the fact that Publix is not a technology company, Thus they don't feel the need to invest in technology or associates jobs around technology. A lot of new associates leave the company after 6-12 months adding Publix as a resume line item."
bad,"I didn't hate the job, I just didn't love it. It was really unorganized and very much so chaotic. I feel like if I would have had a different supervisor that cared more it would have been different."
bad,"The hours are so inconsistent, there is no way to set a budget. During busy times, you may have 30 hrs, during slow times, 10. They will often schedule you for only 3 or 4 hours, including in the middle of the day on a Saturday. Your whole day is taken and you earn pennies. There is no advancement if you don't know someone in management."
bad,This was my first job. It's not a bad job for a teenager. The management at my location was horrible. I felt like I didn't matter to any of my supervisors.
bad,It is an average job. The benefits are good. Moving up the corporal ladder is possible but depending which department you are working in. Some departments offer better career growths. I recommend meat cutting or Pharmacy
bad,"Very dysfunctional and unorganized environment. Management communicates poorly with employees. Don't let the orientation fool you. Only positive thing for me was the weekly pay and flexible work schedule.  Workers I feel are underpaid for the work and STRESS that is required. "
bad,Lots of unfairness here---office politics are high here--treats older employees unfairly and places some younger people in leadership positions that do not deserve to be where they are--lots of back-biting behind closed doors--
bad,I am a bagger and I absolutely hate it! The customers are pretty nice and sneak in a tip once in a while even though we're not suppose to accept it. The job itself isnt hard just the managers make more out of it than it should be. Although I'm suppose to bag groceries most days I am the store custodian not what I signed on for. Forget moving up it is near impossible to become full time and lately I have been making 9 hours a week while high school kids make more!  I have begged to move to another position but have been told there is no spots but new people are hired everyday.
bad,Its alright but im getting barely getting any hours right now so its making it difficult for me to move. Managers are decent but the store itself is in shambles.
bad,"good company overall. hours could be rough, lots of weekends and nights, but lately there is a new thing, lots of overnights and no need resets and store changes."
bad,"Because of the retail atmosphere, most managers expect completely open availability to promote to full time.  If 1 works hard, there is room for advancement."
bad,I like my job at publix but I feel the pay and hours are not serving me. My manager is not fair and does not treat all workers with as equal. The hours are continuously decreasing.
bad,"Publix is the fall back career if everything else in your life falls through. They tend to secure long term employees with promises of benefits and advancement, however advancing to a position with good pay often takes many years or even decades, unless you know the right people. Managers are often overly stressed, overworked (60 work weeks are the norm) and project their self hatred onto the employees. Okay job to have while in college."
bad,"Started almost 5 years ago when it wasn't that bad. Now the management is horrible, half of the managers can't do basic math. New rules are made every day and it's hard to keep up with all of them. The co-workers are great and make the job less stressful. Publix is known for their stock producing millionaires, people don't really know that they're dwelling on the past. The stock is horrible now. If Publix doesn't keep up with technology they will be left behind and no longer exist."
bad,Work life balance was awful especially being a mother of a 12 year old. Very tough at first considering I was only getting 5-6 hours per week. Managers were extremely demanding on only a select few employees while others were given special treatment.
bad,"Bad administration and management, they wouldn't let me change my hours after I told them about school it took me a while to finally have the schedule I wanted. It's a good place to work depending what publix you work at."
bad,"Non stop work"
bad,Worked for them for six years. They call you in on your days off UNPAID to give you a speech about how everyone else is doing better than you and you're doing a horrible job. Terrible management. Terrible CEO. This company is going down hill. Thank God.
bad,The employer matched contribution to associate's 401k plans and company stock given annually to qualified employees is a good benefit.
bad,"Everyday I would work extremely hard at Publix. Management at Publix were great sometimes and unfair at other times. my co-workers were ok . The hardest part of the job was not being able to find my place in the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was the bonuses, and company benefits"
bad,"A day at Publix entirely depends on your outlook and sometimes the attitude of your customers. It was fun for the first couple of years, but after a while the managers began to devalue the employees. Perhaps it was the only the store I was at, but everyone that I know who's left Publix says they would never go back and I feel the same. The only good parts about Publix are the Employee Stock Plan, the Tuition Reimbursement, and the vacation/sick time benefits of full time employees."
bad,I have learned how hard it is to find good hard working employees. This is a harder job than it looks. I work with a good group of people.
bad,stay away not a good place to work no full time positions underpaid overworked no paid vacations or sick leave low hours  you cant make a living working here this job is for high school  kids.
bad,The only thing that was not great was how management treated me.
bad,"It is not the company that it once was. Long work days, too many chiefs not enough indians. The pay is not nearly what it should be for an employee owned company. When I say employee owned I mean majority shares are owned by the ceos so your opinion means nothing."
bad,"Publix is a very new store to Rome and when it come to management they lacked in every area which caused confusion and job task to not go smoothly like they should in order to enjoy, get things done and make the best of your place of employment. i learned a lot in my position a lot on my own because there wasn't much training and guidance provided. my co-workers were very pleasant to be around and there was always a sense of team work between us. i did enjoy meeting the great people and helping each customer to my full ability and making their shopping experience one to remember."
bad,"a typical day at work would be helping customers,putting product out on shelves,cleaning various machines,dealing with different types of meat and seafood,unloading trucks.i learned about various types of meat and seafood.managment was un-organized and wouldn't work around my schedule."
bad,"Why I've seen so many nice reviews for this place is completely beyond me. Surely, I can't be the only one who feels as if they've sold their soul to fake customer service and power-hungry managers. "
bad,Taught me self respect and how to better serve the customer. Get along with all co-workers.
bad,Its a fun place to work but the managers are not helpful and not encouraging.
bad,"I work in the deli and the management here is really unfair and values production more than their employees. Upper management only encourages this to continue. I've witnessed managers making fun of different employees for disabilities, and been subject to alot of passive aggressive comments from a certain manager when they're in a bad mood and need someone to take it out on. It's incredibly stressful working this job if you have a life outside of it. I'm always asked to stay longer when I can't, and people constantly quit and call out, it's a happy work environment at first, but now I wish I had ran when I had the chance."
bad,This company is good short term! They lead you on to moving up ladder and then try to get rid of you after you spend blood sweat and tears to make a career! Watch out!!
bad,Regularly being scheduled to close and open was not a favorite. Managers are good and sometimes not good all a matter of opinion. Not too happy with treatment of store level associates
bad,"I loved shopping at Publix and the friendliness of the associates. Once I started working there I found that a lot of the managers don’t really care about the customers. The company doesn’t really care about their employees as much as the bottom line or the all mighty “Chain of Command”. The higher you are promoted the less you care about those below you and the less job work/balance you have "
bad,"It’s a Cult, you’ll be trained like a slave in no time! You will sign your life away in blood to this company. They become your family so say goodbye to your real family. Management is a joke and it’s a Rich Man’s game so if you’re not included or playing the same game then it will suck"
bad,"The store managers at store #1140 are awful. Do not go to this store if you have any hopes of advancement in the company. My associates on the other hand are great and fun to work with (most of them anyway). Love working with customers and the fast, busy pace of the deli. Shame the district and store manager have no idea what they are doing. So many people quit because of them, leaving those that stayed to pick up the slack, which is a nightmare when there is a ton of production during the lunch rush. All the benefits for part timers are gone and getting full time here will never happen. But do not worry. They promised me full time twice and worked me over 40 hours a week. No big deal except each time it fell through and they would come up with some lame excuse like ""your a student and will want to leave us eventually anyway."" One of the times they offered me full time they gave it to someone else because they threatened to leave and the deli was so short staffed. I never once complained and continued to help anyway I could. I even ended up doing inventory orders for my department managers but I have nothing to show after almost three years in this dump. I wanted a chance to advance and only took this job because it was the first to take me in with me having not job experience prior. I love training new associates, working with customers, and the rush. But I hate how I have been taken advantage of."
bad,Do not recommend working in the store you get no paid days off or discounts also the pay is unbelievably low and there was co consistent schedule you could work 20 hours a week or 7
bad,"Once employed, I could only work there for about a week because I have celiac disease and it was causing me to get sick with the flour and cross contamination."
bad,"Every day i would come in check orders, deliveries, and sales. I learned how do better bake and decorate, i also learned how to deal with disgruntled customers and employees. I had to deal with a lot of problem solving."
bad,"I'm not sure if it's like this everywhere, but here in VA they are promoting all the wrong people. Amazing workers are being overlooked so they can promote mediocre people who have been with the company longer. Company culture sucks you in, but it's not that great once you've been here a while. Lots of favoritism. I was underpaid for a very long time according to the pay scale, but they refused to give me a raise. Even when I got promoted they did not give me a raise. It took me 9 months to get promoted to a position I had been doing for 4 years with my previous employer, and only 1-2 months for two other associates for the same position with zero experience."
bad,"A typical day in the Customer Service Department is I look at my schedule for the day at the Customer Service Desk.  I will either be bagging, cashiering, or self check out with a 30 minute to a hour break.  I have learned all there is to know about these three duties and I know and love my customers.  We are the busiest store in the Atlantic region and management/corporate make a quite stressful at times.  Our current Customer Service Managers are up for a promotion and they will write you up for anything.  The hardest part of the job is management wants you to square the cart facing the pharmacy while you load up the cart, put 2 hands on the cart, take 2 steps, and 2 statements about taking the groceries with all the customers.  It is really hard to do and shortly you begin to feel like a robot.  I have been there a long time and I know my customers who mostly want to take their groceries out themselves.  The managers just randomly write up people as it is not done consistently across the board.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being outside when the weather is really nice.  I enjoy most being a cashier."
bad,"Management is awful and always micromanaging.  Corporate level offers some perks.  Part time benefits available.  Tough job, must wear apron and suit pants."
bad,The benfits that Publix has to offer is the only good thing about this company. It is full of family promotion or who you know you could work at Publix for 5 years part time and they give a person who knows nothing about your department full time before you. They say they care about their associates yet if you need to call out for a personal matter you are told it is unacceptable and prepare to be over worked and surrounded by negative people.
bad,"All it takes to ruin a great experience working at Publix is having an awful manager to make sure you want to resign. Publix's job culture strongly supports giving you the hours you request that best work for you. If you request specific availability and the manager signs to approve it, they cannot force you to come into work if it does not satisfy that availability."
bad,"Worked like a slave and they say that they will offer great benefits. Here's the thing, they have not hired anybody full time since 2000. That why you always see a new cashier"
bad,"Been here a year now and its been a headache: "
bad,"Food service workers get 15 to 30 minute breaks once, in a day that ranges from 3 hours to 12+ hours. "
bad,"typical day at work includes taking care of customers, ensuring their shopping experience is in fact a pleasure. I have learned that team work makes the dream work."
bad,"Honestly it wasn’t what was wrong with the company, it was what is wrong with the world. You can’t expext people to work so has and then pay them so poorly. And then they get physically ill from it all and then The company punishes the employee"
bad,"At one time, Publix was a fantastic place to work. Now that the Jenkins family is no longer involved in the day to day running of the company things are going downhill quickly. Payroll is being cut, managers and employee's are stressed out and over worked. I came to this company to be management after being management with a different company for 15+ years. After being at Publix for a year, I decided after seeing how the company treats its managers that I did not want to be management. After being there for 4 years, I am back in school earning my degree to get out this company. The district managers are basically tyrants. They walk around doing there visits and seem to make things up as they go. There are not set standards for anything that I've seen so far. Training and human resources at a store level are non existent."
bad,"It wasn't very kind to its workers,treated full time like a promotion when there were people who had been needing it for YEARS. No discounts, except once in a blue moon coupons , oddly strict guidelines not relevant to the 21st century"
bad,"Horrible experience "
bad,I worked so hard here it it never really did much I had letter from customers and changed operating procedures with new ideas and it never gotbme anywhere careerwise there was blatent favoritism and people who didn't work still got ahead of harder workers
bad,I did not like it here. They treat you as a slave and there is always competition to be better than everyone else. The working hours are not conducive to raising a family. They say that to have full time you must have open availability. When you have kids open availability is not the best option. You don't always get the time off you need and they get angry when you get sick. They block out time during holidays making it impossible to go on vacation. For the amount of hustle and bustle with customers and the complaints they pay is terrible. This job is only good for someone still in school or doesn't have a young family.
bad,this job would be a lot better if managers weren't as strict on you and micro managed everything. employees are great and make publix fun to work while you are there
bad,"Very demanding work, must be organized and able to multi task.  All departments were under staffed and employees weren't given their 5 cent raises upon their reviews."
bad,I just did not like the people that I worked with. I had a job before where when I went to work I would get in 10 to 12 hours a day. But at Publix working part time they would call me in to work just two hours at a time which I did not like.
bad,"At first it was okay, between pushing buggies all day and bagging its very tiring. Management makes a true difference and ours went from great to terrible."
bad,Publix is becoming more and more governed by corporate. The customers are rewarded for bad behavior and just have to threaten corporate and they can leave with something in hand. The wage growth is incredibly slow and unfair.
bad,"I worked for Publix for 2 years in hopes of getting promoted into management. I transferred to 3 different stores and never saw an ounce of hope of a promotion. Working for Publix is very political, and the only way to get promoted is if you know someone. It was very discouraging because I wanted to stay with Publix. I would work 45+ hours and was willing to do anything for my managers. "
bad,I wouldn't recommend working there. Managers don't discipline the co workers when not doing the right job. There's not a set schedule. Manager have no clue what they are doing. I been there for 11 years and haven't got full time
bad,"My work experience started off fine, you're trained really well and made sure you feel comfortable to be on your own. With ""open availability"" even as part time, you can be given anywhere from 0 hours a week to over 30. It changes all the time which can be extremely stressful. "
bad,PUBLIX has great benefits and a great place if you want to retire rich! But management could care less about their employees! It's a dog eat dog company and everyone is just trying to advance to the top at any cost! Not to mention their slave hours and mandatory overtime! You're surely to have no life outside of work most of the year!
bad,Shows a lot of favoritism. Don't hire temp in the 90 day period. The hardest part about the job is dealing with cold and heavy lift of ingredients.  Training should be provided in all areas
bad,I have heard plenty of good things from other employees from other Publix supermarkets but that is not the case when talking about the one I worked at. I would suggest that everyone stays clear of the Publix just east of the highway on Bonita Beach rd. Decently friendly employees was the best thing I can say about the job. The managers are some of the worst people I have EVER met in my entire life. They don't care about you whatsoever.
bad,"i always wished of working at publix it was my dream job, fast forward 13 years its trash. i mean publix is a cool joband all but its not for me.good luck"
bad,"Hours were sparse though available for 5 days. Part time workers are not valued as highly as full time, and management talked down to part times workers frequently. Expected to make Publix main priority and management many times did not care about family or school obligations. Efficiency was lacking and job was extremely repetitive and boring. People boast about Publix being easy to move up in, which is slightly untrue. You must suck up and give up everything other than Publix if you want to go into management and are required to work 50-60 hours a week if wanting to move up. The work you do (in the bakery) compared to starting pay is subpar and not worth it in my opinion. Worked there for almost 3 years and dreaded most of my time there."
bad,"A typical day for me started at 5PM every night. I was always put on the night shift for some reason even when my available hours were set at any time. I would come in and from 5PM-8PM I would bag groceries, use the cash register, help customers to their cars, bring carts back inside, and assist customers with any questions. From 8PM-10PM I would start my chores for the evening. Usually I was put on restroom duty. I would go into the bathrooms, clean the toilets, wipe down mirrors, load toilet paper rolls and paper towel rolls, load soap dispenser, empty the trash, sweep the floor, and mop the floor. After all of the bathrooms were taken care of, I would head upstairs into the employee lounge and clean off the tables, load paper towels, sweep, and mop the floor. Other nights I would take out the trash from the entire store, dust mop the whole store, and vacuum all the rugs in the store. From 10PM-11PM I would help out where ever needed. After closing I was responsible for running the floor machine. After I was done I would meet up with the rest of the customer service team and we would level the entire store."
bad,"Publix is a great place to shop. It is not a great place to work. They may start to treat you nice at first, but once they think you won't or can't go anywhere, they will do whatever they want with you. I know people who get harassed by other workers and nothing happens because that person is a favorite. My store has lost 12 of its grocery workers in less than one year, 5 of which had been with Publix anywhere from 4-7 years. There is also no real opportunities here. I was told I would get hours. Turns out they won't make anyone full-time, except their favorites. I worked here for 2 years and I finally get a $0.25 raise. Guess what? They also won't train me for the position I want and keep avoiding me. They have recently hired about 7 people who have not worked for Publix before for the job I want. They don't train you for anything because they want you to fail. They will evaluate you however they feel like because that's more convenient. If you are sick and need FMLA, they will act like they don't receive your special notes. They will try and schedule you on Sunday and tell you you have to work, when they know that they can't schedule you on a day that you are not available specially if you stated that it is for religious reasons. They will discriminate for whatever reason. They will stand and laugh in circles instead of work. When it comes back that not everything was worked out, all the blame is put on the workers, usually the non-favorites, because they cannot take any accountability. If you are a non-favorite and something happens and the management should technically have"
bad,"Great for single employes.  Detrimental to family.  Publix is a right to work company, be worn that much responsibility falls on associates.  Communication is limited which makes for a difficult work environment.  Accountability for management is almost non existent making it hard to believe in Publix's open door policy."
bad,In the beginning it was great because it was my first job but as I got older I just got burned out after being there for 12 years. The company overall is good but I just could not do it anymore. I was not getting full time or advancing so I left.
bad,"I got along with my managers, I did have some guidance from one my managers to guide through certain things, she always looked out for me"
bad,"Typical day at Publix includes management not knowing how to do their jobs, overall it wasn't a horrible experience, but if the management is bad, it's like prison, if the management is a good, then it's amazing."
bad,I go in and get to leave the department i'm suppose to do to go help other people finish there job.The managers are cocky and seem unrealistic.They try to get me to do everyone's else job.
bad,Typical day of dealing with high school kids who didn't want to do their job. I learned absolutely nothing. Management with the exception of my Assistant Grocery Manager were incompetent and made unrealistic demands. Hardest part of the job was doing other peoples job including my own on a daily basis. Most enjoyable part was leaving.
bad,"I worked at the Harbor Point Publix in Vero Beach, FL.  Their slogan may be ""Where Shopping is a Pleasure"" but working there is not a pleasure. They may give above-average customer satisfaction, but it's not what people say it is when you work there. "
bad,Too much work for too little pay. No advancement unless you kiss butt for a living. Co-workers where okay when they weren't actively trying to get you fired so they can move up in your stead.
bad,"Great on the job learning, growth opportunity available. There is usually an opportunity for cross training which helps the store as a whole."
bad,"Publix has been said to be a great company to work for, however, after five years I have learned this was not the case. Benefits are good and the associates are very friendly. Management is terrible. They treat their associates with no respect whatsoever. Hardworking associates are overlooked and taken advantage of. Managers can get away with whatever they want."
bad,"the day to day at my job its easy but when you talk the people who take the decisions they have preference with small group of people, and should be equal, and the big management don't do  anything about it."
bad,"Its a good company to for for, but not the most fair. You start off as part time with the goal in mind to get a full time position, but there is a waiting list and also allot of favoritism. Some coworkers are great to work with and of course like any other job, there are people who do not want to work at all so you have to pick up the slack. You have just tolerate the other associates. I love my customers, talking to new people and seeing how their day is going, even if they are in bad mood. The hardest part if the job is working your butt of knowing for something knowing you are not going to get it."
bad,"This is a prosperous company, offering stability, but be prepared to be treated like a machine. A very replaceable machine."
bad,"Overall I would not recommend Publix because of the way employees are treated. I was treated quite unfairly just because of my age. I'm constantly looked down on and my coworkers always assume I don't know what I'm doing, although I can do a lot of the work better than some of them. A typical day would consist of helping customers non stop, and doing other work for my co workers.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the lunch rush when there's a lot of people waiting, it can get very stressful at times. The best part is coming into work and seeing all your favorite co workers are working and all of the customers are walking away with a smile on their face. That is when you know you've done your job right. "
bad,"A typical day would be cashiering, customer service staff, bagging, shifting around wherever I was needed."
bad,"Publix focuses very heavily on customer happiness and giving back to the community, both are very great things. Management can be back biting, and sometimes play favorites among employees which can cause tension. The benefits & pay are amazing"
bad,They don't listen to the employees only the customers  I know the saying customers are always Right and the customers know it  so some of them lie on the employees to get Free food the get employees fired ssssomethingsthat's
bad,"Needs to hire competent managers and work better with employees,also stop favoritism and find out the whole truth with all situations.also do better with employees valuations."
bad,"Just cause you have sick time don’t mean they will not let u go (ask questions)  about everything do research (keep track of Incidents)"
bad,"Pros"
bad,"Working at Publix, you care 110% about the customers and 0% about yourself. There is much verbal abuse that gets delivered from customer to worker, and we are simply supposed to smile and brush it off, with no ""Team Management"" to help us through it. "
bad,It's hit or miss with your district supervisors. I suffered through the bad and excelled with the good. Very customer focused company but typical retail struggles balancing enough help to cover workload.
bad,"You can go from a decent 30 hours or so, to a single day week.  Depends on how business is.  It's embarrassing.  If you want to cross-train, it helps, but still.   They sell you a bill of goods of why it's good to work there. "
bad,"Publix has decent benefits. The investment opportunities they offer are some of the best investments to own in any industry. Publix stock. But, the pay sucks, the inconsistent schedule, a lot of Publix managers don’t know how to talk to their employees respectfully. Not all. Work scheduling and life balance is horrible balance is horrible!"
bad,"In my department, we are always short of people, not so much help with upper management (store level), Need more practice on their accountability. Hardest about the job is they pay minimum wage no matter what your experience is. Most enjoyable part is, the flexibility"
bad,I loved my job and my customers but my manager was extremely lazy. She continuously pushed more of her responsibilities on me since I 'was set on getting full time' but never actually gave me full time. She never listened and had her own clique she would talk to.
bad,the biggest problem was communication. the managers would collaborate on what they did leaving holes in knowledge. training was minimal at best but you're already expected to know everything even if its your first real job.
bad,Really hard to get promoted. Have to have full availability and wont keep full time as a parent because you have to have open availability. Part timers one week will have 30 hrs to 15 the mext. Very unstable
bad,"I had a wonderful experience in Charlotte with this company and the managers there. When I moved to Wilmington, everything went downhill. The management is not helpful, they are very rude and backstabbing, and they also seem to conspire against people who they dislike."
bad,"Most employees were in a bad mood in the department I worked in.  They had a negative attitude.  The management were either not skilled in their job, or spent their time doing thing unrelated to the department."
bad,"During a typical day at work, I tend to attempt to get what I need to get done at my own pace, in order to not mess up or to prevent hazardous risks onto myself because I can be known to be a little clumsy, if not careful. My manager will call me into their office and threaten me about what they don't want to see while I am working, however I am only doing my job and going the extra mile, which is ALMOST a requirement for them. There is something I do not completely understand about Publix, even if it is a place to provide premiere customer service. Why is it that, when I ask someone, on my own accord, to take them to their car and to assist them with their groceries, that I get into trouble about ASKING the customer to help them. Isn't ASKING someone to help supposed to be the POLITE thing to do, under sociable matters? Not at Publix, apparently."
bad,This would be tough for permanent job for long run but it is good for sessional to add extra cash in the bank. Since after January every part timer got almost nothing to work at all. May on request to store manager can help a bit but it is all right
bad,Working at the deli at Publix is beyond insanity.  The position is extremely stressful and lacks appropriately trained staff and does not provide enough staff to keep up with the high demand.  The immediate managers are constantly belittled by higher ups and either cannot keep up with their own work load or do the bare minimum for thier position.  Many of the associates either did not know how to do their job properly or were incredibly lazy and got away with being lazy.  I would highly advise keeping away from the deli.  I got a herniated disk from the amount of stress and physical labor required to do the tasks at hand.
bad,I would say if you just want to kill your self every day for nothing and always be tired then this is the job for you . If your a man then you'll go far no matter age or experience women on other hand good luck.
bad,its a great company as far as benefits and such but long hours. work life balance is not there. its Publix or nothing. no time off during holidays. no contestant schedule.
bad,"Publix has great benefits, but they don't wanna pay employees well, they're cutting now all the benefits, rude and racist store managers, their schedule is crazy. They use people more than anything else..."
bad,"I love decorating cakes,  everyday isn’t the same , unloading the frozen food truck every Tuesday, Friday and Sunday . Some mangers will make you punch back in when you punch out ."
bad,I feel like it’s needs more times with workers and explaining the value of the company. I love the benefits and how the try to include the workers. But sometimes the company feels like you’re suppose to be there regardless and are  always ready to try to fire your or write you up for things you can’t control.
bad,Should not be in the Forbes top 500 Companies to work for. Company routinely cuts benefits and hours for front line workers. Management is focused only on keeping the consumer happy and could care less about the associates.
bad,They don’t give you any hours no matter how many times you ask. They don’t listen to there employees and some of them are hateful and they want to give you a time limit in the bathroom.
bad,"Overall, if you keep your head down and don't get to close to the people who work beside you, then it's fine. At the very least, have a real life outside of Publix. I spent seven years at Publix with little issue, but eighth year, one of the favorites decided I vexed her. Three suspensions later, I quit."
bad,"Publix was a good place to start working, competitive hours as part time, doesn't matter if you follow instructions or not, if the manager doesn't want you anymore because of new people. They just ignored your work efforts, and give all the hours to whoever they like."
bad,The company has changed over the 5 years I’ve been there. Employees are quitting left and right and management is changing hands on a monthly basis. No longer a employee driven company. They took away all bonuses and the moral of the company is falling.
bad,"Its true that publix is a pleasure to shop but to work is a whole other story. Managment is constantly coming down on employees for things not included in job title, understanding that is partly for standards theres no reason a person in chef selection should be meeted about sales of lack there of in chef selections. Publix taught me a lot about customer service and cleanliness yet also gave a lot of stress. Before i had transfered stores i had intentions of sticking with the company in the alanta division yet in the charlotte divison one couldnt pay me enough to. This isnt meant to be a shot at the company itself more less this division."
bad,"Too many people in charge and no one communicates so the others don't know what is really going on. On the outside everyone seems friendly and happy to be there but if you actually get to know a worker and talk to them, its the exact opposite. No one really wants to help you move up. They are more likely going to step on you to better themselves"
bad,"Publix is constantly Changing. Most times it is not for the betterment of the associates. Publix tries to be the best supermarket, so it creates a level of stress for the associates. They, now, promote managers that are not ready for the position but are constantly losing the managers that were. No one seems to be finding out why good managers are leaving."
bad,"Its Okay, not bad but they can do better at managing hours and workloads. Specially if your closing the store. Still good for a job to get you started."
bad,One manager over the store harassed multiple workers had to file a harassment claim the other managers were awesome and did amazing job but the one manager did his best to run the ones he didn't hire out
bad,"The oasis system makes Publix a non Personal place to work. I remember the company when it was one of the best places to work and advance.Now the only way to advance is to bluff or be a backstabber. If you want to be a manager you have to be able to give your best non full time workers 10 or so when they are not needed it makes it hard for the most loyal worker to be loyal,and the nicest person to give customer service."
bad,"If you life to work this is the place for you. They want you to live for the company. It's not a bad company, they just expect you to put the company before your family."
bad,low paying job. They evaluate your work performance every year and give on average a $0.25/hr raise. There is constant pressure to be always friendly and a hard worker. You NEVER get a holiday off. The benefits are good but they hardly compensate for the low wages.
bad,Lots of gossip and favorites with my the mangers and customer service staff. I enjoyed working here until I was treated poorly by the managers and want to leave immediately.
bad,"Working at Publix is great for a student or social people. You get to really connect and meet new people, which is the best part of the job. The worst part of the job for me is, no set schedule and working weekends. I learned how to be social and engage more with people enhancing my communication skills."
bad,"Ok place to work, but they want blood sweat tears and then some to move up. team environment is awesome, management in departments is nice, but Goals are further away then in most retailers"
bad,Very hard work for very little pay and very strict working environment. Management is usually very inexperienced and you're often left on your own to figure out your job. Crude working environment.
bad,"Publix is a great place to shop, but not to work. The management expects certain people to work their tails off for the job so they could advance to management as well - to the point that they disregard any injuries at work or home-life needs. As a part-time employee, you will be treated like a peon, but you hear so much about how Publix is great. You'll probably have co-workers call out day in and day out but if you call out once you'll get in trouble for it and probably even fired for ""abandoning your job"". "
bad,"I worked for this company from March 2011 to May 2014. At first management was outstanding. They changed managers so many times while i worked there, i honestly could not keep up. About the last month i worked for this company, i was getting 3 hours a week. Their go to excuse with not getting hours is the scheduling system Oasis they use,"
bad,"They try to work with your schedule. I've been there for three years now. I've accomplished four raises. I hardly get many hours there, so I'm looking for a job where I can get more hours."
bad,You have great people to be around. They are always family orentied. Store is always clean and make sure to have the best of food out for their customers.
bad,The Company started with a great policy with employees in mind. Management treated employees with dignity and respect. As the years went by and the economy shifted and lawsuits occurred the company changed from being employee focused to only customer focused. The simple statement of keeping employees happy and they will treat the customer very well left the company lacking and also promoting managers with no people skills and making them numbers driven kept the staff from being motivated. It became just another place to work.
bad,Typical day can be stressful with many various tasks that almost seem impossible to complete. Most valuable experience earned was customer service.
bad,"Normally the day starts off with checking the department of close to or out dated products, and over ripe fruits and vegetables. Publix Produce departments receives a truck daily for new inventory and stock. Associates unload the truck and then break down pallets to restock items from the day before. Next comes maintaining department and helping customers for remainder of the day."
bad,Publix is an okay place to work. Its good for young kids to start off working. Compensation could be more fair. Benefits are good. Lunch breaks and bathroom breaks could be longer for the amount of time you have to stand during work.
bad,publix is a great company as a whole but sadly the store i work at it is not so great its hard to move up when there is a lot of favoritism going on
bad,I enjoyed working here when I had a certain manager but when he got transferred it went downhill with the new manager. it just dependes on what management you have like I love the store manager but my grocery manager isn't great at all.
bad,"working at publix can be fun and stress full at the same time. fellow coworkers will try to undermined other employees to try and move ahead of them, often hire racist employees that move on into management positions. the best part in working for the company would be the benefits. would not recommend anyone for working at Publix"
bad,"Publix overall was an above average job. Pay was fair, hours were there just it was difficult to get coverage if needed to call out."
bad,It was just a job to pay the bills. I learned a lot of useful skills.  The managers there were not the friendliest or the most skillfull people there. Some of the cowarkers were a joy to work with.
bad,"Okay, i read these reviews all the time and always assume that the people that write them are just the lazy ones who don't want to work. Now i understand that is definitely not the case. I've worked for Publix  for about a month now and i am physically and mentally drained. I despise my job as a deli clerk. The other employees are all selfish jerks who only look out for themselves and when asked a simple question, they act like it's the most difficult thing in life to answer. I thought that because i had no other responsibilities that I'd be scheduled mostly during the day. No, all I've done so far is close. Closing freaking sucks when your new. No one tells you what to do, they just throw you on the floor and assume you'll get it eventually. I have a medical condition in both of my knees and doing most of the work in my deli is very difficult and strenuous on my knees. I've asked to be moved to another department that i believe wouldn't be so hard on my body and i keep getting the same annoying answer, ""we're working on it"". If you want a job that is flexible, enjoyable, and actually works with you DO NOT apply at Publix. Shopping may be a pleasure but working definitely is not."
bad,"The job itself would have been really great if the management knew what they were doing, and if people who could and actually wanted to work were hired. None of those things are true for the publix i worked for so all-in-all it was a terrible work environment."
bad,"Ive worked there for about a year and cut my hours down to 3 hrs a week,if u are a overnight bagging, please expect to clean rugs and the whole store while getting yelled at for something a coworker didn't do"
bad,Publix it’s really nice because of the pay but the pay is the only thing I like I hate the people I work with my managers are crazy hours are crazy I went a whole month working one day a week now I’m working everyday a week and even on my day offs they still call me. Like can I get a break man if I was to recommend someone to work in Publix I would say yes but your in for an rude awakening
bad,Employee benefits. Part-time don't receive bonus money. Part-time employees receive some stock shares. of company. Part-time employees receive vacation time-off.
bad,While at publix one of my coworkers had a incident where a man spit on her in the parking lot. My manager then apologized to the man and told my coworker to get back to work
bad,"I enjoyed working at Publix, the friendships I made there will be kept in me forever and I will continue to keep those bonds. I was very unhappy with management unfortunately."
bad,"In retail there's always something to do and always more work than people. publix pays well and has alot to offer but your work is never done here, you can move up quickly"
bad,Most of the day consists of either bagging groceries or walking into the parking lot to bring in carts. if you were to start a conversation with a cashier a manager would be sure to remind you of the one cart in the parking lot.
bad,"Worked for Publix for a year great company but, don't agree with certain policies. One is about vacation repayment upon leaving or dismissed. Also injured on the job which should have created precautionary adjustments but, that never took place. So the liability of it happening again is high very high."
bad,"I was a dept mgr for 5 years and any time a member of “leadership” (dm, rd,vp) came in to walk the store they were rarely appreciative of the hard work and many hours away from your family you’ve dedicated to Publix. I was even considered an “exceeds expectations” management and was treated like a filthy dog by my District Manager for as long as I worked for him. The “good ole boy systemic alive and well at Publix."
bad,"never wanted to promote, always get different managers and have to start over from the bottom , pay is not enough for what we do like clean all the nasty things women leave in the rest room"
bad,The workers are lazy and nobody ever gets in trouble for slacking off. People make up excuses for not being able to work certain shifts but still get more hours than people who are able to work whenever.
bad,I worked there for 17 years I’m not sure what it is I’m supposed to say about this company I no longer work there. I don’t think it is fair for me to have to feel this questionnaire out.
bad,"The one thing I hate about Publix is even though you have 18 years experience in management they start you from the bottom like you can afford to take a 35,000 pay cut and be happy about that because the company is a great company to work for. I love everything about the company but how they hire management with experience. I went from managing a entire store to stocking groceries on grocery crew a waste of talent. As a company they need to do better than that."
bad,"Decent company to work for."
bad,"Providing premier customer service, including greeting them and responding to questions"
bad,"great benefits for employer's, loves there customers . very picky. I love working on busy days there was something to do all the time . its never a stand still job."
bad,Im a supervisor at publix. it is a very interesting place to work you see all types of people and all types of situations. its the policy of the company what makes the work environment difficult. the customer is always right and we always give away everything.
bad,The management didn't care about the people below them. The other workers were great. Flexible scheduling. I learned accountability: if you are taking someone's shift then you have to follow through with it. Hardest part of the job was the older customers who were rude.
bad,"When closing every night, employees are more concerned about leaving than doing an accurate job, especially washing dishes; always running out of product or supplies; some employees are difficult to get along with, employee moral is low and employees call out on a regular basis."
bad,I was not getting enough hours at publix but also the environment is very cut-throat. i would not recommend  someone to work there. Also the CEO is slowly but surely getting rid of all the benefits that publix is known for.
bad,"Started at a new store in a new district.  Clearly the culture they preach, and the culture you the live is very different.  Treat customers best, and have the cleanest stores, but that's where the difference ends.  Also wages are going up across the board, so their ""competitive"" pay is no longer competitive.  I'm not sure where all this ""best place to work"" stuff is coming from."
bad,"The job is very repetitive and can be quite depressing. The customers a lot of the time are HUGE jerks or are WAY too needy (this coming from a nice person, It takes a bit for me to consider you TOO needy in a customer service environment). You also constantly get co-workers that are so pitiful that you constantly have to pick up their slack. This job has AMAZING job security, which is actually partially a TERRIBLE thing due to the TERRIBLE workers never getting fired, but instead just getting a slight smack on the wrist every time. So, you continue to pick up their slack until they quit or transfer."
bad,"Job is good with working around your school schedule and whatever else you have going on in your life.  You get a raise every 6 months, but it is only 25 cents.  Con about this company is the management since it is easy to become a manager and it is given to the wrong people."
bad,"Publix has the potential to be an excellent work environment.  However, the shift in the culture has made working at the stores difficult to stomach.  The company structures everything around fear.  Fear the next guy in the chain because they could walk and rip you to shreds.  There isn't a manager I know currently that is happy with their job at Publix.  The company demands perfection but will not allow you enough hours to achieve that goal.  That being said, there are few companies out there that allow you to work your way up to the amount of money they can pay without the need for a college education.  It is not an easy job, it requires large amounts of personal life sacrifice.  Also, if you are working in the Lakeland division there are very long waits for management positions."
bad,Publix is a great company to work for as far as benefits. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers have a great shopping experience. The managers and employees there are all very professional and helpful.
bad,"Working there used to be fun before it went from family to corporate. They do not care about their employees, only the bottom line. the only plus side is that they are very flexible with your work schedule."
bad,"At this store you always start like a bagger,collecting carts,cleaning,bagging......"
bad,They work you too hard for the pay. They promise you a big juicy steak dinner but gives you a hotdog. The moral here is low and the management are very pushy.
bad,A friendly place to work great benefits.  Worked in a team environment.Greet visitors at community’s front reception desk in a professional and pleasant manner. Receive incoming calls and ensures questions and needs are directed to
bad,"good benefits, poor inventory and product management, lack of space for freight, unsafe conditions, a job that can never be completed"
bad,I wasn't there for long because the team leader decided to try and put me outside in a tropical storm to grab metal shopping carts. Tried scheduling me during class hours when they lacked employers and wrote me up for calling out those days so that I wouldn't miss school.
bad,its a good place to work they focus on customer service which is a plus for me. They make sure they train you and make sure you know their culture.
bad,"A typical day in the Publix deli was never an easy one, but that's what made it enjoyable and worth the hard work. It is a very busy but rewarding job, if managed properly. No matter your shift, you are to help the customer with anything they need to the best of your ability. As deli clerks we formed relationships with returning customers and encouraged new ones to return. That aspect of the job was very satisfying and I learned almost too many things to list."
bad,The most part of the job I enjoyed was talking to different people I learned how to communicate with the people I worked with.
bad,"Always had great customers for life, Management very strict. New rules came along everyday. Hardest part  about this job was when short staffed having to slice meat and prepare subs in a timely manner."
bad,"Very fast pace,high demand of job duties,learned to be a team player and to depend on coworkers to get job done right and efficient.Very stressfull job in the deli,you take on a lot of management job duties.The most enjoyable part of job is working with customers and providing good qaulity product."
bad,"Responsible for customer service, inventory replenishment, on-aisle restocking as needed and price labeling. Provided excellent customer service and developed positive corporate reputation. Solved customer problems and addressed concerns. Helped increase sales and profits by advising and assisting customers on purchasing decisions."
bad,"I would open the store and count down all of the cashiers tills to make sure that they had the correct amount before time of their shift, cash checks, western union, money orders, and assist customers with their merchandise also would count the safe and make deposits to the bank while also putting data into the computer for accuracy I had the upmost respect for my coworkers the hardest part of the job was more work less pay 6.50 an hour"
bad,Starting form the time you clock in and start your day at work it's all about satisfying customers with anything they need. It helps you to learn how to deal with customers in any situation. For example if someone comes in unsatisfied with our product simply refund it and apologize for their time wasted and making sure they leave happy and wanting to come back and shop again. Managers or a big help and great leaders. Seeing to it that the staff or well trained. Co-workers become family after a few weeks of working there. Having to communicate with each other if needing help finding a certain item for a customer and keeping the store in good shape. The hardest part of the job was time management. Not spending to much time on one customer if possible so others will get the help they need as quickly as they can. The part of the day i enjoy the most is making a difference in a customers life by making there day run a little smoother and easier.
bad,"People in the corporate office are stuck up and rude. Procedures are incorrect in most of the manuals throughout the whole company. Management in all aspects in the company from distribution, grocery and corporate seem to have no idea what's going on. Health insurance for the family is ridiculously expensive."
bad,Its a job but if you can learn from the right people in the company take there advice because it can only help you in the long run. Just like any job you have good people who really have nothing but good intentions for you then you have people who will hold you back for as long as they can.
bad,As a selector life can be very tiring and all you will do whenever you get off is go to sleep lol. I really pray for those people selecting and wish them nothing but the best.
bad,"Store manager is very rude and doesn’t care about his employees, i have a ton of stories from multiple people about how bad he is. I worked there bad in 2014-17 so maybe he has changed but he’s still there."
bad,"At first I was really excited about the job but noticed my coworkers weren't as happy as I was, only took about three months for me to realize why. The management was laughable at best (of course there were exceptions AKA assistant managers) and the idea that if you weren't the best of the best you won't get hours is really dooming. I worked harder than others but was put to the side for others that were just around longer. My employees however were the best coworkers I could ever have (exception of two). Daily we would be first thing organizing shelves, stock shelves while we wait for the trucks to arrive, unload and sometimes reload, organize again and final shove of sale items. Most of the time though we always ran out of popular sale items and had an overload of non popular sale items."
bad,"This is a great place to work. Benefits etc.  They do have a hard time with understanding personal life. They can do better for their employees. You work hard and you do too much work for one"
bad,"Unless you're looking to make a career out of it, or need a first job to obtain some handy skills, I don't recommend Publix for the long-term. You will not be graded fairly on your evaluations and have an ever-changing set of managers that makes it hard to form a relationship with them. Also, don't expect to move up in the company if you aren't buddy-buddy with your managers. They constantly play favorites and will give you the short end of the stick if you don't brown-nose them. Corporate constantly makes changes that do not translate to real-life applications, therefore providing a jarring disconnect between associates and higher-ups."
bad,"My typical work day at Publix consisted of many different jobs within the produce dept. I learned how to cut fruit, and become a part of a very large work group.  The pay is low but the job is a secure one."
bad,"It’s different at every store but majority of the managers are lazy, they show more favor to a certain group of people, including giving them the hours they want, whether it’s less or more that THEY want. They don’t listen to any of your problems nor do they care as long as it doesn’t effect you coming in. I would say if you wanna work here work mornings or evenings."
bad,"Publix has very nice pay and benefits. But to me, the hours were not worth it. Time goes by so slow at the job, and at least where I worked the managers and employees were very snappy and selfish. Management could be better."
bad,"The company sucks for anyone that believes that through hard work and being resourceful, your leading to the path to success."
bad,"It started out as a good job, but it had no guarantee of moving forward. It all depended on the manager’s opinion of you, not of your work ethic. The stress of working in a popular deli with a small staff can make even the shortest shift dreadful. Also, the policy of excellent costumer service is often overstepped by greedy or rude customers. I felt like I wasn’t treated as an equal."
bad,"Publix is a decent place to work, however my location made me despise every day I clocked in. Customers were awful and often treated the deli associates like they weren't human beings. Many times simply having to wait 10 minutes on chicken would cause the customers to yell at us regardless on if we were cooking or simply slicing meat."
bad,It s ok good people was nice work was ok this need more hour s did not have a place to work in different department I got to experience a whole lot different departments how to order things how to measure a different weights of the seafood had fun putting out produce any new products especially the Jewish ones different Meats in the deli department and how to weigh meat how to put out different Meats in the meat department
bad,"Corporate management not conducive to good work place atmosphere."
bad,"I LOVED my job here at publix and I knew more than one department, but I was getting less than 4 hours a day and it got to a point where I had a four hour shift with only one day of work! That's not right! I worked there for 5 years and I didn't get full time or more pay. So I had enough and quit."
bad,Publix is a fine company to work for although if you plan on making a career of it I would advise working as a full or part time associate. Management is very strenuous on family and relationships. You will move up quickly if you don't mind traveling and I do mean traveling. I had to drive over a hour one way for 4 years once I got promoted. So its really up to you because its a good growing company that is owned by the workers. Not easy but worth the effort if you're looking for a good start on a career without advanced college education. Just keep your options open and learn all you can while you're there because you can work anywhere after you've worked for a while at a company like Publix.
bad,"Depending on the staff scheduled, I could work as a customer service clerk or a cashier. If the front was understaffed, then I would work as a cashier. That is one of the major reasons to why I left the company as well."
bad,I think I was treated unfarly because I had a accident at publix the doctor gave me ok to work light duty publix refused then fired me after 28 years of service
bad,Pay is horrible for positions below management. It is impossible to live off of your own with the salary provided unless you are management. They make up the horrible pay by giving you stock but you only benefit if you work there for many years. It is possible to retire as millionaire. But you basically have to give your whole life to publix. I mean at least 30 plus years of service. Other than that it's not bad unless you work at a store  with not enough associates or just bad managers.
bad,This was not the job or environment for me. I needed a job for the summer and this was okay but I never enjoyed myself or felt passionate about being a cashier.
bad,"Deli Clerk and Cashier"
bad,"Pay was great, there were no benefits for pt employees and you could not get enough hours to make ends meet. Would not recommend this job to someone whos trying to get back,on their feet!"
bad,There are several jobs to do at Publix. There is no lmit to what career you choose. It is easy to shuffle from Job to Job within the company. Just get your foot in the The door
bad,I had a prior 2 years experience in cashiering at Harris Teeter and they hired me as a bagger which was more of a janitor. 0/10 would not recommend this place.
bad,"There is extreme favoritism working for this company. I was constantly bullied, along with many of the other associates in my department, by my manager. A lot of the department managers are incompetent, but since they had been there forever, nothing was ever done about their behavior. I have insanely good customer service skills and every product I ever produced was up to standard, yet I was constantly targeted for personal reasons and not for my actual work performance."
bad,Overall publix is well organized company and has good business associates. Publix knows how to treat their associates. Publix gives good benefits.My time working with Publix is joyful
bad,Between favoritism and the constant drama that happened I found it hard to enjoy my time working for this supposedly amazing company. Don't get me wrong I had some amazing co-workers but I constantly felt like I'd been thrown back into High School almost every day. Also sucking up to the managers seemed to be the only way to get a decent pay raise or even good hours.
bad,"Management is changed every 6 months to a year so you never really get to develop any relationship with management. There is no proper training for a majority of the tasks given. The saving grace of the job is the coworkers, there was never a problem between associates."
bad,"The management, in my opinion, is something they definitely need to improve on. The managers there are pretty nice for the most part, but expect you to do a 2-3 person job by yourself, due to the short handedness of staff. This, seems to be the biggest problem that I have encountered. Ever since both, my grocery manager and my assistant grocery manager has left to another Publix location, I have been experiencing poor management with my new assistant grocery manager."
bad,Publix is a good place to work part time for high school or college students. The pay is low and there is little change of advancement. Raises can be as low as five cents. No kidding. Public stock has dropped in recent years. Public expects 3 times the work from you at 1/3 the price. Public full of nepotism...family members get priority go for raises and promotions. Dead end job
bad,"My manager liked to micromanage everything I did, every customer I helped, and loaf I bagged. I attempted to switch departments but I resigned instead"
bad,"Not able to get enough hours, however a great place to work. I enjoyed interacting with the customers and learning new things. The employees were nice."
bad,"Publix was my first job. Going in, I expected to have few hours because I was part-time, but instead, I was given full time hours and being played for part-time."
bad,"A great place for a first job, with lots of room to improve your standing within the company, including stock options and regular raise opportunities."
bad,I enjoyed my job at Publix Pharmacy and was really upset when I was administratively resigned due to not working in 30 days because of my school schedule.
bad,Good job for a teenager still in highschool. If you are okay with revolving your whole life around your job then you will like it. Managers do not take enough responsibility for their departments
bad,"fast paced high stress this job will end up consuming your life . it has its good and bad days , just as any other job would . People are kind hearted there"
bad,Working here seems like a good idea I am a very cool and humble person.Me working here can show the costumers love and appreciation and also respect and kindness.
bad,it is an alright place to work in. it all depends on the area of which the store is located in and also the people that work in the store. it is a good starter job.
bad,Very hard work with streneous work space and the limited hours cause the staff to always be short and people are always waiting to pick up their medications
bad,"Publix has always been a good  company to work for, but the last few years have changed slightly. A typical day at work used to be fairly good productive, but once management changed things began to go downhill. In other words, being satisfied while working for the company solely depends on which store a person is working at."
bad,For the most part the job is pretty boring. Usually you're busy doing something so theres really no time to interact. The job isnt too bad just be ready to be alone for the most part.
bad,I didn't really like it very well and the store wasn't run that well other than the main manager but I rarely saw him because he walked around and talked to everyone.
bad,Good  job to work if looking for a long lasting career in and a good retirement plan etc though something  part time say if  your in school  might not be the job for you
bad,It's an okay place to work. Not too fond of management. my co- workers are super cool. im okay with the grocery bakery and deli managers as well as seafood and my customer service manager other than that i dont care too much for it
bad,Working at Publix was a wonderful experience. The company .It was fair to all workers. Management kept us informed as to upgrades in all areas. We learned team work and how to treat customers in a way that they wanted to return to our stores. The hardest part of the job was closing at night so the morning crew could open with ease. I think the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing how customers were satisfied and would return over and over.
bad,"A Typical day at work included a bunch of standing around, assisting customers, and more standing around."
bad,"This job is very rewarding only for long term commitment. The company doesn't fire anyone. Even if your not the best worker? They are satisfied with that but they wont promote you. I just hung on for awhile til I got a better understanding and how how to go about what I really want to do."
bad,"This is a great company to work for as an hourly associate. The benefits and opportunity to advance are definitely there. Lazy people need not apply, as productivity is constantly pushed and labor is trimmed to the bare minimum. Most managers are competent, but there are a lot of promotions to maintain the correct quotas. This hurts many stores, but these are the times that we live in. Managers are basically required to live there; scheduled at least 50 hours a week and very rarely leave on time. Upper management likes to make last minute ""rules"" during busier weeks concerning managers schedules. Often times, this results in working until midnight and back at 5am. You can make a good living with this company, but be prepared to put work before everything else. If you have kids, don't ever let them be sick or have any relatives pass away and need to miss work to handle personal issues; you will surely pay the price upon return. The phrase ""you're salary, nobody cares if you go home..."" is used quite a bit now. The upper management has really changed the culture of this company in the past few years, its very unfortunate."
bad,"Rotation of stock,stocking shelves,maintaining all areas clean,,learned alot about produce items,,management was ok,just had to many managers in time I worked there,co-workers were nice people,,unloading truck was the hardest part and meeting good people was most enjoyable"
bad,"The cart pushing wasn't bad at all, it was rather fun to be out in the sun. The people were really nice and the customer service was up to par. Just too much strain on an injury I sustained while working there."
bad,"For most part this was a great comoany to work for . They have advancement ,  great benefits an on job CDL.trainibg . But after  almost 13 years Publix in Dacula they  decided to put my husband back in warehouse from being a trucker causing his pay to cut in half . ONLY  because he went 3 miles over  for more then 5 mins. It was ridiculous.  I have it in writing for the  reason . I did not believe it until I read it . So  he left an moved on to better opportunities ."
bad,publix is a wonder place to work but the pay isnt well ive learned alot of patient
bad,"I have learned how to deal with many different personalities, understand peoples needs. Sometimes I toke risk to prove my motive to make customers come back and to understand that the point to Giving is to show the love we have inside ourselves. And besides I hate when some one is hungry or in need cause it bothers me. And being defiant towards others and all still end up being my mistake but I know that we are built to make mistakes and learn from our mistakes to make us better than we were. But as for me I know I was a STUNNA. That means a risk taker and made Publix their money."
bad,Managers at Publix do not act professional with their employees. They do not know how to set schedules right. The best part about working there was the customers.
bad,"The data entry position I was hired to do was on the back burner, I ended up being a box stacker most of the day. I hurt myself in the process and workers compensation was not granted because I was accused of faking."
bad,Weird schedule b.c. i was a minor and could only work so many hrs. Learned how to bag grocery and learned how to work the register .How to count money.The hardest part was dealing with people all day.
bad,"My typical day was assisting my customer's which was great. You tend to see the same people day to day & become very attached to them & their families. My co-workers were great, we all got along pretty well & that made the atmosphere nice. The hardest part of my job was ever changing management...we could never seem to have any consistancy when it came to our management staff."
bad,i was a bager i approved help with item and keep the store clean
bad,NO opportunity for advancement unless you know someone in Upper management
bad,This was the best job I could have ever had until they started switching managers.  Once Mr. Ed retired the job was not about being a family any more it was more about making money.
bad,good place to work benefits amazing people even better management depending on which one you work at will determine if you have a enjoyable time or not i was a victim of retaliation publix does do that there a good company on the outside but some of the stores are very sneaky
bad,"Publix CAN be a good place to work depending on your manager and your store. I moved from a central Florida store to a brand new NC store and wow, the difference is insane. In Florida everyone is chill and it was a super good work environment that made you feel like you were cared for as the employee apart from few bad managers or team leaders. But now in NC, the store I’m at has several good managers but also several brand new managers that still don’t know how to properly handle things. I am expected to devote my life to Publix or just quit. There is no in between. And because the expectations are naturally so high, if you are reaching expectations, there is no reward. And let me tell you, Publix expectations are ridiculous. Yes, it makes for a great store, but it is very much so at the expense of the employees. Good people are abused and bad people are encouraged to do better. There’s really no winning and you’re never good enough. I also have people at the same job class as me that have been working for Publix for months whereas I have years at the company and they decide to tell me what to do and sarcastically correct me. I started crying like a child to my team Leader and CS manager yesterday because of how poorly I’ve been treated since this store opened. I miss my FL store so much. Everyone in the northern states, I realize there is more competition, but ya’ll need to chill the heck out. It’s retail, not life and death. "
bad,Management is horrible because they pick favorites and these are real people and not what you see on the commercials. You have to be dependable but not too much because they will keep you in the same position as long as they could.
bad,"I was a part-time employee at Publix who was trying to develop a full-time career with them. My management teams were often unwilling to listen to my desires to advance, and usually only wrote in my performance evaluations whenever I did something they didn't like or asked for help on something they didn't know how to help me do. On the pro's side I did get to learn how to work in all of the different departments and made a lot of great friends at several different stores close to my primary location. The training process is not structured very well for specialty jobs which is part of what made it hard to advance."
bad,I loved working for Publix. It's just changed in the wrong ways nowadays. I just want something new now. They just couldn't keep up with the changes in society. It's definitely a wonderful job to start with.
bad,"I did not enjoy working at Publix- you worked whenever they scheduled you whether it would work with your schedule or hours or not. You would experience random hours cut, longer shifts than you are available to work, and no regulations on working late and then having to come in the next morning. Even though they offered stocks, PTO and other benefits for the full-time employees (mainly managers- others were not really hired on full-time), part-time employees got robbed of a lot of those assets. They used to reward employees with free lunch vouchers whenever a customer gave a guest a compliment but corporate stopped giving those out, too, because they were ""giving away too many"". You received no store discounts or perks for being an employee there- it was just something to pay the bills. "
bad,Being a cashier was so interesting. You have the chance to talk and meet people all day. The customers enjoyed your smile and patience with them.   You could not but help this kind of interaction with the public in so many ways.  Managers were always very kind and considerate of their employees.
bad,It's a good job it's just the management wasn't fair and the employees were filled with drama. There was a lot of favoritism going and problems among the staff. And the pay wasn't good but the benefits were good.
bad,"Lots of growth within the company. Managers all started in the company as a bagger, cashier, deli clerk, etc.. They provide health insurance, dental , 401k for full time workers or after you work a certain number of hours within the company."
bad,I liked my job for the most part. I just did not appreciate the disrespect for management and people get  catered  too more than another. It's a unfair place.
bad,"A typical work day in grocery dept at publix was get assigned to your isles, check sales items and look for them in back then fill them, truck arrives help team unload truck with pallet jacks, break down truck stack u boats, bring them to isles and stock shelves rotating as you do and facing and blocking nearby items as you work product, fill shelves, stack back room, stack and remove pallets, separate  sales items, refill sale items, block isles. While working at Publix I learned attention to detail and anticipating the customers needs, being friendly to every customer and addressing every customer. Management was hard to communicate to, not very friendly, co-workers were friendly for the most part. Hardest part of the job was the speed they wanted you to work and the bad communication in produce department. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, everyone had a good addatude."
bad,"My job at Publix was short lived. I had to work the register, have good communication skills. I had to make sure customers were satisfied with my service. I enjoyed meeting new people but the management was horrible. They would change my shift without calling to notify me. I would say the hardest part about that job I was biting my tongue a lot. I got along with a few of my co-workers."
bad,"This job had it's good and bad. More good than bad tho. I loved the work, just didn't like how I was being treated by management."
bad,"good benefits and pay but at least at the store I worked at the management gave off the impression they felt like they were being punished for being posted at that store. also if you ask about a procedure or something of the like you get answers like your young you'll learn one day, or if department/person a did their tasks correctly then what would you have to do when you came in"
bad,"I came to work accurately and on time, good organization at the workplace, work is very fast and fruitful,friendly staff, we work together, friendly  customers, everyone is happy with my work."
bad,"Customers are very difficult, impatient and unfriendly Training is minimal before they throw you to the wolves. This was the worst job I ever had and I am a 55 year old retiree that worked took on this part-time for extra cash. It was horrible. No perks unless you work a certain amount of hour and those perks are minimal. Frankly, I hated every minute. I quit because I will struggle until I find something. This job made made me hate people."
bad,"One of my typical days at work are normally busy and interesting. I always meet different people and get to learn something that i didn't know as each day goes by. i love working , i love people , i'm extremely friendly and respectful."
bad,"Typically you come to work and bag all day and when you are prompted most likely you will continue to bag every day and grab carts, clean, bend down to customers every need, do go backs. I've learned a lot but nothing I was supposed to learn within a work environment. The hardest part of the job is putting your feelings, passions, and human rights aside for others. The most enjoyable part of the day is closing."
bad,"It’s decent whenever everybody works "
bad,I wasn't happy at Publix. I'm a little older and had to keep pace with 20 year olds. 6 hour shifts with no breaks. Not even a 15 min break. Back breaking work.
bad,Publix is a great company at what they do and offer. After working there for only 6 months I made it clear that I would never work at a grocery store never again. Pay is decent yet scanning items and repeating the same lines over and over sometimes even nonstop for hours on end gets to you even only after a few months. I guess I could say the same for all grocery stores but I am willing to admit that Publix would be the better option
bad,"Was a nice place to work, with the benefits like the stocks given to you for every 25 hours worked, but unless you plan on retiring from Publix, its not the place to be. You're just a number in their corporate world and will not think twice on getting rid of you."
bad,"days can be stressful, customers are always number one even though they're hard to cooperate sometimes overall it was a fine work experience and would recommend for younger people."
bad,Great Company to work for ....benefits alone were fantastic...hardest part of the job was working nights and weekends...not much family time and my family is very important to me.
bad,The hardest part of it all are the random scheduling. The work/life balance is not good. Money is great though.
bad,"After a year you get an automatic stock if you have worked the required hours needed to get the stock."
bad,"publix was a cool place to work if you had no responsibility, however my issue with publix is it's you vs the customer even if you are in the right and follow company policy they just dont care and there is a bunch of SUPER shady stuff that goes on behind closed doors that customers are not aware of however i have been told it is the location buuuuut i worked at 2 dif publix and they were both pretty terible"
bad,I enjoyed my time at Publix. It was a great environment to succeed. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the back room.
bad,I enjoyed being treated fairly. Great place to work. I really enjoyed this experience. They treat you like Family here. They are a well organize and clean company.
bad,I learned to be an all around player. I get along with everyone.
bad,"I was a front service clerk , it was okay but Publix does not give you a lot of hours. If you full time they make you work long hours but if you part time you will be working 2 days out of the week. Reasons why I had left. The customer service always acted like they were the managers and telling folks what they can and cannot do. I hated the them."
bad,"The hours you receive at publix are the largest draw back, they have so many employees hours are scarce, i averaged between 11&15 a week, good for high school students or retired people"
bad,"Workplace is miserable and the managers were very annoying, their rules there are kind of strict. They have good benefits and is worth staying if your store is any different from mine."
bad,"I am now having a bad experience @ Publix, Greensprings. The management needs to be under construction. It is a wonderful company to work for, benefit wise."
bad,Good place to work if you are paying for school or retired. They also have good benefits and work around your schedule outside of work.
bad,awesome place. awesome pay awesome people. My first job and I love it. Long hours good pay. Management could use a little more help at times but they are Awesome
good,The gunny was a good morning I just left my work. I’m gonna is the season to come pick. I just want a little to go with you guys tomorrow and we could do a little extra. I just want you know what
good,My Most Enjoyable part of the job is When I help a customer to find a item and we look for item together and it was for good dates for his wife and He was very Happy about it
good,I worked part time with no disciplinary issues with in the store. My hours were cut after receiving a pay increase and was passed over repeatedly for opportunities for advancement to younger workers. I was forced to work in a department that was one of the hardest departments in the store to be able to receive hours. You had to be nominated by a management team member to move up in that department. Not your typical promotional process were you apply for a position with others and are interviewed. I loved what I was doing but could not deal with the inconsistencies.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people. There were a lot of complaints about management from customers. The hours were constantly being cut.
good,Very enjoyable co-workers and management.
good,"I felt like I was working for children, my first job ever but my training for cashiering was only one day. I was given one day to learn everything than shamed for messing up and asking for help when needed. The assistant manager for customer service was very rude to me, even my main mangers it felt like there main goal was to make me feel stupid they were no help and unprofessional."
good,"During my tenure at publix the co workers were very hard to work with whether they're young or old.  I also relied on a consistent work week of about 35 hours but would occasionally experience a steep decrease in my hours, going down to anywhere between 4 to 15 hours give or take for a couple of weeks."
good,Cant advance with out getting full time and getting that is close to impossible. They tell you it's not who you know but what you know to move forward. That is correct but only after you get full time. To get that it is who you know and not what.
good,I was harassed by the store manager all the time even though I was doing what I was supposed to do. My hours got cut because I wouldn't kiss up to the store manager. I had worked there for over a year barely making it to bakery associate. When another person came they have her the title of cake decorator within a month. I was constantly talk down to by my subordinates. They are all fake to the customers. I will never work for them again.
good,Would not recommend this company.  Publix would not let employees move up to full-time until after 3years of working. Management would not help their employees and could not answer questions.
good,"No stability, don't know what hours you'll have from week to week.  Never paid the bills  Can't make plans or appointments due to an ever-changing shift.  The manager had favourites and the rest of us were left to fend for ourselves. Most the other employees I could hardly understand as English was a 2ed language.  The young employees were seemingly against the older employees.  It may be good if you have another income, but not if you are head of household with only one job."
good,"people are favored, others like myself worked my butt off and got no recognition, "
good,"Clocking in, Customer Service, Boxing donuts, labeling and putting them on floor, pilling rts, labeling and putting on floor, pulling 10am bread, customer service, keeping floor stocked, making sure all cases all full, making sure the floor is full. cleaning, washing and sanitizing pans and dishes."
good,"The management at Publix is terrible. They are too strict with everything that they do. There are no employee perks at all, we're lucky that we get somewhat of a decent paycheck!"
good,"I would recommend any high school age or young early 20's person to work there.  I wouldn't recommend it for anyone wanting a career.  They had me there for 6 years, and never made me full time.  After I left, they took away all my stock options available to me, and told me I didn't qualify for them.  I was only part time with no benefits, and they worked me 46.5 hours my last week with them.  I would recommend for a part time child, but not for an adult."
good,"Publix is a great company to work for. Personally, however, with a terrible manager the experience is ruined. Me and my coworkers are often left to fend for ourselves in situations where our experience doesn’t meet what’s required for the task. The pay is great but with nearly a year between raises and promotions it’s very difficult to advance ."
good,"Management needs work, sometimes its a ok place to work and other times its not. It seems like your personal life gets put on hold to work there. I like getting the bonus every month."
good,This company under pays everyone that comes into that job except management. You are working 10 hours a day at 8$ making as little as 250$ a week. The management does not like to help you advance. They ignore you and they hire from outside even when you qualify. i would say this company is a horrible place to work for.
good,"Cook, clean, and unload"
good,"It use to be employee friendly... they are on the downward spiral as all corporations get to when they look at profits over employee ... take care of the employee and he will take care of the customer, AND MAKE MORE PROFIT than when you start cutting spending...   1st mistake is workers get promoted into a position of incompetency ,,, 2nd mistake is they don't fir the first mistake"
good,"Years of working with this company and yet still being treated unfairly with hours! It's NOT based on experience, but how well they like you! How they determine your hours week to week!"
good,"My experience with Publix started off very well. My only problem at first were the hours. I, along with others, would be given no more than 10 hours a week. Most of the time, we would help other departments just to make up time so we could get paid. Sometimes, I would receive 2-5 hours a week. Throughout time, no matter how much I would ask for more hours, I wouldn't be given hours. Publix did not care that I lived 20 minutes away and they would call me in to work for others 30 minutes before time. It seemed as if I didn't do the extra work, I would've been punished with less hours; that's exactly what would happen. If I had not filled in for another call out, my next weeks hours or the week after, would be nonexistent. I've also been treated very poorly by certain members. Going into high school, I did not see that the very little hours and pay were such a big deal but as I started to receive my own bills, I realized that I couldn't feed myself or live off of the $30-$50 a week that I was given. Between the unfair treatment, poor hours and pay, I thought I would be better off leaving. I would not recommend working at the Pawleys Publix if you're going for Customer Service. Other departments and managers are very good, Customer Service is not."
good,Depending on the manager of your department can be very joyful at times but with certain managers your time can be very uncomfortable.  if you get into a certain Department and take that job because it's available when you applied it is very difficult to be switched to another department. Once they have you in the deli they never let you go.
good,"If you don’t know anyone or are related to someone in management, or are a cake decorator or butcher, then you’re chances of becoming full time are nil.  If a front end supervisor has a bad day or wants to be spiteful you can get as few as 10 hours a week from 25 or 30.  Retail keeps people off balance by scheduling them opening one day and closing the next - unless you’re in with management or the job requires only graveyard, the schedules are all over the place.  There’s no sense of community because management gets reassigned and no one knows your value.  Front end cashiers can be very catty (men as well) and they take their frustrations out on other employees rather than to management where their issues belong."
good,"Publix is a ok place to work. Not so much a friendly environment or a family. Publix shows too much favoritism to certain employees causing a reflection of hours but blams it on the system of oasis. I use to love the company. Also employees are filthy expecting other to clean behind then and no one steps (Management) to do anything about it , then when its time for an inspection everyone is going crazy with the cleaning. Its like this because the produce manger is unsanitary. Well monkey see monkey do!"
good,"Managers here play favorites and seem to not care for your advancement or career in general, several times i asked different managers for a full time position in any department, they say ""they will look into it"" but never get back to you."
good,I would take cake orders from customers on a daily bases. Also would pack the bread and rolls. Also I would make sure that the shels were fully stocked.
good,"After 5 years of employment it was all that was necessary to see that the focus of the company is not what they portray to the general public. The founder realized the backbone of the company is the employee. The current management focus is a dispensable and cheap labor source that is available. They promote no layoffs, but refrain and avoid the figures on the turnover rate. When hired the company allows no consideration for family time and your work schedule changes every week with very little notice. This is NOT a career option. For additional income or part time work for a ""little"" extra cash, yes. When you disagree with the company, they will berate you. Constructive criticism and change is not welcomed at any stage. You basically sign your life away when you work full time at Publix. They use the employees as a tool and will avoid giving anyone full time status at every turn. Past work history and education is not considered. This really needs to be looked at for what it is-a simple retail place to work while you continue your education or use it for a little spare cash. There is a saying among the employees- ""I work here, but I can't afford to shop here."" Family time for married employees is difficult to impossible to maintain."
good,"Under the Miami Facility Services department of Publix there is a clear and ever present level of bias and unequal treatment of employees who don't ""fall in line"" with their treatment of others. If you're not in the boys club, good luck with any real advancement in this department."
good,They are like kroger and they don't care about their employees as they been there for a while They may pay a little better but they don't give any kind of concern about their employees
good,They say working at Publix is a pleasure in some cases maybe. But the time I had at my store was a direct result of management with to many chiefs not enough Indians
good,"Here it goes, after hearing that summary you think I may be a lazy worker.  The reality is that Publix had a lot of prospects for job growth.  You could buy stock in the company and increase your paycheck to a living wage.  If I worked there now like I did back then, I would of taken advantage of the stock buying.  Since it was my first job and I didn't know better, I can't say for certain if it's a good fit."
good,"cutting deli meats, cooking, waiting on customers, making trays, and answering phones"
good,"team meeting"
good,Learned from management how to balance the store and also supervisor duties.
good,Publix may be aggressively taking advantage of the pharmacist oversupply situation by overworking current pharmacist and systematically firing older high salaried pharmacist
good,Always aiming just to pass the next inspection. Managers rotated constantly. Managers made many inappropriate comments and picked favorites. Held back raises due to manager inability.
good,Publix cashier was alright it was easy I would work on Tuesdays Thursdays and fridays and I always was doing my job because it was not that hard after I learned how to do it
good,Not a great place. No advancement no full time changes management to often. That's I would love to move to a better more stable company. It's ok for a kid in school bit not for people needing to pay Bill's
good,When you leave they won't pay you your earned vacation time even with a notice. I can see why people walk out and not come back.. management has a tendency to yell and shout at you if things not going good.. lied about staying pay and when questioned ask you if you got it in writing. To cliqueish
good,"Great place to start out working, but not somewhere you’d want to stay for an extended period of time. No discounts, worked almost full-time house each week. But got no full-time benefits."
good,"Hard work, doesn't matter how strong you may think you are. Constantly running. Job pays based on performance but if you aren't fast enough or accurate enough then you will be terminated. The management and corporate offices are always making it harder to meet goal, which lowers the performance pay.  Basically you don't make as much because every so often management and corporate make new rules and changes which prevent even the top performers from reaching the same levels that were previously possible. The company works 24/7 which is good money, but you hardly ever get any time off for yourself.. Everyone is almost always tired, stressed, and having mood swings. It sounds good when they are trying to hire you but come on over to Publix distribution and see for yourself, lol"
good,"If you are part time you get no benefits. Managers are book smart but lack people skills. If you work in the deli prepare to be over worked. They give no overtime, even though your department may lack coverage. Odd for a company that is suppose to provide premier customer service. Publix claims they have “competitive wages” but often times the managers are told to try their best to give employees as little as possible on their evaluations. Publix consistently hires new people above what tenured associates make. This is a good company to work for but do not let them fool you when they say they are not like the competition."
good,"Discrimination on age and wage evaluation's "
good,no  i do mot want to do this no info   not enjoying  no more  make subs and cut meat  work place  work place no more  i have learned  a lot this is enough no more
good,"I worked in the bakery, and it was stressful. If you couldn't learn and keep up fast enough, you would be kicked out of the department. I was there for a year and I liked it for the most part. But for me, it got old fast."
good,This was my first time working for that staffing agency. I just think it can be a better system so people can keep there job. Going off how they work and perform and work with people.
good,"A typical day at Publix Supermarkets is really stressful and sometimes its really tiring, and the management is not that great. The customers are the best in the store because they brighten up your day. The workplace atmosphere is not that great all time because beforei walk in the door i need to pray and listen to my gospel so i can have a wonderful day."
good,Is a great place to work depending on the management staff that you may fall under and depending on the race you may be or  what  hi appointed friend you may have .
good,hours are very low. Not up to cost of living. Want all employees to be the same even if you are uncomfortable with something. Summers you do not get enough hours to live.
good,"Pay is alright if you're in college, but if you're trying to support a family it's very difficult. Schedules are never set, they change from week to week."
good,Management didn't have a good culture. They would not set a good example for there employees. The coworkers were good people. The work was pretty easy.
good,"the managemnt is HORRIBLE . you can work here for years but the bottom line is if youre not in the popular clique you will NEVER advance , unless youre the worlds best butt kisser. If they dnt like you or you call out they will cut your hours to 5 a week ."
good,Very moving. Sometimes high paced and quick learning environment. Raises are hard to come around and minimum recognition for hard work. No more than 35 hours a week.
good,"It was an okay job for the first year and a half. After that, it got dull, new management always coming in and out, no job advancements. Its an okay job IF you are in college or high school. Other than that, PLEASE keep looking elsewhere."
good,It was tough to work but no family time hard to have a life outside of work bc you work such long and early hours. Very demanding on the body and mind
good,Great hours but everyone i worked with was so up tight and the atmosphere wasn't very pleasant........................................................
good,Just like any other grocery store use you till you can’t or won’t be used anymore. They tell you full time is an opportunity but what they don’t say is if your among the few that get special privilege than you can pick your full time schedule otherwise you have to work with dealers choice. As a part time they promise 20 hours when you get there but there are people getting ten
good,The management of this company is very biased and favor specific people. And God forbid you have some sort of tragedy because they couldn't care less.
good,Company itself is great. Management sucks. They hire anyone who is willing to become their robot and basically control. Company itself has great benefits and also a diverse group of co-workers. Sometimes they try and give you that you are the company speech but in the same breath tell you everything your doing wrong.
good,I worked there just to support my son the management was hard to work with some of the employees too the customers were not always the easiest to serve and help
good,Did not get enough hours.  I enjoyed meeting people I worked in the aprons department and as a cashier but advancement was very difficult and hours per week were very low
good,worked all the time and no time with family even though the company supposedly value family time. management is hypocritical and two-faced they say one thing to your face and do something else behind your back
good,"Publix is great, if you're an older person. But for the teenagers and young adults they employ, it's one of the worst places. I fully believe it might just have been the store/managers and not every Publix is the same but it's still pretty bad."
good,"The management at the store that I worked at was very belittling, if you were not part of their favorite group then you got the worst cleaning jobs and got treated the worst. The cashiers and other staff worked like a family, and the customers were wonderful."
good,Good place to work as long as you have proper managers. Policy could definitely use some work and CEO could use a business education lesson. Would work there again as long as the manager treat associates right.
good,"In this company they expect you to be as robotic as possible . All they care about is how many donations you get for them. They play favorites and they make it mission impossible to move up in the company. Doesn't matter how hard you work and how well you preform with one failure, or one bad day they will make you feel miserable for several weeks . The supposed benefits are not that great. You have to work more than 1,000 hours in order to qualify and they take a certain amount of money away from your pay check, especially in the health insurance . It's hardly beneficial at all if you do the math. My overall experience has been a terrible roller coaster ride ."
good,Publix is a great company but some of the employee are not the most agreeable and Tend to clique up and cause vast amounts of drama and provide a bad work environment
good,"Fast pace environment, learned how to organize and control inventory, management is tolerable, workplace has a decent culture, worst part about the job is schedule and most enjoyable is free lunches."
good,"I found that the people were very cold and rude at Publix. They don't properly train people and then cut down on their biyearly reviews on stuff they were never trained in. Also, they will work their people to the ground for days on end and sometimes with no lunch breaks.  all in all it was an awful place to work"
good,"Was promised at least 35 hours a week and only get 20-25."
good,"They no longer care about the individuals working there, just the bottom line they are given. They promote the fastest based on looks, not talent or hard work. Their ROI procedure is no longer effective."
good,There is no typical day at work and that is what I like best.  Ever changing customers and menu options add variety not only for the customer but the employees as well.  I have learned a lot in regards to beer and all the different types from home brew to domestic.  My co-workers for the most part are team oriented and so am I.  The hardest aspect I would have to say is trying to please all the management within a small family owned tavern.
good,co-workers and management very hostile..salary very low. no overtime but you have to work extra hours anyway.....benefits are minimum
good,"Working for Publix  as a part time deli employee without advancement for 4 year, is the problem with a lot of associates with the company now. Managers play favors with friends and family look over hard workers that's there everyday on time. The company blames the economy for lack of full time hires. Part timers with no benefits, no straight pay some employee has been with the company for 7, 8 years part time. Person with a family to provide for its hard working for Publix. Positive points stock option retile bonuses 401k etc. part timers doesn't receive the same as full times."
good,I have very little room for advancement. They expect for me to have no outside interests. The work hours are impractical. I think the company culture has degraded greatly in the last few years.
good,typical: avg
good,"What was once a family friendly, company who supported and encouraged associates, is one that is now more interested in dollars, than people. They no longer hire full time. Management is condescending and often dangle the more hours/ full time carrot before people who work for years without promotion. Getting promoted at Publix is all about who you know. Are your Parents Publix managers? Then you'll surely rocket to the top. "
good,"The hardest part of the job was pushing the carts because it doesn’t matter if it was hot or cold we still had to go outside and sometimes my back would hurt, but the good things of that job was I got to see happy people coming to shop and employees enjoying customers time"
good,I enjoyed working at Publix only because it was close to home. Benefits are only great if you are considered to be management. It could pay a little more.
good,Was promised multiple promotions and still have yet to get a promotion after being there for almost two years. Degrading place to work for. poor management.
good,Don't recommend it a lot of the employees are miserable. People come and go the only ones that stay are the older employees who have no choice. Work somewhere where they appreciate you.
good,"Fast paced , not enough time for daily production, they expect too much product done perfect  with the time provided and the resources..... sometimes not enough help to fill orders !!!!!"
good,"Hard to advance, pay is awful, would recommend if you are in high school not the job for an adult. Management does not know what they are doing and does not care."
good,Constantly being short staffed at job and required to work way past time scheduled to go home. I did enjoy the people I work with. The hardest part of this job is losing associates but still being required to maintain standards
good,I liked working here but they never gave me enough hours and kept hiring people that wasn't qualified.  They didn't offer pay raises and the hours would drop below 20 hrs a week so I had to find alternative employment so I could pay my bills.
good,Not a job to rely on for a living because hours are inconsistent.  Can't get enough hours to qualify for benefits and health insurance. Management is unreliable.
good,"Management does not care about individuals, they do not coach, they point out errors instead of leading. If you are sick and call  out they are very difficult to talk to will make you feel like you should come in regardless of situation."
good,"I loved being a baker at Publix, but the management was terrible. When my coworker who was doing 70 hours a week as a part-timer requested full-time status, she was told that they couldn't justify it when the department was failing. I worked similar hours as a part-timer. When a full-time slot opened up, they hired a new person and gave it to them even though I had been there a year and worked hard for that position."
good,"Publix can be a great play to work depending on your personality and ability to deal with slackers and rude coworkers. The managers couldn't care less about you, especially the store mangers and assistant department managers."
good,"Still in love with the company, great customer service experience. Publix it's the perfect place to understand Customer care philosophy. I learnt a lot from this company customer care."
good,"It varies depending on your manager, but I just happened to get a manager that was very demanding. I didn't feel like I had a life outside of my job.."
good,"Hectic and  Unorganized"
good,They need to stop worrying about money and improve the treatment for their employees. You can't  have a life while working for Publix they will call you to come in even when you're away on vacation
good,"Great Company !!!! Very Bad coworkers :("
good,"The store manager that I had never wanted to work with me it always seem like he was against me. The shifts were inconsistent and everything was always done 50/50 never 100% effort, if you want to move up in a company like this. Rub up to the one in charge or else you're getting paid terribly"
good,"Publix like most has changed so much since the family is no longer involved. Publix was founded on the customer service basis, and well now the Bottom line is the only matter they now have. Pulbix is a great place if not in management. I enjoyed my 30 yr term, but wanted to try something different."
good,"I don't really have much to say in regard to Publix. It's a good store for it's customers, and anything to do with my experience does not reflect how I think the stores are in general."
good,This is a place to work and retire without any advancements on career growth with new technologies and strategies. No culture and no professional ethics. Poor management that pass on pressures unnecessarily to the team members.
good,"Nice place to work .fellow associates are friendly to all customers...the department management lack people skills and are generly rude to employees and customers with few exceptions ...I loved working at publix ,i had a good relationship with my customers."
good,As I said before this is better for college students. Most of the management only look out for themselves. you dont get a discount because your work there. they say they give stock but i was part time. so i didn't benefit from the stock
good,"Lack of training kept me in the position that I held for over a year and a half. Continully went to management asking for additional training, and they brushed it off to the side. Felt they where happy with my performance at the position I had, and did not want to train someone else for that position. "
good,"great place to work, very flexible with hours for school. Many different departments to transfer to. Many opportunities to advance in many different departments."
good,"To much favoriteism, I am a little women had 5 healthy men in room had to all heavey . attenduce policy sucked never knew when getting off.worked during hurricans"
good,"Very busy at times, but it can be relaxed. There's long hours and you will be there late sometimes and have to be right back very early in the morning. Depending on the position you have, I would recommend."
good,"Publix is very dedicated to shoving an ideal culture into your thoughts. We are told how great Publix is. There is no balance between your work life and home. Scheduling is always sporadic and you are never guaranteed any requests off, seeing as how they can change them at any time."
good,"Although Publix is a huge and great company to work for progression is one of the hardest things to do in this company, it takes years to be able to move anywhere or make any sort of mark, after the first time you mess up you will be cut of hours"
good,"I loved work at Publix but if you do not have a good personal relationship with your DM your job is going to be unappreciated, your job turns from fun to a nightmare. My DM criticized my job for five years, never be happy , never OK . Until one day I said I'm done ."
good,"Busy days. Learned how to make/bake bread rolls. Not crazy about management. Culture is good, the employees are nice. Time management is hard. Giving the customers quality products."
good,"The work was to mundane. i learned to grade produce and  get to know decent people who shop there but that was it! Management at the store i was at  in Oakleaf  in west Jacksonville  Florida was not the best.My co workers and customers are what i missed the most!"
good,"The management at my location was immature at best.  They felt that the fear tactic would be the best to control their workers, saying things like, ""oh i can write you up for that..."" or, ""it's better than no job at all...at least you have a job."""
good,"If you have a bad manager, you're going to have a bad time. If you have a great manager, it's one of the best experiences around. Management switches every year to two years."
good,Took the test to be promoted to management and was denied based on a personality test and not the skills I possessed. My manager suggested I take the test but did not approve me for advancement. Managers are difficult to work with. Be ready to work ridiculous hours with no 10 hour grace period that is required.
good,"The store manager was personal, but the others seem to be in a power struggle with lots of disagreements. Publix employees do what outside services should be doing and at minimum wage."
good,"The management is really what defines your individual experience. If you have a great team it helps tremendously, incompetence slows everyone down."
good,Overall this job was ok I worked there as a warehouse person for one year the pay was ok but average management treat the selectors with more respect then other workers the only good thing about this company was the free lunch and my awesome coworkers benefits were also great but not better then some jobs my coworkers were all good people it was just like another job you work 12 hours a day four days a week then clock out nothing special and not some place for a long term career.. But  if you like cleaning dirty bathroom toilets mopping in freezing cold and fearing that you'll get fired then go right for it
good,"I was raised that if you can't say something nice don't say anything so I'll just say it was not my thing although the benefits were decent for a retail company. Some love working for Publix, but most don't."
good,horrible job you get no hours and the pay is terrible. The company is great far as benefits but you will never move up in the company far as full time or a btte position
good,"Its a good starter job for high school students but its not a career."
good,"work was extremely busy, and not enough workers to balance the work load, leaving pharmacist stressed as well as the 2 other technicians, Publix needs to know that they are way to busy for only 4 people to be running it, and that is including the pharmacist who literally had never had a break in her career, having to eat lunch beside her computer and continue working at all times."
good,"Ticketmaster sales, Money order sales, Western Union transactions, Check cashing, giving out daily tasks to cashiers and baggers, Balancing office and registers daily and nightly."
good,"4am -1pm"
good,company had made many promises to company and employees but never lived up to them. very little growth potential.
good,I quite that joy when i got injerd on the job They had me come back to work the day i was to come back but when i called to get my time cause they refuse to get a sedrual they refused to answer the phone and then told me i was to open and i was a no call no show so i went in and told them i quit
good,"Wasn't that great. Managers wasn't that awesome, could have been a lot better."
good,"Most days were repetitive, alot of unorthodox questions, and managers breathing down your neck left and right. Dealing with customer complaints. Even when you thought things were ok, they really were not."
good,"The managers suck! All they care about is product going on the doors, by any means necessary. The company makes you come to work sick because they dont accept doctors or hospital excuses. If you dont get FMLA your screwed. A food manufacturing plant that has people with viruses and even the flu walking around because they will lose their job if they miss work. Unacceptable!!!"
good,They dont care much about employees having time with family. Not a good place to work with little kids. Doesnt allow full amount of grievance days when family member passes.
good,This was my first job and I was excluded by all staff for being LGBT. They would constantly try and correct anything they could about me and made the whole experience very uncomfortable and spread rumors half the time. I was 14. Not a good welcoming experience to the job world.
good,Finding out that I was lied to about benefits and lied to about being hired as a full time employee and then found out from another employee how to look that up and I was only a part time employee which meant I will not be getting the benefits that I wanted the job for in the 1st place.
good,"I was really excited to work for this company after my interview. It's very fast paced & extremely hard work, which is something that I'm used to. The great thing about this company is, you get paid every week! Grocery is the worst department to work because women work harder than the men! I was constantly disrespected & I left at the best time! The store manager is a MONSTER! Do not work at this location in Macon. You will regret it, especially in the Grocery dept."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced and hectic. What I learned is if you want a full time spot, then you are only gonna get it if the manager likes you. If not well then this is in fact a dead end job."
good,"If your a single person or full time wage earner then this probably ISN'T the company for you ESPECIALLY if you're over the age of 35!!!!! While your co-workers, can and, usually are fun the work environment can be stressful depending on which department you are in."
good,"Publix says they are a ""family"" but will run a manager out if they don't like them. Higher ups work with bare minimum personnel but want everything to be done so their productivity looks good on paper so they can get a bigger bonus. Bonus was taken away from associates. Only available for managers"
good,My experience was OK management was not too good Never got enough hours lack of care for there employees a day at work was always busy noting to new it’s publix
good,I did not enjoy working at the location I was at. I did not get along with the pharmacy manager. I also did not like the pharmacy computer system. I had a hard time telling if prescriptions were ready or not.
good,It’s ok I really miss my old boss that I started with. She cared and was there for her works the manager we have now is good she gets the job done but it’s just her attitude that I really don’t appreciate.
good,Work hours vary every week. Management is constantly changing . Benifits are good once you become eligible for them. Unless you become full time it is not a dependable pay check
good,"Typical day at work is following orders, not directions. If you can do more they will always task you with more until you burn out. They don't teach you much, other than no matter what the customer is right, and no matter what you are always wrong. The hardest part of the job is the lack of constructive criticism, they tell you but don't show you their expectations and this is withheld from you until your review- the ONLY time you will receive feedback."
good,Come in do my morning routine put down mats greet customers ask them did they find everything they were looking for and if they didn’t I would go out my way in helping them find it
good,"I have shopped at this particular Publix (#802, on Venice Island, Fl.) for about 30 yrs.  I have always enjoyed their product lines, attention to detail, friendly folks & services.  I am now on Social Security and am a former 40 yr. Mgt. Professional, though Not in Retail.  Their Severe Corp. presence is very intrusive and is exemplified by Mgt. advancement based upon the # of years of service and not on excellent mgt. principals or skills.  Their Top mgt. (in 2 stores now) is largely incompetent!  Their middle mgt. is even worse!  It's based upon those same ""get ahead"" goals.  I have met few who have any ""People Skills"" whatsoever.  There are rarely any, ""Please"" or ""Thank Yous"", from these inexperienced trial mgt. wannabes.  This results in low employee morale and a lot of turn over., especially of more experienced personnel.  These ""know it all"", know nothings, are all about intimidation to accomplish Corporate set goals.  Teens are best suited to working at Publix as they also know nothing and are not smart enough yet to know when they are being taken advantage of.  I believe that this is a deliberate Publix Corp. Policy!  As a 40 yr. former Professional Mgr. myself, with experience in 6 figure budgets, 40+ employees, scheduling, logistics, Time and Money mgt., and putting out daily fires, I have a real appreciation that attending to your employees needs is essential to get the Job Done.  These skills are lacking in the very structures built into the Publix philosophy.  I am simply now a retired PT cashier to supplement my SS.  I am being told how to do my job by avaricious"
good,"I learned how to cut meat"
good,It was good to get a paycheck every Thursday.  But the reason I left was because they only have part time positions (that way Publix doesn't have to pay any benefits)
good,"I wouldn't hire someone who worked in a Publix deli for another food handling position. The training was subpar for health code and industry standards."
good,It’s has good job security but you will sit in a position based on what kind of relationship with your manager. If your manager gets involved in your personal life and doesn’t agree with it they won’t promote you.
good,"Great for school students first time employment. Hours are flexible and extra hours are welcoming. Full time, promotions and career advancement is very hard and not built for success"
good,"The Publix I worked at had a female customer service manager and a female assistant manager. I was a male bagger that was ""cross trained"" as a cashier. The managers refused to give me official training as a cashier and they because of that I was doing a cashiers job, but my job title was still bagger. Giving me training as a cashier would have put me in a different pay scale, and it would have given me a chance to be full time. I would not recommend this company to anyone that was a friend of mine. I would however highly recommend this job to someone, if they are into self harm."
good,Its a great company to work for if you plan on going into business school because they will help pay for that. Otherwise they expect you to do management work for part-time pay.
good,"Management easily picks favorites and does not really listen to employees. Not a good place for job advancement, but a good job to learn some life skills and to earn some extra money on the side."
good,"Publix was a fast-paced, consistently busy work environment that will leave you with little energy for a personal life and compensate you minimally. It is not a permanent situation."
good,"While working at Publix you will send a lot of time on your feet. My Publix is a very busy Publix so everyday is different. I have learned about different cultures and ingredients used in the dishes that I prepare. I truely enjoy helping out in other departments, such as Meat, Deli, Produce and Bakery. Helping my coworkers out with their job allows me to learn different things and I really enjoy being a team player. I'd have to say the hardest part of my job is the low pay, lack of benifits (unless you are fulltime, which is very hard to get) and working holidays instead of spending time with my family. The most enjoyable part of my job would be helping my customers master the art of cooking, especially cooking steak. I also enjoy the interpersonal interaction I have with my regular customers. They make me laugh and I hope I make them at least smile."
good,I worked for publix for over ten years in total. It was a great place to work when I started but the longer i worked there the worse it got. If you have good management then your ok . You have to work every weekend. The pay sucks unless your a manager.
good,The job would have and was really good until the new management came and ruined the working experience of everyone that the manager was in charge of for his section of the store.
good,"Training style is very lose, your coworkers teach you a lot even if they haven't been there much longer than you.  Benefits are great if you can make it to a year. Not much to day about management."
good,"I was promised at least 30 hours per week at Publix as a Cashier. So far it has been 2 weeks, and they gave me only 14 hours the first week, and now 10 hours the 2nd week. Is this a joke?? I'm an adult woman with a family to take care of, a car payment, and a mortgage to pay. I left another job to come to Publix because I believed in them.  I'm very upset.  I don't think they really care about their employees.  I asked for more hours and they keep telling me I will get more hours, and I don't.  I thought this was a good company to work for.  And then to top it off, instead of scheduling me say 7 hours, 4 or 5 days a week - they schedule me 2 very long  days per week. They scheduled me 9 hours of standing on my feet and to come in only 2 days during a Sunday and 1 day during the week. It's ridiculous! I'm so mad!!! :(  I should have stayed at Winn Dixie where I was getting at least 32 hours a week and normal days per week."
good,Publix was but wasn't a fast paced workplace..it was more like a relaxed fast paced if that makes sense. The pay is every week but what is the point in having a weekly paycheck when they don't even want to schedule you to work for two weeks and you have bills that need to be paid.
good,It’s better than Walmart but not by much. Hard to get full time. No vacation or sick days for part time. To get “free” stock you have to work a lot of hours.
good,"management was just okay, specific managers really do care, though. hours can be rather tiresome if you close, and then are made to open the next morning."
good,The company was great overall but they had poor management the manager would talk to you any kind of way and disrespect you in front of costumers they show favoritism
good,Publix is not the great company you think it is. there is no advancement when you have to work whatever hours they tell you.It was really hard to advance.
good,Aprons cook 3-4 days a week which was enjoyable but the strict uniform policy and daily cleaning were awful.
good,"Publix culture is good although no every manager adapt to this. I strongly believe that an employee can keep his job based on the management style; if your manager doesn't care about his employees then his employees won't do anything for him and won't care neither. I would say Publix is a good place for young people with no responsibilities of a family, who go to college. The shifts are very inconsistent, 24 hours previous to your shift you schedule may change and you are left with the question what kind of life if this if you have kids and have other responsibilities and need to go to Doc appointments? we see things when we are out of it but it is something different when you are in, so be careful and be patient when looking for a job!"
good,Not a productive job at all. The pay is horrible. It doesnt match the work. The hours are very inconsistent. The turnaround rate is pretty high. I just dont think its worth working there. Not one person i met liked working there.
good,Management was a waste. Uniforms were insanely strict. They wanted you to dedicate your life to publix and the environment was kind of toxic. Not that great.
good,"One has to be able to lift heavy objects. The hours are long and tend to be very early or very late. Other employees were nice and friendly atmosphere. Direct manager was a bit unorganized, but general manager was great."
good,Good for young people and sell outs not good for mid age people to many rules that conflict with and against one another love my teams hated the stressful environment of the upper head office!
good,It is a great place to begin at then to transfer to another store. The management there is not what it needs to be. The hours need to be set and not flexible for school students.
good,"If it's not an issue with a customer, it's drama with other employees. Most have never grown out of their high school mentality and still think they're the popular kid on the block. New employees are also given priority over seasoned employees when it comes to hours. Also, if you're not on friendly terms with your manager, good luck having a good time working here."
good,You start at 4am and fill out your forklift check sheet and start pulling product from racks following your computer screen on your lift for the selectors and as a yard man or spotter driver same time check your spotter truck and start pulling trailers and reloading trailers in the doors that they are suppose to go in by also using your computer screen in your spotter truck.
good,"Working at Publix is a very fast paced environment, There is little to none employee appreciation, Publix will work you to the bone and continue to to take from you without giving anything in return. I have asked multiple times for things to change and there has been no efforts for that to happen. Maybe it was just the store i worked at, but other employees i have talked to have said the same issues. I worked in the grocery department and maybe customer service is easier. I would not recommend it. Most people in other departments including grocery did not do their jobs correctly which left extra work for the next person. The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving for the day. The hardest part of the job is blocking the store, which isn't hard, it is just so tiring and time consuming and mind numbing that it becomes hard."
good,"It's an okay place to work. The managers are very respectful and my coworkers are pleasant to work with. However, the hours are terrible and its very inconsistent. One week they give you up to 35 hours(rarely), and other weeks they cut it as low as 15 hours or 10 hours weekly. Its really a major problem because I have car payment, mortgage, and other responsibilities. I can't rely solely in this Job financially. Otherwise I'm going to lose everything I worked so hard to achieve."
good,"Great flexibility around a busy schedule and managers are understanding of class schedules. Downside: as a cashier, you stand for hours, which can be debilitating on a person. After work, I was always exhausted."
good,"Deli position is challenging because at Publix customers all ways come first. Employees are required to drop what they are doing immediately as a customer approaches."
good,"The customer will always be right, even if they are calling all of the workers incompetent. The customers are allowed to treat the employees terribly and then are given gift cards if they complain enough."
good,"- liked the job, customers and fellow co-workers"
good,"Fast pace and busy grocery store. A typical day consisted of bagging groceries, carrying out carts, leveling grocery isles, retrieving carts from the parking lot, and various nightly closing assignments. Because customer service is so important as a Publix employee, you come out of the job with a more respectful attitude when addressing customers. Management is very professional and friendly towards customers but lacks empathy towards employees. Work is generally busy and employees are exhausted which results in little interaction between co-workers. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet for long hours and a lot of strain on your body. The most enjoyable part of the job is the friendly interactions with customers."
good,4 plus years at Publix and slowly was sick of it after two years. If you don't kiss butt you will not get promoted. They hire way to many employees and cut hours of present employees
good,Its a welcoming environment and clean space and its great first job. you are required to have a good attitude and great with customers. and you have to have the ability to handle difficult situations.
good,Don't plan on having a life if you work here.  I've never seen anything like it in all of my 51 years  Terrible experience working at the Wilmington store
good,"Good company to work for willing to help you out if your a good employee. Very hard to advance, misleading on the stock option for the company, ie need 1,500 clocked hours before 1 year anniversary date to obtain and must continue with that trend."
good,"I go to work cook meals and have the customers sample it, Wash up the dishes and cook again and sample it then wash the dishes. I do this for 8 hours part time."
good,"Publix cultivates a Hierarchy type of management, where at any given time one of 10-15 managers can tell you to do anything and treat you like trash. They overwork you for the pay and zero compensation unless you're full time for a long while."
good,Strict set of rules and guidelines. Everything must be followed precisely. Must provide great customer service and always look presentable. Some co-workers can be slackers. The hardest part of the job is assessing a situation quickly and finding the quickest and most efficient way to handle it. The most enjoyable part of the job is how grateful the customers always seem after I help them settle a problem.
good,had to pay bills horrible hours no benefits part time  cant live on 20 hours a week. no advancement ! had to venders job every day.
good,"the only great thing are the co-workers and their ability to have fun.  Management is the hardest part to get through on project time lines and what can truly get down.  Management doesn't make the best devisions and because of those decisions the employees are the ones having to make up for it.  Mandatory work on weekends and late nights to meet deadlines.  Project planning is always ""best case"" scenario even though there has never been a best case scenario."
good,"Retail is stressful, long days,  up and down schedules. No stability especially if you are a single parent. Ok job if you can get along with people and if you like to work holidays with no pay or time off."
good,At the time I worked there Publix was facing class actions lawsuits over compensation and promotion practices from multiple minority groups.
good,"Unless you intend to become a manager and your employers like you enough to train you so that you can advance, its a nice starter job."
good,"I disliked going to work.  They did nothing wrong in the way of employment and I knew what I signed up for but I still had a dragging feeling when I was there. Time seemed to drag on and the tasks I had to do were monotonous and boring. On top of that, I was being paid minimum wage and after waiting what seemed like forever for my first evaluation and doing nothing wrong in my duties, my raise was but a few pennies. Managers were nice but not very personable and the rules were extremely strict."
good,"The security dept. is very unprofessional, untrained and disorganized."
good,"I learned a lot while in this position. I started as a cashier and moved up the line quickly to Customer Service Staff. It should really be relabeled as Customer Service Supervisor because that is exactly what this job entailed. I started out learning how to run the front office which included western union and other money services, basic reception skills, refunds, returns, etc., then moved onto the back office where I learned how to count down tills and break down/prep the money for the store daily, deposit the store's income and balance the safe. I had done deposits before but never in this large of a quantity, it proved to be the most challenging when I started out. Next was front end coordination, it consisted of creating the plan of action for the day. You were required to set up the cashiers and baggers according to scheduled times and breaks, monitor the floor associates and ensure they stayed on task, and to direct chaotic situations in the event of a rush of customers checking out or  employee call outs. At the end of the night the coordinator was responsible for distributing closing tasks among the closing employees and monitor the progress/ accuracy of said tasks. This was definitely a lead by example position and was the most challenging thing I have ever experienced in a job. It prepared me for entry level management and taught me a lot of patience with myself and others. It pushed me to hone skills I never knew I had and definitely tested my limits, but I came out successful and eventually transferred departments to the pharmacy for a more challenging position."
good,Not a wonderful place. They take advantage of employees and work them the maximum alloted hours before full time and then cut hours to refrain from giving full time with benefits.
good,Publix is an okay place to work at. It's a good highschool job. Once you hit college your hours get cut. They also will randomly cut hours and schedule you when your not available.
good,this job is ok if you dont mind working at a very fast pace for more than five or more hours a day
good,Some management issues but overall the customers and co-workers are pleasant to work with.
good,"I liked the  company, but couldn't  maintain the night shift schedule and wasn't allowed to apply myself to the best benefit of the company."
good,• I've learned a good communication skill which allows me to provide good customer service.
good,"during the peak season I will work from 1pm to 10pm on average with 35 hrs per week, then during off season I get knocked down to 15 to 20 hrs per week with no hopes of full time."
good,"My typical work is long, and your always looking at the clock. What I learned is that the customer is ALWAYS right even when they are dead wrong. Management is lazy, and sit in their offices all day unless the building is burning down. My co-workers gossip all the time. The hardest part of my job is being fake. The most enjoyable part of my day is going home."
good,I worked there for almost three years and planned to try and make it work but couldnt. Was told I couldnt be full time (after being told I would many many times) because of my race. Management is just not on your side at all. The way they talk to employees and dept. managers was not good. The focus on customers while good was overly done to the point of making the employees feel awful. Dept Managers could care less about employees from my experience. One of my store managers particularly had me leave the dept i worked in because the dept manager had it out for me because i knew more than all of his employees and him when i was transferred from another town and the store manager moved me to cashier where she said she would take care of me because i was a great employee only to screw me over and take a good amount of my pay and dropped my hours from 36 to 7 in a week. So its hard to say I would recommend working there but they do pay and thats one of the good things if you want to hate yourself for working there.
good,"Working there was alright, although there isn’t much to advance in there and would like to go somewhere else. Also it’s very repetitive and there’s not much to do"
good,The company as a whole is not a bad company but the store I worked in was horrible. Managers are awful and in a lot of ways treat employees unfairly. Your expected to jump through hoops and do twice if not three times the work for hardly nothing. You very rarely get complimented. Management holds people back from being able to move up in the company and retaliate by cutting hours.  Not to mention it you get hurt on the job they treat you poorly.
good,"The managers love to say that they're flexible, but the moment i tried to prioritize my school, they gave me attitude and threatened to lower my hours."
good,"I clock in and do the same thing every single day. There is never a change in my routine, and it drains you. I would say some positives: everyone hates their job there, so you don't feel alone on that. You have to get a raise every six months, it may be the bare minimum, but it is something. They give you benefits, like stock (they will not teach you about it whatsoever but its there). You can change stores and change your availability. Now there is a long list of negatives but to state a few: The evaluations are tough to get high on no matter how hard you work; it is all based on favoritism. They do not care what's going on outside of work, want you to come in. They will say there is room for ""advancement,"" but there isn't. "
good,I really enjoy working with my fellow associates.  I enjoy working with the public and assisting them in any way I can.  I only wish they would give me more hours.
good,The pharmacy is chronically understaffed with a constant increase in workload without increased staffing. Work/life balance is poor. Salaried pharmacists must stay 2-3 hours late after most shifts without extra compensation in order to accomplish all tasks.
good,Just a lot of hype about working there. Basically the same as any other retail store. Lots of misleading information and to much favortism and racism. Lacks diversity in management. No people of color in lead positions....just the same good ole boys controlling everything.
good,"I worked there for almost a year and I always struggle to get the hours i need it. They hire all the time and i think that affects everyone's hours. It is impossible to make the mark for the benefits they offer part-timers. I like their 401k though, it was nice being able to save even though you are a part-timer and i also liked their credit union since it has very low rates on almost everything. I would come back if would be ok working only a few hours a week. Customers are so sweet."
good,"management did not help at all with teaching on job and takes forever to get full time, hard to get fired but takes forever to get seen for an interview."
good,Publix is a good place to work if you can stand the customers. Management is typically lax on certain rules. Maintaining your appearance is mandatory.
good,If you don't suck up to management then you're nothing but a work horse with no chance of advancement. Going above and beyond for this company means nothing. Everything depends on your manager and assistant manager. If you're lucky you get a good one.
good,"The management is unfair and highly biased. I have asked to changed my position and I have not heard anything back. The hours are quite ridiculous, I am lucky to get six a week despite asking more than once for more."
good,"Working at Publix, the hours were always very little and the pay wasn't good. Publix has so many employees so they would only schedule people for 3 hours a day, twice a week."
good,"Very stressful work environment, pays well but not worth the money to me. Long hours everyday but still not enough, no matter what you do there is always something wrong"
good,It started out fun in a nice place to work I had a kid so I had to be part-time and when I wanted to advance there was no opportunities for me to Advance
good,"My boss doesn't send me text messages. "
good,"Great benefits and stock options. "
good,"Hours fluctuate from what you are told you will be working. Advancement is limited and raises are poor. Management is constantly changing, with new managers comes new changes that take a lot to adapt to."
good,Publix is all about their customers and not such much about it's employees. The specific store I worked at had a very high front end turn over rate. I did not have the best experience at this particular store.
good,"For what they wanted me to be able to do in my position, I needed more training, to which they promised to give me, but failed to do so. The department I worked in was severely understaffed and the managers were unappreciative."
good,"I would recommend Publix as a first job while in high school or as a retirement job because you want to get out of the house. As far as a career, if you do not fit into the mold they are looking for, you will not get far. As a full time employee, you can not afford a decent living, yet you make too much for low income to help with the bills."
good,"It started out being great but I had all my managers on different pages and I had a supervisor who had it in for me that even though I tried to report no one helped me. They brought in new people instead of giving the ones they had options to move up into other roles. They really pushed “fundraising” and would check and watch if you weren’t taking donations and you did get in trouble if you weren’t asking. I saw people I worked with walk out on their shift here and there and I eventually understood why. I just never felt appreciated as a hard working employee, it was clear I was replaceable."
good,"The job was very straightforward, some managers went on and beyond to help their employees and especially customers, but for other managers it was all about their numbers looking good on the paper rather than the care for their employees."
good,The pay was good but management and employees were not a walk in the park. Very rude and complicated. Very demanding and not professional. Publix being my first job Gave me hope and plus the reputation they built for themselves. And it was disappointing.
good,Fast paced and sometimes fun but sadly hardly any opportunity for advancement. The best part of the day is working with people that you have become close to.
good,"the management is terrible, i been at publix almost 4 years and they still haven't gave me full time, i been given 20 hours every week  my check be small every week i dont be having a nuff for my bills and im tired of it!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,"Good company to work for if you’re full time. If you’re part time they don’t really take care of you. They make promises, but don’t act on them. I would only recommend working here if you’re in high school. Or you’re a senior citizen and need to get out of the house."
good,The co-workers I worked with were very friendly and we worked together as a team.  The supervisor in the Bakery was very professional and was a team worker.  The pay at Publix is not good.  Everyone there had a second job.  You cannot have a family life outside of Publix because you are always working week days and weekends.
good,"It's retail. There are good days and bad days but most days are just plain boring. There is o money in the retail world unless you are management, and then the money isn't worth the degredation some folks want to put others through."
good,"Publix is a great place to start if you want a career in retail. Although, it is difficult to get full-time and benefits. The hours are sparse and management has a high turn around so you never know what you'll get."
good,"The people there are good people, Management is nice but definitely undertrained. They would rather hire a bunch of kids 16-17 right out of highschool then to promote people who invest 40 hours a week. They don't want to give you benefits."
good,"I thought I would retire with Publix but things changed, they have changed so much from their core founding principles that the founder is probably rolling over in his grave. Management sucks, completely, it's all cooperate now.... You are just a number now."
good,I would arrive at 3 in the afternoon. Do a little inventory of what was needed on the sales floor. Check the boxes for customers products that were being picked up that day. As the other employees would be leaving for the day I would make sure that each section of the bakery was cleaned and ready for the following day. Management played favorite with open work hours. The people were alright but I was happy to work alone in the evenings.
good,"work day was usually 8-10 hours depending on job. i had several different ones,plus overtime when needed.  I learned how to be cross-trained in many different jobs. Very customer oriented job. Management for the most part was ok."
good,Extremely lot of work with little pay . I work every weekend no time for family . Very fast  atmosphere and time consuming.   Very clean place to work.  Working in the freezer and lifting over 50lbs or more.
good,"*terrible management working hours"
good,Company is run by mid-20-something year olds.  Liberal doesn't begin to describe. Everyone is sleeping with everyone else. Pay is on par for grocery chains.  Not for the 40+ crowd or for those with morals.
good,Publix has changed over the years and not the same anymore. They once cared about their employees but that too has changed. Long days and nights is not enough time for family.
good,"Publix is a great first job and kick off to your future. After spending 10+ years it became tiresome. Long days, long commute, no family time, no holidays, micromanagement."
good,"While my coworkers were great, the lower managers were terrible and ruined my experience with the company. lack of listening or opportunity for advancement lead me to leave the company."
good,"worked behind the deli counter, sliced deli meats and cheeses, made subs and salads, Kitchen, Platters. The most enjoyable part of working for Public was my associates. The most difficult was Management."
good,Publix is a very inclusive company that offers great opportunities for young employees.  Benefits are not very good but you can work as many hours as you want.
good,Publix pays good depending where you work. If you work in the store you're going to start off part time and make just above minimum wage. If you work in the distribution you're going to make more money faster and be full time.
good,"muy buena compañía pero no ofrece seguridad laboral para los part timer, buena cultura laboral."
good,very stressful job. Typically overworked and underpaid. the hardest part of the job is putting in your all but instead of rewards you are given unfair judgement and age discrimination.
good,"To start, Publix is a great place to work if you did not graduate High School or do not have a GED. It is an option to advance in a company and make good money without having any qualifications. Basically, if you work hard and ""bleed green"" you will do well here. On the other hand, do not work here if you have aspirations outside of a grocery store. It is very difficult to move into the corporate side of the company."
good,"Company has great benefits. The retirement opportunities are beyond satisfactory. The only negatives I have to say about this job is while on the road to promotion you have to know how to politic. Hard work is often times overlooked if you aren't  on great terms with management. The PTO system at publix is beyond satisfactory. Another positive is if you are full time you will be guaranteed 40 hours per week. The company could use more diversity in management, specifically African Americans."
good,"I started working at Publix when I started college in 2015 and recently quit. It's a VERY easy job and you get paid decently. I enjoyed my job except that it was often stressful, managers were never around, it was very hard to advance (only the ""favorites"" would be able to), and it was very hard to get hours. I quit because in my 2 years of working there it was impossible to get any hours even with a very open schedule, and management was terrible."
good,"Poor management, they only care about numbers not the associates, if you call in sick you are forever known as the terrible associate, lack of concern, no communication skills from management."
good,"Publix is not a bad place to work for as long as you go in not expecting too much from them. There ESOP program for employees is nice. However, if you're not in management they barely pay you enough to live on."
good,always busy and a lot of standing and walking. If you are in  school and depending on your major or trade there is tuition reimbursement. There is always some form of training either face to face or on the computor
good,"Managers are inconsistent with their expectations of associates. Your job task changes every 30 minutes, making leftover floats pile up in the backroom."
good,"This is a great job for somebody who is finishing high school because it teaches the new recruit  to learn what customer service is about. You learn how to manage difficult customers and nice customers. Also, how merchandise is placed on the shelves, i. e. last in first out, etc.  Unfortunately, there is not much career advancement for an older person who comes with previous working experience."
good,"It's a great company if you start out with someone else to support you. However, if you start out while trying to be self-sustaining, you will be sorely disappointed. No matter what your experience, everyone starts out at the bottom and at part-time, hourly pay. While that seems fair at first, it is impractical for anybody like me trying to provide for his family. Also, pay is decent but with the extremely high standards required for advancement, don't expect to make anything more than $10 your first two years."
good,"The management and most employees are not team players,They think by putting you down and tattletailing is a way to get the job done.Publix promotes unexperinced people who only get ahead based om being under 30 years old and how much they try to get their fellow coworkers in trouble"
good,Managers don't care about you. You are nothing more than a seat filler to them and you are more than replaceable. If someone with the right position doesn't like you all will be done to make sure you no longer have a job.
good,"The warehouse I worked at was very unorganized and unsafe. However, there was a lot of leisure and leniency given due to the lack of motivated managers. They preach they are a family but have fired numerous associates who have worked extremely hard to bring them high revenues. The pay is ok but the pain on the feet and joints outweighs the income. Overall a good company to work for if you want to get decent pay and don't mind hard labor and a rotating schedule or underqualified management."
good,"I didn't feel value while working for Publix. It was a relaxed workplace but just not for me, I have more ambition and working here made me feel lack of worth."
good,"It's what you would have expected for a first-time job. The bottom-level employees are doing the standard fare such as bagging, helping out with stock, or grabbing carts. Otherwise performing janitorial duties which should honestly be contracted out to janitors."
good,"I worked in the Deli. I learned how to cook chicken,make subs and wraps, slice lunch meat. I also learned how to package and weight food that was not already packaged."
good,"It could be an excellent place to work, but every job has its pros and cons.... I worked there and loved it and did not want to leave the company, but my store manager tried and to make my time there not pleasant at all.. I really miss the regular customers and my old co workers."
good,"It was a fine job, just not enough hours.  Wanted more hours but was unable to get them.  To many college aged employees, they seemed to get the hours."
good,Was a very fun job at first. But it seemed as if nobody really cared if they called out sick leaving you as the only person in the department for the whole shift. I would compare this to a fast food job.
good,Got to put on a front evey manager in there is fake very disrespect they care more about the name their making instead of employees and don’t give you any info if they are sending you to another store just expect you to be mind readers
good,"very fast paced and busy, had to be able to learn fast and multi task, had to deal with public and no matter what they were always right even if they talked down to u, management never really gave praise on when things were wrong"
good,I sometimes did not get many hours in the off season. Manager makes schedule and the hours you get are determined by whether the manager likes you or if you are a favorite or not. Stock options and 401k are the best part of working at Publix.
good,publix is an okay place to work but its not for everybody they are very stingy on full time depending on the store manager and they tease you on hours.
good,I love the job. I love my customers. Its just I need full time with benefits an publix doesnt offer full time. The good thing is the stock. And also meeting new people who you serve. I like to stay busy an at publix there is plenty to do
good,"Hard to balance life and work, rotating schedule, only get one weekend off a month. But they do pay good and free lunch everyday. You don't know when youll get off, everyone there can be replaced."
good,Love the overall experience with my job but every job has its downside. The higher anyone goes into management the harder it is to keep a balance between the demands of work and the responsibility of life and family.
good,"Stand all shift long scanning items, answering questions about promotions and processnig coupons. At the end of the day take all the unwanted merchandise back to the shelves and fix the cards and magazines."
good,Large Corporation with a Diverse work culture.  Full Time employment has become rare and benefits are not as prevalent as it once was. Employees are agreeable and management is helpful to employees and customers.
good,"For a temporary, part-time job, Publix was great. They paid me above the current minimum wage, and most of my coworkers where very friendly. Not much upward momentum."
good,Good place to start a new career many good manager a good benefit they are not good  with full time and always finding extra things for people to do pays small
good,"The job was a good job at first, considering I had just started school. Hours were flexible at first, until it became difficult to juggle both at the same time. For part-timers, the benefits weren't good enough and the job culture was very dramatic and felt like High School again."
good,I would say that it is not the worst place to work at but it could be a lot better they are losing there way with how they treat employs the need to correct that problem are it will have an effect on the company in the near future ........
good,"I am a college student, and I was recently looking to get a part time job to pick up some extra cash. I got hired at publix and it seemed great at first, I quickly learned that was not completely the case. I had left my availability open for all hours but explicitly stated I only could work around 15 to 20 hours a week, but that quickly turned into 35 hours. If you are looking for a job that will give you a lot of hours to make ends meet this is a great place for you. If you want to work for extra cash and just pick up hours when avalible? Apply elsewhere! I had to change my avalibility, between classes and work, I don't have time to eat sleep or do anything else. This sounds like a problem most people would love to have, but for me as a student its the one thing I can't make work. I also was moved to a new store quickly after being hired. I then learned they wanted me to do custodial work which is not the job I was hired for. It wasn't that the work was hard or too much to ask of me, but when I was hired no one told me this would be required of me. When I asked why I was expected to do this when it was never in the job description they told me ""everyone is taking a share of the work"". That would be fine if that was true, they pile the work on the employees who do it correctly and let the others essentially slack off. Overall I am fairly neutral with the job itself, for some people all of the things I described might sound like a dream come true, but for me personally it is not working."
good,"Since working for them I realized the management is selfish and money hungry, always looking for the next pawn in their scheme, having many hours more than others but that's because I found out I was the lowest paid employee, and if you don't do what they ask they will find a way to make you pay. Every year they make sure to work you right under the amount of hours you need to get certain benefits claiming the computer makes the schedule and they can't control it. Maybe it was just the stores I worked for but I wouldn't want my worst enemy working for them people"
good,"Working for Publix can be a great full time job, Full of wonderful co-workers and benefits. Part time works may find themselves struggling through the summer months/ off season."
good,Publix makes it impossible for people to move up in the company. I have been in the same position for 9 years. I have applied for hundreds of jobs and never had any luck.
good,"Publix Teaches you a lot to advance through the company, but it has its moments where it could be chaotic at times. Publix lacks a lot of communication from the corporate office down to the management down to the associates(etc.). But Publix also has a lot a room where you can grow and get promoted and advance in the company."
good,easy workplace. great people to work with and management isnt bad. benefits are really only for full time employees and you have to work for over a year to even get mentioned for full time.
good,"My coworkers were great, the management needs improvement in enthusiasm. I learned that you have to show everyone how hard you work, and that the customer is always right. The hardest part of the job was working alone on busy days, and you have to commit a lot of your time working here as the managers are no where in sight to assist you when needed. A typical day of work consists of repetitively hard labor and organization. Getting used to the culture where you're treated as family until your 6th month on the job when it becomes a boot camp. But, the most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying the customers and making your coworkers happy and motivated with your own positive mindset."
good,Here's my honest opinion on working for Publix...it was a good place to work upper management was great and my coworkers were all great people supervisors were terrible on the other hand the warehouse was like high school a lot of fights and confrontations at least 2 people will be fired a week so everyone was afraid of losing there jobs start time was based on what department you work frozen food was 5am or 6am until all orders were finish which was around 4:00pm the latest was 6:00pm box meat dairy started at 5am and produce start 5am but you can't get overtime unless it was peek season or they would tell you to go home the starting pay was 11.25 for warehouse workers and 13-25$ For selectors based on performance it was a tough job with a lot of stress but I did not mind the only reason why I hated it was because the supervision team sucked and was  not fair I saw a lot people lose there jobs overall a ok place but not along career so glad I moved on
good,"I loved my job at Publix for most of my career there. I received ample support and guidance until it seemed as if the culture had changed. Full time employees with any longevity, who were not management, were  being made to feel uncomfortable about their job security. Younger associates required lower wages and it became, silently, all about the numbers. I, as well as many of my long-time co-workers,felt there was no longer a home with Publix,"
good,Be ready to work for every dime you make. I mean work. It is like any other customer service position. Customers complain and management strokes a check.
good,this publix i work at is always on a huge power struggle with hours it is not a great way to start out at publix for this location so much work but very little hours not a job to have at the one i work at if you have a family to support do not apply at this one and the managers do not help their employees what so ever.
good,Publix is a good company to work for but they could use better management practices. The deli is the hardest area to work at in Publix.
good,"Good company good benefits, Pay scale good. But retirement is good if you want to just coast to the end. People are nice for the most part and some associates get free lunch."
good,"A typical day at work is me either going in at 6 am for production or going in around 2:30 pm to have a closing shift, which can last up until 11/12 pm. I've learned that not everyone goes to work just to work, they go to gossip and start drama which is annoying. Our management sucks he's never around and all he does is criticize his employees. Our new assistant deli manager is very attentive and encouraging. my co-workers are very lazy, they do selective (jobs they want to do) jobs and make newbies do everything else. i would say my job is not hard at all but it is hard to work with lazy people because then you have to pick up their slack. the most enjoyable part of  my job is leaving everyday honestly."
good,"At Publix, customers feel safe and clean. Publix provide customer service on a higher level than other retail stores. Publix stays busy so there is always something to do. Co-workers are friendly but mangers are not on the same page"
good,"Publix is a great company where you can actually make a career off without having a degree.  However, once you are up in a management position, you are required to work long hours."
good,"I learned at lot from this job.  I learned how to decorate cakes, pastries & desserts.  The Managers were not on the same page.  They argued a little bit too much."
good,stock shelves help customers run register order section unload ttruck assist customers as need be
good,"While younger it is many kids dream to be a bagger as their first job. But just keep it at that, dont let them trap you into staying for years. It is a great company to work for, but if you are going to get a degree there are many other occupations that will better prepare you and compensate you more. If you are looking for a part time or a career in the grocery world, Publix is the best."
good,Publix is a great company just not what I am looking for at this time.
good,"This was a job I took when no other jobs where available.  In my time there, I did receive raises, and awards, but ultimately that did not equate to a living wage."
good,"A typical day at work included assisting customers over the phone and face-to-face with questions about products and custom cake orders. There was also daily production. For each day of the week there was a different topic of things that had to be done. Everything that I know about working in a bakery, bread, decorating cakes, and doing custom cakes I learned from Publix."
good,"this company is a rotating door of employees and management they do not help employees when they are having problems with personal life, they are unorganized company that needs more training"
good,My experience at Publix is I enjoy helping Customers.At my positions at publix I enjoy providing my best ability of making others happy by great customer service
good,"There is a lot of favoritism to long time employees and nepotism with management that the work environment is unfair and unproductive, with most of the work being thrust (unfairly) on the newer employees while the older senor staff kick back and laze around. On a side note the management is incompetent to the point the customers complain on the quality of her leadership almost every day."
good,"Typical day to day duties included,"
good,"They will use you up, and when done, will get rid of you like any other company. When I look back at working with this company, I really can not tell you the first genuine thank you I ever received. I guess in my case, even though I was evaluated consistantly as a role model, I still got the feeling I was not good enough for this organization. "
good,"Publix was my second job ever and I it was a learning experience. Management wasn't loyal to it's employees at all, and I knew I couldn't stay there for years to come. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the disrespectful customers(some not all), and my supervisor condoning gossip."
good,"Package out products,answer dept phones, help customers in placing cake orders, and make sure the dept is clean and presentable."
good,"A typical day consist of serving customers, making platters, making sub sandwiches, slicing lunch meat & cheese, preparing chicken for the customers, & making sure everything is clean & sanitized. During my years working there I learned patience, how to do inventory, pull dates (fifo), and provide good customer service. The hardest part of the job is adjusting to the different customers and and their attitudes. The most enjoyable part of the job is serving someone and knowing you made their day a little bit easier."
good,"PT employees are Publix's bread-and-butter, and get treated accordingly. 1500 hours per year are required to attain health benefits, so expect to only work around 1450 if you're lucky. Also, only expect to bring home $180-$220 a week. Corporate starts getting irritated when you work more than 30 hours in a week."
good,"sem anormalidades , pude aprender a ouvir mais do que falar"
good,Managing the front end
good,You had to have great coustomer service skills you deal with different people day in and out.
good,"I worked the front end. We would have fun, address customers by name, keep area clean, and help the stockers when needed."
good,"At Publix, you work hard with continuous productivity, and structure. It is very good honest hard work that feels good knowing you can help people just by giving them a good experience in the small amount of time it takes them to shop for groceries."
good,"This used to be a company that I believed in, and would have done anything for. Unfortunately, as typical, when a company becomes as big as this one has, they lose what they were founded upon in the first place. No matter what you do, or how you do it, you become nothing more then a number. Too many people have become brainwashed and can not think for themselves, as if they do, they are cast as an outsider. The worst part is that no one in upper management has a clue as to whats actually happeing, or they don't care. Had it not been for just a few people, I would probably still love working at this company."
good,"Working there is okay as a first job, but after a little while it begins to suck so bad. Where I work I've been stuck doing the same thing for 2 nd a half years and have not been able to learn anything new"
good,mi experiencia no fue muy placentera todavía falta organización en el deli department
good,"7.5 years, met a lot of nice people, and worked with cool managers. Overall it is a mixed review, from the insane hours to the overnights and long weekends."
good,Good job overall enjoyed my coworkers but I didn’t get the hours I wanted and they were just waiting for a reason to fire me when they really didn’t have to. Put 3 years coming up 4 in February and I hadn’t moved up at other than to a cashier from a bagger (Front service Clerk). They wouldn’t schedule me enough to pay bills sometimes so I had to find other jobs
good,It’s an okay job for people just starting out but I personally don’t think it could be a long term job. There are some pretty great benefits though. Definitely a good start up job.
good,I was not happy at all here. Too much work and not enough staff.  Over worked and under paid.  Was scheduled over 35 hrs a week and still did not give me full time.
good,They were suppose to treat their employees like they were customers to encourage them to shop at Publix but that wasn’t it at all. I felt disrespected on a daily & felt rotations were a bit unfair hence they’d prefer the men to be outside rather than the girls. The management was corrupt and seemed to not truly care about their employees.
good,"Orienation was a farce. They don't give you raises every 6 months. The Managers stink, the store managers are better. But if you don't suck up to the boss in your department ( Customer Service) you will never advance. I didn't care for my bosses any of them, I transferred and he was no better than the former boss. This is a great job for high schoolers and collage people, if you want to grow don't come here to do it."
good,"Being more open to customers. I learned how to use the cash register."
good,"they are a good job and i enjoyed working there, but they hire too many people and within 6 months you start losing hours quickly. i enjoyed the other employees but sometimes didnt enjoy the way i was treated by the management"
good,"The first year I worked with Publix Deli, I loved it. Then I learned that this job is stressful, and very high maintenance, very hot and you are 'conditioned' to treat your customers like 'Royalty'. Some customers are wonderful and genuinely a joy to work for and others act like they don't have the time of day for you. YOU WILL GET CUSSED OUT EVENTUALLY. At first I had a great team and management was pretty cool. But every six months or so management gets jumbled as people get promotions and move on to new jobs. If you do not have a good team or even a good manager things can go wrong. Some mangers care about you as people and think of customer service first, you also have other managers who think they are your friend and goofing off is more important than food safety. And still others only care about their own advancement and don't really care what happens to their department as long as they look good. It's a good job for a little while. At least in my personal experience in the Deli it has been a roundabout of emotions, one day I will love it the next I will hate it. I've been trying my best to move over to a different department to try out my skills in other areas and my manger has blocked me every chance he gets. If you plan to work for Publix go anywhere but the Deli. Best places to work at Publix are seafood and bakery department."
good,"The managers were pretty awesome. "
good,"Nothing spectacular to say about it, it's a grocery store stocking shelves, unloading trucks, running cash registers the usual things that such a place requires."
good,"Too hard work and too much stres for low money.Not enough hours for part time workers."
good,"Working behind the deli counter, you immediately know it is a very fast paced and highly stressful working environment. The no-good deli manager(Not assistant), lacks people skills, treats Publix employees like complete trash, and has had customers/employees make written and verbal complaints about her behavior to corporate and her current store managers. She has been from store to store and I have been able to speak to her former employees and different managers, and it was noted that she behaves the same disgusting way in every store she gets transferred to. She is only there because ""she knows her business and is able to produce."" Of course, Publix is all about the money, but when you have your employees reeling in the money for you, you ought to treat them with dignity and respect, not yelling and speaking ""smartly"" to them in front of customers and other fellow associates, ridiculing individuals who do not accept her unacceptable demeanor and even calling employees that report her, ""liars"". There have been several occasions where employees decide to clock out immediately after having an altercation with her because of the type of treatment they receive from her. It's a huge disappointment that Publix would retain and essentially approve this type of gross behavior because of her experience in the department. Will I recommend Publix as a place to work? Yes, but please do not accept any ridiculous behavior from upper management."
good,"I had high hopes when I joined the Publix team but they were quickly dashed. You really have no life. Publix comes first and they will tell you that. Management is not trained properly and if you want to advance you need to relocate. Every aspect of the job is micromanaged and emploees are treated like morons. The way the heirarchy is set up, there is nobody to take a problem to."
good,"I have had managers that made me want to excel and move up, and yet I have also had managers that would damage my mental health with their pettiness that I was suicidal. "
good,"Publix has a different air. They supply the work shirts and aprons, but you supply the pants and non-slip shoes. Its a good job. I enjoyed the work aspect. Being blamed for everything that went wrong in the department, another story. It was why i was transferring to the Deli from the bakery. It was apparent a few of the clerks with bakery didnt want me there and convinced the manager I was doing things I hadnt. She even got me written up. So be careful, you need people on your side to even think of moving up to management or a good raise. You need referrals. So if you cant play the politician game you wont make it. I received an offer of full time to another place so left. I was only getting 21 hours a week as part time. If I was given more hours, I would have stayed honestly. But they give their part timers as few hours as they can. and everyone starts as part time. you have to earn and be recommended by management to get full time."
good,"Everyone is on their own page and never had thought of others to inform them on what's needed to be done and when that dowant happen, someone gets in trouble and day goes bad."
good,"Worked 10 years for this company.  Developed a great customer base during this time.  At first pay was not competitive, however it has improved.  They offer extensive on the job training.  Their motto is ""if you jave time to lean, you have time to clean"".  Management changes too frequently and so does the rule playbook.  Investigate your store if your interested.  Talk to the associates and see what they think.   Ask questions.  I watched the company ho from family oriented to corporate mongers.  Was terminated for no longer being A YES GIRL and standing my ground.  They constantly write people up for not ""squaring up"" the carts.  Youll be a mindless drone!!"
good,"I've been employed with Publix since November of 2015. I was hired on as a meat and cheese clerk in the meat department. After some time of constantly asking to be a meat cutter, I was finally moved up. A year ago I took the testing to be an assistant meat manager; however, I was passed over for reasons that seemed very, very petty (nothing significant to my job). Unless you exceed expectations they will not give you a raise, not even for meeting. It's not terrible to work at Publix, the customers are nice enough most times; yet, management needs to be re-evaluated."
good,It depends on what store your at because you can be there for 16 years and they still wont promote you so it's all about the store your at and if they like you or not .
good,I just didn’t like how they gave me few hours I wasn’t happy on the hours they gave me  when I did ask for more they will fix it but do it again I wasn’t happy at all so my mother made me quit
good,"I have worked at Publix for 3 years. During that time, I have worked at multiple locations for various periods of time. I was often sent to other stores to help them when they were short staffed. My original store was busy, but the team of people, including managers, were great. The store I transferred to in Alabama is not good at all! The upper management of my store does not know how to boost moral and makes Publix a terrible place to work and shop."
good,"I worked as a part-time cashier. The schedule was flexible but difficult to get more than 20 hours per week. The pace is steady, but very busy on weekends."
good,"Unfortunately the multiple stores I’ve worked at were like going back to high school but instead of class work you have physical work of course but I mean many people would sleep around and many would talk bad about others who didn’t deserve it, even some managers would talk bad about their subordinates to other subordinates and you have to kiss butt just to get any type of promotion."
good,I have no need to review Publix.  My future employment should have nothing to do with Publix or the manner they operate.  Trying to get to the 150 m8nimum is a waste of time just to proceed with this process.
good,"Stressful, fast-paced work environment.  Expectations were too high if I were to provide excellent customer service to each guest. I tried to provide each guest with an excellent experience rather than ignore the guest and focus on stocking."
good,"This job can be stressfu at times. It has its perks when cashing out nice customers, others can be a bit rude & QUITE demanding. Many old white people"
good,"While Publix is an amazing company on paper, advancing with the company is less about what you know and more about who you know. I've seen many capable people lose out on a promotion to a someone still learning basics, so you end up with a less desirable management base. Assistant dept. managers training their soon-to-be managers is a common thread within Publix"
good,Publix can be a great company to work for however due to poor management (at my store) it’s not. If your manger is good they will be moved to a different store and will move up. This happen to my two good managers in under 10 months each. Publix does this so there isn’t a buddy system which I understand. However if my current managers absolutely sucks and has been here over a year and hasent changed. Publix doesn’t do anything about the bad ones in my case at least. And competition has better hourly wages and isn’t as strict.
good,"With the right management team it can be a fairly good place to work."
good,"This is a good place to work if you enjoy customer service and can deal with a lot of foolish questions on a regular basis. over the years though it seems like the company has been sacrificing quality for financial gain (and by company I mean anyone above a store manager that doesn't actually work in the stores). pay is alright, though they demand much of your time or don't give you any hours"
good,"New management every two years"
good,The company does not offer any benefits to part timers. A typical day we were short handed....not enough staff on the front end. Management did not respond in a timely manner when called to assist with customers.
good,Ive been both a full time and a part time associate. The place can be stressful but retiring with stock is great if you can handle all the stress. They micromanage and they dont care about your needs when it comes to schedules. If you cant work what they want then you get no hours.
good,you have no say on what you work you work when they need you they own you dont care that u have a family part timers cater to get good hours full timers used to fill spots that part timers cant work
good,"A great workplace, strict management, excessive rules,  minimum requirement, great for a part-time job if your going to school,  if you're not willing to pursue a full-time career with publix then look for a different career path."
good,It is a nice company to work for. Wish I was able to become full time.  Love the people I helped and work with. Just wanted more. I will still look for more.
good,Do not expect to get much out of this company for a long standing career. Most investment is in stock if you understand how the process works and only then you can receive benefits at full-time and 401K.
good,"This used to be a much different company to work for.  Much Better.  Always hard work, but you had a chance and could get full time and did get bonuses.  Now those are gone and though they still have full time postions they are more difficult to get.  Seems like they may go at sometime to all part time workforce other than management."
good,A typical day at work consists of various interactions with customers and employees. The hardest part of the job is money services through Western Union and the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact with customers and employees.
good,"Publix has always been known as one of the best companies to work for. They offer great benefits and stocks to their employees. Publix cared about its employees and customers. However, in my opinion, that has changed in the last few years. Labor hours has been cut, more pressure is placed on pharmacists and techs, etc. There's not enough time in a day to finish all the tasks!"
good,"I enjoy the idea of what publix wants to be and what I think the original CEO and creator of publix wanted. But it's such a hard company to progress in, and the work environment with the lack of communication is difficult to tolerate."
good,"Management favors the people who have been their longer than other employees.  I was being harassed by an employee who had been there since 1999.  He verbally assaulted me in front of customers and would throw things at me throughout the day.  When I told my managers, I was told to just ignore it."
good,"I enjoyed working there at first, my managment was fantastic, my coworkers were enjoyable to be around, it was awesome.  However once management switched everything changed.  Now, I hate going into work, the management are nit picky and micromanage literally every single thing we do, and my hours have been cut to 3-6 hours per week.  As a company Publix is amazing, but my store was beginning to break away from the ""Publix Way"" with their associates."
good,Publix is a good place to work to have as a first job but you really have to work for a few years to actually gain any benefits for the company . The customers are really spoiled with all the coupons they get & the bogos & the publix promise is abused .
good,"If you are a single parent, and an only parent, who needs certain days/nights off, and you want to make full time status, this is not the job for you. I was with the company for seven years, and only advanced $4 in pay."
good,"I started out as a bagger and told them I wanted to become a cashier. A few months later they gave me cashier numbers and I was never scheduled to be a cashier and only jumped on when they were slammed. Management was incredibly racist and petty, When I turned in my 2 weeks notice, they stopped scheduling me and locked me out of my account."
good,"Publix is a good start for young adults learning work ethic and responsibility. Or, for retirees who want to get out of the house and occupy their time. Any one ambitious, and don't require to be told what to do, or is accustomed to being trusted to know the right and proper thing to do to resolve issues and support customer's would find this job limiting."
good,"Was a great company to work for and great co-workers. Other than  the DM coming in frequently to terrorize the place, it was a great working environment. Just couldn't get enough hours."
good,Too many bosses not enough cooks full time associates are supposed to train the new hires but new hires train new hires instead. Because of computer program associates are not allowed any extra hours needed for insurance.
good,"Unless you wanna stick it out and are not bothered by a stressful environment, then its an ok company to stay with. but other than that, and it depends more on the store, location, and management, its tough to move up through the company to make any real money so that you can live on your own. Its politics. It's who you know, not how hard you work; which is sad but true."
good,"My experience wasn't great with Publix.  I worked for them for 11 years before I was promoted and had previous management experience.  They have a testing process, which I passed numerous times.  In the district in which I worked there was a lot of nepotism and it was about who management likes and also a lot of immoral things happening.  Once in management I saw and heard a lot of things I didn't like.  I asked to transfer out of the store and was told I couldn't because their weren't any openings. So I asked to move into another district and was told the same so I chose to resign. My biggest issue is that it was not an even playing field.  Some managers were held to higher standards than others.  I worked 50 to 60 hr work weeks because of the high volume in my department.  I actually worked 70 hrs one week. Reflects last store."
good,It is a hard days work. It is a very busy place and you always have lines at your register. There is never enough managemtn around when you need help. The customers at my store were not nice.
good,Long time associate of publix. benefits are great but the promotion system is backwards. I have been promotion eligible for almost 3 years now and have been passed over multiple times with no explanation or reasoning. also this company brings people on as full time even though they say they wont and they usually pay new associates at as much as ones with 5 or more years of service. Multiple years of service is a waste of time when you are paid the same as new employees.
good,Basic. Seemed more like a force vs a choice when wanting to help the company. Really pressed and tense. It had great benefits but the hourly was hard to gain.
good,"lots of customer demands help in the bakery even when they do know know what they want, be prepared to drop what your doing often to assist customers,"
good,"Publix is difficult to advance in. The company is all around good. It is a decent place if you want to have a part time job. it is difficult to get full time and difficult to advance. As a single mother, it is not a good place as a part time employee."
good,A typical day at publix is where you walk in clock in and be ready to work. I have work at publix for three years I feel like they can get manager with better attitudes
good,"While publix is not a bad place to work at, it is unfortunately filled with a lot of managers who do nothing but sit and not be leaders. A lot of the people you work with are always really cool and the employees are always willing to help each other out. Management can be horrible at times and to the point where they will tell you are just a number and can be replaced. It's fine for a part time job but only for a short while."
good,Its a good place to be if your single and have nothing else to do. You will work all the time even off the clock even tho they say its not allowed but EVERY ONE does it and Managers will hold it against you if you don't even tho they say they don't. Its a sweet shop behind close Doors but they have all the right rules that not even the managers follow unless someone comes asking.
good,Publix is okay. Management can be lazy and unfair but I’ve moved stores recently and my new management team is great. Just depends on which store you are at.
good,"I worked for 3 years at Publix.  I started out as an intern with pay, then as time went on, I obtained a part-time position.  As time went by, my school schedule began to change and Publix was not willing to work around that schedule or my schedule at my second position as a line and prep cook for Levy Restaurants.  "
good,I enjoyed working at publix however I didn't like the fact that i was scheduled to work til 10:00 and would often if not always get out 2 or 3 hours later than what i was scheduled .
good,"Best part is meeting customers from all over the world. Fun job if you are a people person."
good,"Great customer service, stock is easy to find. Workers willing to help when needed. Workers ask if you need any help regularly. Customers are generally happy with service."
good,Bad management
good,"When I worked in Montgomery it was hard, but good work. The managers appreciated everything we did and they understood that we are humans and have limits to how much we can do in our allotted work time. In Montgomery there were slight issues with management, but they did pretty good overall. I typically worked 30-40 hours a week even though I was part time. When I moved to Columbus my working environment changed drastically to 16 or less hours a week with double the work load for the same position. In my new store it does not seem that managers care about our physical or mental health but only on numbers. One last thing was that when I moved to my new store I was promised many things and it has been over three months and the working conditions are just getting worse and worse as time goes on and all things promised are not happening and will not be happening according to management."
good,"I worked here for two years. I loved the staff and management, but working almost full time, for little pay and no benefits was tiresome. It's a very competitive company to work for, I was very lucky I was able to start working on a promotion that would take six months to accomplish but once I got to month 11, I realized how much harder it was going to be to further my career there. I highly recommend Publix as a first time job, but if you want to go into management, just know it's a veeery long ways down the road."
good,Enjoy the job the promotions are very political hard will get you only so far with this company  The company has given me opportunities and I have made friends but overall we are a business and great leaders have been lost due to political and doing favors to individual s who do not deserve the position. Not enough praise goes to associates you must remember people have feelings and a thank you goes a long way !
good,"Its run by the people that never could just make it to college, and all the people under them are the people that are currently going to college. Intern Management tends to be dumber than the actual work force."
good,"Management change often and inconsistent. "
good,"While working there would be no different from the average retail store, with some hardships coming down from corporate decision, the workplace was made nice among the associates, but not by the management. The hardest part was how hard the management would come down on the full time and part time associates, even when it did not call for it."
good,"Good place to work, you will be doing a lot of different things, so long as you don't have a desire to go into management you will be good. The culture of Publix has changed over the past few years and not for the best, it is harder to get the benefits and the management has changed as well. The people who work here are always friendly and you will develop your communication skills."
good,Perfect for a high school student just looking to make some spending money. I would not recommend this position for anyone trying to support a family. Stores would hire more employees instead of giving more hours to current employees.
good,"The first store I work at was great. I loved my managers and they were willing to work with you and help you any way they could. The overall atmosphere was pleasant. That store had a different District and Regional manager than the last store I worked at, so that could be the reason why I did not care for my last store. My direct managers were not easy to work with. They did not care about me as a person, only about what I could do for them to make them look good. They only came on the front end when we had company. They targeted the ones that they didn't care for and made them not like their job to the point that many left or moved departments. It was like a revolving door. It became hard to keep up with new employees because many did not stay long enough to know them. It was very hard to try other departments because they did not want to lose good workers. I felt stifled and overworked. I got flack for taking off some weekends, even with vacation hours. I didn't receive hardly any recognition even when getting customer compliments. They were stingy with My Publix, My Part cards. Even if a customer complimented me directly to the store manager I didn't receive anything, not even a ""Good Job"". It was easy to become unmotivated because it felt like they didn't care about you doing the best work you could do. I had so many responsibilities because I was good at what I did. So i felt like no one else had to work as hard. My work ethic was my pride and joy but even that started to suffer towards the end because my managers would attack me for wanting to go to church or having to"
good,The work environment is like a family. Everyone works together cohesively as a team to help each other. Customer service is exceptional. Flexible with schedules.
good,Publix is a fast pace environment but they do not offer many hours for employees. Publix also does not offer many full-time positions or benefits. Not many advancement opportunities at Publix.
good,"Not meaning heavy by weight, I mean by having more to do than you can handle. The location I work at specifically is organized chaos in the back room. My coworkers make this job fun and somewhat relaxing. Management is not the best, but they “get the job done”."
good,They took away all the things that make staying there for years beneficial. Expanding so fast that all the good managers leave for the bonuses and those that are promoted in their spots are not ready.
good,I learned with this company that with great power comes great responsibility. Seeing old neighbors or friends as a customer was exciting and fun. This environment is truly a place of learning how to float or sink.
good,"Publix use to have a profit share plan with all employees, after working with the company one year. They implement a new plan which eliminated the profit share but increased non-management hourly wages.  Three months after this plan was put in place, Publix reduced all hourly employees working hours and eliminated overtime. This helped raise profits for management, and reduced the pay for everyone else."
good,Publix is an amazing place to work. I would work there forever if I didn't have a need for a set schedule. They are a great place for college students in need of flexible hours.
good,its an ok job but not something I would want to make a career out of. it can be stressful a little overbearing and sleep may be hard to enjoy knowing you have to wake up in a few hours.
good,The job is good when you have the right team and people pushing you in the right management. Have to be a team player and can't go anywhere without that.
good,"Good Company until executive staff changed. A new Chief Information Officer (CIO) was brought in from outside and immediately ended all contact positions, which I was one."
good,"I did everything I could including moving several states and spending all my time developing myself and learning to grow in my career. When I moved  or when I even changed stores it became evident that none of my previous experience or record from working in the same company, and that was documented and available to any one of my managers, meant anything. The company functions like it's unionized. You get on the escalator and you wait till you get to the top. It's about time in and who you know. If you are young and don't want to make any waves in life then this is the company for you. You will be well compensated after you grind out your 40 years of service."
good,Well Publix is a good job to work at. Bad part is that you have to work there for a year to get they benefits. Every body has an opinion..............
good,"Our store gets very busy in the villages, on 466A . Its the busiest one which is great! Not the greatest store to work at because the store management are pretty good but, don't think the front end managers that we have had and have now are that good. Lots of reasons why as to not having team leaders that know what they are doing. Too many favorites. But there are plenty more..... Dont want to put in here for many people to read...."
good,"Quick pace environment, Co-workers are great and help the day go by, Management just doesn't listen to its workers when it come to scheduling, Publix is on its time not yours."
good,the management showed favoritism. good hours. they have flexible schedules. you can put in for any day off in advance and get off. flexible with calling out sick.
good,Doesn't matter how hard you work if your not friends with the bakery manager you don't get anywhere. Manager doesn't come to you and let you know what you are doing wrong she goes to everybody else and talks behind your back
good,"Very stressful and monotonous, however, if you are part-time, they are very flexible with your schedule. Great temporary job, or full-time job. Good advancement opportunities. Managers can be awful and very corrupt."
good,"I work in the Deli and it can be very hectic and stressful because we are constantly understaffed. This job is great for anyone looking for a part time job or a side job to help supplement their income, but it is practically impossible for a regular full time employee to make enough money to live off of. The only way to make a decent living working in the retail Publix environment is to be in management. The problem with this is that Publix rarely seems to promote the people who most deserve it. Aside from this, the benefits that Publix offers its employees are very nice."
good,"This is a good place for thise who already have a family member or two within the business.  This is totally the type of job where it's not what you know, but who you know.  Either you kiss up to get ahead or you have someone there in the position to put you ahead.  I've worked at three different stores and it's always the same thing.  Just all politics.  The people you work with are mostly pleasant.  But there are just so many managers that quite simply, can't manage.  Plus you get blamed for not getting things done when being clearly shorthanded as far as manpower."
good,"Has room for advancement.   And if you show up and do your job and take a little pride in it, it goes a long way. They management is as fair as they can be in a retail environment, but communication is not always the best."
good,"Working at Publix is like being a part of the family, everyone there has your back, The work is decent and hours are competitive, not much else to say"
good,Publix has financial pay off if you make it into management. Work life balance needs improvement on the retail side of business. There are pros and cons to every business. Job stability would be the pro.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that I am helping customers out, and giving them a quality service. I feel that there is a lot to gain as a person from working at Publix."
good,"Publix was a good place to work, it just was not very work/life balanced. It was very hard to get off if needed and the raises were not very good for the work done."
good,"A typical day as the main and only Kitchen workers for the Deli, id clean and cook as much as i can through out the day, doing a two man job as one person, then when it comes time to start breaking down my equipment and clean my area, i fry as much as possible that will not exceed the amount which would be considered 'too much' ill spend 3 hours just cleaning and assisting customers and when i would finish my area, I'd be ahead enough before the store closed to help everyone else close their sections and that would usually get every one out on time."
good,"After they lost the ""Jenkins Spirit"" and work ethnics things began to slide both quality of products as well as employees treatment. Several friends were seriously injured working here and they just don't care about the employees after. Fighting them for simple medical treatments even with proven injuries"
good,They pick and choose carefully who they want to advance.  Its difficult to get full time position unless you get into management. I worked toward full time and couldn't get it.  Low pay for the work you are asked to do.
good,"Have worked here for 4 years and there has been a big difference. It has become all about work. There are no hours to allow for the proper number of workers. Any problems are handled as ""it's like that at every store"". Most managers are just there for the paycheck and don't care about the employees. If a manager is good, they just get moved around and are never promoted above their department level. The culture has been lost to make the corporate bosses richer."
good,"My typical day at work would be very busy. I learned  a lot about team work . I learned and built great customer service skills. I learned how to communicate better."
good,Great company for customers. Not so great for workers. Been here for 5 years and I don't make enough to live on. Sometimes managers expect too much for such a low pay.
good,"This company does not care about you or your family. If you go into management, be prepared to work 60+ hours without overtime. Communication between upper management and lower staff fails completely. Training is nothing more than going into a room and clicking a computer screen. On the job training is at a minimum. Benefits are good though. You get stock just for working there. Insurance available for part time employees."
good,Not much to say.....you get on the job training for what u apply for... you learn different things...you get to learn the products and how they are made.. I did not know a lot of the products are made at the warehouse and it arrives at the store frozen....when it gets to the bakery all that is done it gets taken out of the box and into the oven
good,"Depends what you do and where,some managers are nice and want to have nice place for work,some are really mean.From 2000 to 2005 was really good company and then they started changing rules and stop treating employees as people."
good,As an employee of Publix I enjoy working in the upbeat environment but being part time benefits are not lucrative and pay is minimal. The best part about working there is the opportunity to become a stock holder but being part time you have to work there at lwast three years brfore that is possible.
good,"The job was enjoyable at times when I interact with nice customers and my manager was very nice and made me want to work hard. The  main problem with the job was the new management that worked everyone too hard for no reason and made employees responsible for too many assignments, this made the flow of work difficult and overloading."
good,"Load floater, stock shelves, assist customers. Was not micro-managed.  Assisted customers with carry-out services. Met some interesting customers."
good,"""Publix is a great company"" they said. Just like everything it starts off great, until a year later after helping in other departments picking up the slack your manager decides to cut your hours from 32 a week to 15. It's not a horrible company, but the hoopla about it doesn't match what's actually taking place on the inside. Favoritism runs rampant inside the walls of Publix. A typical work day for me depended on what department I was scheduled in that day. The meat department was smooth sailing, thanks to the manager over it. Customer service on the other hand was always spasmodic (customers and staff alike). There was drama, there was just unnecessary confusion going on within the staff. There were also a couple of managers who were just outright cold and uninviting. Although my experience at Publix wasn't the greatest I did learn things. I was taught different cuts of meat, which is pretty cool. Working on the cash register forced me to further my mental math skills, pretty imperative skillset to have. And most importantly I had to teach myself how to be patient; especially dealing with irate customers. "
good,I typically go in at 4 am and dont leave there until 8 pm.  I am running the whole time and usually cant even take my lunch break.  I am unable to hire full time employees in order to assist with the work load so I have to do everything myselft
good,"You're encouraged to have teamwork but that rarely happens.  Associates like to argue and start drama.  The company has great benefits but you have to work extremely hard to get anywhere in the company.  Most new hires only get hired part time and you have to know someone ""special"" in the company to want to move you to full time position let alone promote to a management position.  Overall a great beginning job for a student or first job for a teen or young adult to learn to have a good work ethic."
good,the pay is low. Managers have favorites. nearly not enough hours for benefits. Good starter job. Trying to get full time is miserable. Guest take advantage of policies.
good,A typical day of work consisted of 9 to 10 hours of work with very little appreciation or credit even when going above and beyond. Management is generally a revolving door do to rotations and promotions. Direct managers were actually quite good however my experience with upper management was less than ideal. Often they would make decisions with out knowledge of how that would affect the regular work day and then counter act those decisions after seeing their mistake yet blame you the part time or full time worker. Coworkers however were great and really created a fun environment both in and out of work. While the job was not excessively hard the compensation for this job was not nearly equal to what was expected of you on a daily basis.
good,"I worked at Publix for eight months in 2011. A typical day consisted of bagging groceries, assisting customers to their cars, and collecting carts. I learned to look for tasks to do to stay busy on the job. There is always something to do."
good,"overall a great place to work, great benefits and flexible hours for part timers. need open availability for full time, nights and weekends. opportunity to move up in company."
good,"The hours on the stock crew were typically 2am until whenever your team lead let you leave (sometimes 4pm or 5pm). Unless you caught ""Green Fever"", then it was just another job. But for the employees that loved Publix, loved their jobs."
good,This company used to be a good place to work for. Over the years it has changed. All they care is about saving time and money and its no longer about the customers or workers. They say to give 100 percent customer service but when you go there trust me those smiles are fake.
good,"I learned an incredible amount of information working in the Publix Pharmacy. I enjoy being around my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my day is resolving complications with insurance claims and interpreting prescriptions. Also, the great relationships I have built with customers."
good,I learned a lot about how to work hard and please the customer. The tools I received help me to stand out in any workplace as a great worker.
good,"A typical day at publix SHOULD be very easy as the actual job itself in any area ( besides deli ) is pretty straightforward and easy. Stock shelves, help customers , etc . More often than not there is inadequate staffing ( like every other place nowadays ) so getting your work done can be sometimes very difficult. The culture at publix really is a put the company before all else type mindset. Management is required to be there so much it feels like they want everyone to be in the same situation as well. Scheduling is simply awful as it is computer generated and it's all over the place. Many times working an 11 hour day ( 12pm-11pm ) and having to be there to open the next day at 5am.  If you point that type of scheduling out to management they will look at you with that ""ok so what's the problem "" look. If you have a family or value your personal time I would highly suggest you look elsewhere to work. Management is hired from within which is good and bad. If you want to put MANY years in and if you are lucky enough to be the right person at the right time way down the road , you MAY have a chance. If your over 30 don't even think it's gonna happen. Full time is near impossible to attain as they have people scheduled often between 30- 38 hours a week keeping you right under the cusp of any benefits or the ""full time"" title. Also many ( not all ) managers have worked from the bottom up and put in well over 10 years time to achieve this feel as though it's no longer their job to do anything at all. If I'm scheduled for 8 hours at the same time my manager is , if I see him for 2"
good,"Publix is an awesome place for customers to shop. They treat their customers like royalty. As for the employees... they are treated like second class citizens, but with good pay for a full-time employee. I am currently looking for a new job because I was hit with the old bait and switch. I was leading to believe that this was a family environment, and everyone helped everyone. I learned quickly that management was not that approachable. The employees really wear a mask for customers. Behind the scene employees are miserable. I thought it was just me, but I watched and listened to other employees and they feel the same way I feel."
good,Hardest part of the job is the co workers and management and don't expect much of life outside work. The most enjoyable part of the job is from time to time you will actually be able to do your job with management breathing down your neck.
good,it is very busy at time co worker don't always work as a team it is hard to move to different position at time it was hard to work with other co-works and some of the mangers are fun to work with
good,Nice place to work. Getting hours is never a problem with kids that do not want to work. It is always busy. Great second job!
good,"helping customers find what they need and help them with money service. Scanning the customers orders, helping them bring into the cars."
good,"Publix is decent. You have a lot of time on your feet. I was in the deli and it is definitely hard. People can be nasty and management changes over there like crazy. I worked for an awesome store managers although my deli manager was not the best, he played favorites."
good,I would make sure the products were on the shelves properly with product according to date. I made sure each customer was assisted  and taken care of. I enjoyed being able to work in a team and being able to finish together.
good,"This is an adequate job if you can get into a good store, when you have nothing else to focus on, and you know people. The company is willing to work with scheduling especially in regards to your education, but at the cost of severely cut hours. Attending school while working at my most recent store, I often only worked 8-16 hours per week even with a fairly open availability with night classes. Due to Publix's quality and prices, a lot of high end customers shop there and have no qualms with being ruthless and hateful to the employees, even towards teenagers. What's worse is sometimes management will unintentionally encourage that bad behavior by trying to make the customer's shopping experience better, and rewarding their bad behavior. Job security is great, but knowing someone and devotion only to Publix is what moves you up on the ladder. Though I had some great managers, many managers have a habit of playing favorites and ""buddying"" up with their subordinates to the extent of social engagement outside of work."
good,I've worked at publix for 8 years have not been promoted yet from bagger and im still there as a bagger. Have tried to go for full time have yet to be promoted.
good,"They seem to pick favorites and those are the people who are guaranteed hours. They act like they care about your well being but as it turns out, that is not so true. There was lots of drama between coworkers."
good,"I would say that Publix is a great place to work for, but you have to be there to really learn, and to enjoy your work environment.  I am a pharmacy Tech @ Publix, and I was hired in as part time.  The sad part is that our store hours had been cut so bad, that I have gone weeks without working at all!  I was hired in to get at least 15 hours per week, but I have never worked those hours since I was hired. I have learned a lot, but its sad that I cant learn more since I cant get any hours."
good,A typical day consists of selecting orders and placing them on a pallet to be prepared for shipping. Management lacked a sense of respect for the individual.  Hardest part of the job was the physical aspect. Most enjoyable was the pay.
good,The main responsibility of my position is providing excellent customer service and maintaining a balanced till. I learn the best and most effective way to interact with a wide variety of customers. My co workers are pleasant to work with and i work well with my customer service manager. My favorite part of my job is working with pleasant customers.
good,In the morning we would all drink coffee talk about what we did the on our day off. Then we would do the reworks of the wet meat tray .After that we would take at look at what was need in the meat and start cutting.
good,"Mr. George would very disappointed,his vision has become a nightmare for employees. "
good,"Over time, Publix has reduced in the warmth and team spirit that had made its pharmacy stand out from the others.  The only reinforcement is negative, purses must be small and clear, sneezes are written up.  "
good,"*Working at Publix will be busy at open then slow at 10 am, pick back up at 11-1:30pm, and you will have down time until the dinner rush/traffic rush comes about 5:00pm"
good,Management needs structure. In my department we never have the tools needed to complete the taste to do our job and then we get in trouble when it isn't finished. We can't do our part if our managers don't do theirs.
good,"Publix Supermarkets says they do all of these really amazing things, that is until you are an employee. I did learn a great deal while working there, though."
good,"Management was very distant, only came to you when they needed something. Co-workers just came to work and go home not much socializing while working. Good advancement opportunities if you want it, and good raises every 3 months."
good,"Management poorly organized"
good,Just your average supermarket chain. They didn't listen to their employee's and managers just sat around all day with their favorites and people that i worked with there were on the most part mean.
good,"Fun place to work, beginning the day with checking register, stocking and making sure area is clean."
good,Great all around company to work for benefit wise. But management and human resources is a joke. Nobody has the slightest idea on how to do anything. My advise get what you can out of them and keep it moving.
good,"Cashier"
good,"Very clean. Friendly. Very green.  Very strict rules.  Very busy, alot of management. The job is not a hard job. I have learned alot since I started there. "
good,Management is clueless. No room for advancement. Too much work and not enough time. Not enough pay for what we do.
good,They will take all of your free time..... no time for yourself
good,"Opening the deli department, I learn that its take team work to runn a department. Management is ok to work with, co-workers were ok to work with some of them. hardest part of the job, is going to work for a few hours The most enjoyable part of the job is when it was time to go home."
good,Days at work were very busy with not enough staff to help. I did learn a lot about customer service and working well with others. The management was not very fair and a lot of favortism went on. I have no complaints about the people I worked with. The hardest part of the job was trying to do what I had to do with not enough help. The most enjoyable part of my job was my coworkers.
good,"Publix is not somewhere I would want to spend my life working. It seems like the people in lower management are all internally miserable. Not to mention, they are stuck. They have so much time invested that they cannot leave but they will never advance any further. Work days seem to drag on. Part-timers are under-appreciated."
good,When I first started working for the company they were so family oridnated and very professonal as well and that along made me want to be a part of the company and grow in it. I start as a cashier and in 15 years I was head cashier and moving toward Management. However the company started changed and started caring less about their employees and that really hurt.
good,"The store I work in is very very.. Frugal. The only people who are able to get full-time employment were transfered from another store where they were full-time. This store is very stingy on hours and the managment has very little care about you, the individual. Many of my co-workers are retirement age, and no matter what, they cannot get enough hours to get the health benefits they need. One woman was 5 hours away from the required hours. And you bet they did that on purpose!"
good,I like working with my co-workers and enjoy helping people anwering there questions.
good,"Working there is good overall, but I think better management is needed. I have had to deal with alot as an employee that I should not have to deal with."
good,"The workplace culture is average, and for the most pRt people get along. Mostly management was an issue. Some managers were great, others were very rude and bossy and didn’t do their job themselves."
good,"Very good job benefits,including stock ,health insurance,dental etc. Could have bette leadership in certain roles. But overall an ok place to work for!"
good,Publix is not the place to work if you are looking for a full time job providing you with many hours. The Publix I work at hires to many employees and because of that front service clerks get no lore than 20 hours a week. They are more focused on the customers happiness then trying to help you advance in the company.
good,"Publix was my first job but now that I look back at what other jobs offer in my opinion Publix is not the right place for me. The managers were good however, the other employees, lets just say there was more to be desired. Overall I didn't mind working at Publix but there were no benefits as a part -timer and it's practically impossible to go full-time even working there for some employees I knew that were working 5+ years."
good,This was my first real job in the customer service field. Worked with a few great people and learned a lot from them. Realized a lot about leadership skills from this place on what to be like and not to be like. IT usually busy on the weekends and at 5 when people are getting off of work.
good,The Publix sight I worked at was an extremely high volume store. The work past was fast and intense but everyone worked at as a team and got everything done every day.
good,If you looking to move up quickly this is not the place for you  you will be promised a promotion and then be constantly told just a week more just a week more until it’s been over a year and you still haven’t had a promotion
good,Don’t work here it really sucks. Management sucks and everyone you work with sucks. U get a .25 raise every 6 months. So that means you get .50 raise a year
good,Grass is not always greener when moving to a new store. Just gotta learn to adapt to the new surroundings and make sure you can stay in the good graces of management.
good,The management at Publix could be better. The hardest part of the job is when everyone comes up to you at once but that's the part that makes the day goes by fast. The most enjoyable part of the day is when everyone works together as team instead one person doing everything.
good,This is a great place to work for a first job. The issue with publix in the long term is it's hard to get full-time and to even get part-time benefits you have to work hours close to that of a full-timer. Although because of this company I got the chance to polish my work ethic to a whole new level.
good,"The management in every department I worked in was terrible and encouraged those who were known to be bad at their job over those who worked hard and properly.  You have to really know people and have your nose up the rearof someone big if you want any advancement.  Whatever goals you THINK you have, drop them.  You'll die here in the same position you started in."
good,Publix is a good place to start working while you are in high school or getting an associate. Group work is always there and good customer service and always being the best in the supermarkets world
good,Good people  but lots backstab  very competitive the benefits  that they have there once u been there awhile is quite good it is somewhat worth it in long run
good,"Publix isnt what it seems, mnagers hold down those trying to grow and force others out. They look to only help friends. They tax your pay an extra 33% as well. There's no room for a life. All the male managers are balding from stress and all the female managers are divorced. Both sets are drunks."
good,It a good place to work. It's difficult to promote as immigrant even though with proper qualification. Safety and quality are very important. Before starting to work these two topics have to discuss about.
good,Publix is where shopping is a pleasure but working in the Deli is not. Higher up management makes the job miserable the longer you are there with how many rules and regulations they continuously change. It's a good pay check but there is no set schedule for full time because they want your availability open. No work and life balance. You can work anywhere from 530 am to midnight. Only been here for 2 years and already have stock though and the benefits are amazing. I work at the second busiest store in my district and the customers can complain about anything and anyone and you'll be the one in the wrong. Customers are always right.
good,"they're still in the good old boys network, check how much female and others against caucasian, enough said, as their team song goes different strokes for different folkes"
good,"I had fun working for Publix it had good people and almost everyone in the departments got along. the only thing I had a problem with was management, they kept on switching management."
good,"Providing customer service by scanning customer's groceries, bagging their groceries, taking them outside to their car and keeping my work area clean. I am also a team player and get a long with all my employees."
good,"Good place to work when starting out with a first job. I did not like any of my superiors until right before I had to leave due to personal reasons. I felt as though some of the management felt like they are better than certain employees and picked favorites. By the time I had to leave, my management team was amazing and cared for ALL of their employees."
good,"Worked there for more than a year. Have never spent a single day trying any less than my best. Was consistently recognized as the ""model of customer service"" by multiple managers, i don't see any future with this company. I haven't been genuinely recognized for my consistent hard work, I've asked for movement around the store. I've asked for a transfer. I've been denied leadership roles. and advancement in a career. Was a really stressful non rewarding way to make a starting 12$ an hour. +no consistent schedules so prepare to live your life around your 'part time' 39.9 hour a week job."
good,I worked here when I was in highschool and I rarely got hours more than 20 and i had to do most of the closing duties like cleaning the restroom and what not but i only applied as a bagger/cashier.
good,"I've had friends that have worked at Publix and absolutely loved the company; I, unfortunately, did not have this experience. Which location you decide to spend your time at really shapes your perspective of the company and its motto. During training, I had a glorified gold standard of Publix and its endeavors stamped into my mind. When actually working there, I was gravely disappointed. I lived in a college city but unfortunately worked at a Publix that was downtown; the average cycle of replacements for the management team was every 3-6 months and I worked once a month during summers because I had a large commute when away from university. Every single time I came back to work, I had a different supervisor. I received my last evaluation from a manager I had never met before; I met him the day I was to receive my eval (after having driven there for an hour) and he didn't even know who I was. The Publix you work at is really what matters-- corporate only checks up on its stores in 6-mo intervals. Keep that in mind."
good,"Not the best but not the worst. Pay isn't too bad, but the environment is hectic and stressful. Not for those who want to keep their sanity or faith in humanity"
good,"They have great benefits, could stand to give better raises and most of there managers need to be replaced due to not qualified, treat people differently, definitely show favoritism. Seem to get rid of the good workers and keep the slackers.Not all that its cracked up to be"
good,The most enjoyable part of working for Publix is meeting customers and helping them out with what they need. Always make the grocery store experience enjoyable for the customer while they are shopping at Publix.
good,"I remember when publix was so family oriented. It isn’t so much anymore. The company takes great care of its employees. However, the hours are tough if you have kids."
good,Publix is for people who has no bills to pay. If you can’t do a closing shift they won’t give you any hrs. There were time I was only getting 4hrs a week all because I told them I couldn’t work past 5pm due to my kids.
good,"I took the job because I needed a job. Not enough hours scheduled. No room for advancement. I like the benefits and would like to start 401k and invest in stock, but I dont get enough hours to be able to afford to do so. Not enough pay."
good,"Publix Inc, apparently has a policy of rotating department managers and assistant managers frequently and each one seemed to have they’re own way of doing things.  This seemed to create confusion between  shifts.  For example, the managers were there during the day shift and explained new procedures to them.  When the night shift came in we had to figure it out for ourselves. This lead confusion and poor customer service at times.  Overall I had a good experience with them and still maintain friendships with my coworkers."
good,"I would never recommend Publix unless you are single and wanting to become management. To advance, Publix would need to be your first marriage and you must do everything you can for them. No work/ life balance. Publix is not what it used to be."
good,Get ready to kiss some butt if you wanna get anywhere in this company. Not worth the time it takes to move up. How good you are at your job does not matter all that much. It is about who you know and what butts you kiss.
good,The culture at Publix has changed. Working there has become more challenging and borderline dangerous with less and less rewards. k The pay is not competitive compared to the workload.
good,"Typical work day depends on the day of the week. Some days there are more things to do like re-packs and changing out specials. Other days there are less things to do and it feels like management struggles to find and tell me what I should be doing. When the store is busy it is stressful. Publix has the habit of having conflicting work culture and policies. They want you to juggle many things at once but also be fast about it. You are supposed to stop and always take a customer exactly where an item is, but also you should finish truck quickly. So if you have an ""unlucky"" day where you get asked 10 questions in a row, you are blamed for being slow. This happens all the time. You are also supposed to cycle older items to the front of the shelf  every single time you stock, which makes sense, but because you are pressured to finish a certain amount of truck in a certain amount of time, cycling every single item becomes virtually impossible.  "
good,"My experience at publix is a pleasant one. I like getting paid every week, I like the 401k and stock programs. The managers are fair. I enjoy the work"
good,"Don't work at Publix unless you are willing to live for them. Nepotism is a big problem in the company as well, and don't work here unless it's at corporate or warehouse level. The store level is a waste of time entirely. If you don't come in every time they call, you will find yourself making next to no money as they attempt to make you quit instead of just firing you."
good,publix is a good place for a first job and to gain an understanding of a work environment that being said though i would not see a long term career unless you get into the managers favorite employees. extreme favoritism is shown
good,First experience working at Publix was great! Second time much has changed. I was part time and got few hours. No benefits such as health insurance. The management was okay but it was hard to get questions answered. Never heard a good comment from anyone no matter how hard you worked but criticism came constantly. It’s hard do describe the culture but it has changed over the years. I have great memories and miss my job when I first worked for the company but this time around it was honestly a bad experience.
good,"8 hour shifts. One Hour break. Lots of standing and talking to customers. Decent pay. Hive mind managers and cult-like culture. If you're in school and don't mind doing a mundane job, go for it."
good,"The benefits and starting pay are good. It depends on the management though on how smoothly things run there. I was considered part time but I was working almost 40 hours a week. Because things weren't getting done that needed to be done by your co-workers. The management could have helped out a little more. For people that need regular recognition it might not be the place for you. I would wake up and get there at 4 am sometimes 5 am and wouldn't leave until 4 or 5 pm, With no lunch or break. They would tell you that you need to take a lunch but wouldn't give you any relief so that you could. Things are inconsistent from one store to the next. It was very stressful and frustrating to not have a manager that stood behind you and helped when needed. Have plans for weekends and time with your family? Well you can forget about them. Its very hard for you to have a family life if your not management."
good,"It's fine to work. Job has no fixed hours or scheduling, must be patient and have great people skills. New managers are complaining about being overworked but only 5 to 10 hours more per week. Management has some double standards.  Seniority and knowledge doesnt get anyone promoted faster."
good,"this company has great benefits and great opportunities for young adults to be leaders and get great business knowledge, Management can be better it always start from the top."
good,Wish they would give full time to the people that diserves it. There’s people that been working there for years and mostly of them don’t have full time. The good thing of working there that we treated each other like family.
good,Never get recognition and no benefits at all. Definitely should treat their employees better. Too strict on tardiness. They will write you up for being three minutes late. Heartless company.
good,"A typical day cashiering would amount to to five hours or more at a time standing in one place scanning and bagging groceries while interacting directly with consumers. What I learned from that experience is that the sense of isolation at work is much worse when you are surrounded by people constantly, who, by and large, have no interest in interacting with you beyond purchasing their groceries. That said, we were expected to maintain the appearance of happiness with our work constantly and reminded that if we were discovered to not be smiling at any point during the day, it would negatively impact our evaluation (and therefore, our pay). Other ways of flexing on low-level associates dependent upon the income included encouraging investment in the company-owned stock and a pervasive culture of competition over full time positions - full time positions were required for any advancement in the company, and many of the people who had been working there had worked for nearly a decade striving for full time while still stuck in part time, near-minimum wage positions. "
good,"Publix was a good job while I was in high school, but once I got in college it just wasn’t enough money for me. Honestly I feel like everybody has a different work experience with Publix depending on your location. We’re I worked it was a lot of old people who were extremely rude n thought the world revoled around them. Not only that manegment was fake, not understanding what so ever. We got in trouble over the stupidest things. They didn’t want us talking to each other they wanted us to stand in the front of our registeres like soilders. Not only that but they would love to tell you what your not doing and be quick to put you down about something u didn’t do but when you do something good you get no rewards or  reconigtion for it. Overall my three years working there got worse and worse every year..I can gladly say I hated that job.😉"
good,"Coworkers are usually very nice, but the customers always come first over anything. Also, would not suggest if a student in college and looking for a job with benifits. Base pay is $11 an hour for cashiers, but not worth it considering how much you bend over backward to make everyone happy. You only get dental and vision insurance as a part timer even if you've worked there for years. To get free health insurance through obamacare, you'll have to work 25 hours a week to meet the requirment which tanks grades. Also as a cashier you'll have to be a bagger sometimes which has very strict rules and is very physically demanding. You have to be nice and talkative to the customer, while bagging as fast as you can, then grab the persons cart and take two steps forward, say ""I'll follow you to your car"" and if they say no, you follow up with ""It's my pleasure"". Those are actual rules that they have, and if you miss even one of them they get on to you. You have to follow them out to the car and still talk to them (all day in the heat, cold, and rain) and put their things in their car while most stand and watch you without helping. Not only this, but you have to bring back at most 5 shopping carts with you each time, and dodge cars that don't care if they hit you or not. No safety measures are taken to ensure cars see you during the day or night, no reflective vests, nothing. And if you want to wear a jacket in the cold you have to wear a dark colored one, which makes you even harder to see to cars. So, the customers always come first at the expense of the workers sanity."
good,"Publix is a fantastic place to work for if you are a student, high school or college level, as they will cater to your school schedule for your hours. However, if you want to make a career out of this company, I have witnessed time and time again unfair management practices. I have seen people do nothing during their shift and are a complete waste of company resources not get fired because they knew the right person, and seen someone who repeatedly gets costumer compliments not move anywhere in 3 years as new hires come in making the same pay rate  as the 3+ year person working there, thanks to raising the hiring base pay but only compensating current employees by raising them up to the base pay if they don't already make it. I have seen co-workers repeatedly ask for a NAMETAG and not get one after 1 year of working there and asking 5 managers, from department to store manager level, and really just seen a lack of personal care from management. Management will also make you feel like garbage for calling out, even if you have a 103 fever and can't get out of bed let alone work. I have been with great managers in my department (although I chose the store based on the management), but if you want a career here management will change at a location as you wait to move up the ladder, and with poor management comes the lack of respect and reward for doing hard work and lack of discipline for those who aren't doing their part. I wish there was a way to make a case for yourself when you have bad managers without putting an end to your career doing so, instead of toughing it out for years"
good,"This was a very routine job, everyday felt the same.  The managers were not consistent. Some managers were amazing and some very poorly handled the stress of a grocery store."
good,"The deli is fast paced and exciting, while at times can be very frustrating .  It can get so busy that it has brought me to tears.  There is a mandatory break which is needed.  However, my hours flucuate on the whim of management (in my opinion)   It is a hard job and requires both mental and physical stamina."
good,"Too much required, not much given. with constant changes and new standards haphazardly received weekly it seems that the finish line is constantly moving further and further."
good,Publix is a great first time job for high school kids starting out in the world. They're flexible in schedule and do offer occasional coupons such as money off a holiday turkey around thanksgiving or a coupon for free items.
good,"A typical day at Publix is very fast paced and customer oriented.  I learned to balance customer's needs and satisfaction with that of  other job duties.  I learned to balance the cash for the entire store, set up registers and the front office for the day or close the entire office down.  "
good,The work days where to long. I had to stay every day because the store was so busy and we had no help hired in. Getting a truck in almost everday was terrible.
good,"There is no room to advance in a career there. Management is not the best, they are not willing to help you advance or perform well with your tasks. Some co workers are very nice to work with. Seeing the regular customers are a plus to working at Publix because you get to meet people and help make their day. Also meeting new customers and being able to help them and give a good review of Publix is a good feeling."
good,Not too happy poor management and discrimination . Managers show too much favouritism and this is not fair among workers. Good benefits and a good company to work for if they have the right management. I think it's more than passing a managerial test. Everyone could be a manager by passing the test but not a good leader
good,"Most days we are understaffed, overworked, and stressed out. Most of the managers that I work closely with are rude and disrespectful. I have been with the company almost 3 years any nothing has gotten better."
good,New manger doesn't know what she's doing. She gives all the hours to new employees and gives very little to people who have been there longer. Always have to many baggers on schedule so constantly sending people home early even when they only work that one day that week.
good,"Publix prides itself by promoting itself as a company owned by its employees and competitive benefits, which are still competitive in the industry, but are being diminished by growing corporate greed. Managers, GMs, and Corporate are making cuts on benefits such as bonuses and overtime so that more money is put in their pockets. If you plan on advancing you must follow their rules of treating others under you as lesser than equal and using fear tactics to keep employees in line. Outdated rules such as their no facial hair policy hurt employees who have sensitive skin though Publix owned Greenwise stores allow facial hair and some select stores allow it. Publix is good for kids working through school or anyone planning to advance in the steps in the corporate ladder but not as much for their common employee anymore. It is a shame, but they have made it clear that they want to keep this path."
good,"I cook most days that I work, It is pretty easy. On other days I work I do most of the cleaning. Not hard at all. I have to cook the food for the hot bar and put on the rotisserie chicken, as well as slice meat and cheese for the customer. Giving premier quality customer service."
good,"When the deli dept manager isn't  there and its the asst dept manager, it runs smoothly. But when the dept manager is there, its chaotic. The manager has no leadership skills. He does play favorites. "
good,This is a good place to work but it just has poor management that doesn't make it as great as it seems. Also they never have room for full time and treat some bad
good,Publix is fast paced and competitive in the area of IT.  Security Administration is extremely important to Publix IT management.  Publix provides a tuition reimbursement program for associates.
good,I liked working at Publix …..but....there was a low pay wage per hour and there were no paid vacations if you were part time.....the people were nice.....I really didn't have a problem with working there except you couldn't live on what you made there
good,Very bad place to work never would  ever advance me up in the company .always telling you that you do a great job and would be a great bakery manager but never would  move me up and passed the test 3 times. Loved my job and wanted to advance up in the company  loved doing the mixing and baking
good,"This was just not the environment for me. I disliked and felt uncomfortable around some of my coworkers and the uniform was uncomfortable to wear. The shoes I had to wear were uncomfortable for standing all day, and the hours they gave me were inconvenient and didn't line up with what I told them to give me (for personaly reasons.)"
good,Publix is excellent for Students trying to achieve their career goals outside of Publix. The company will work with your ever changing schedule most of the time allowing for the focus to be kept on a Student's studies rather than putting work first. Training is almost 100% based through the computer rather than hands on which doesn't seem to be the best strategy in my opinion. The location that I have experience at has a very strong employee relationship overall which makes the environment more enjoyable.
good,"I learned that responsibility, punctuality and clean appearance are very important aspects to be care and keep it up"
good,Full time employees were not guaranteed close to 49 hours. Part time employees were lucky to receive 20 hours in a week. The management isn't the best. Favoritism is a problem at publix therefore leading to unfair pay raises.
good,"If you still live with your parents and don't need a good enough income to pay bills then this would be a good job for you. If you're trying to make a living off working at Publix, it isn't going to happen."
good,At Publix the customers are the most important. It is very important to have a customer see a smiling face as the first thing they see while walking into Publix. Premier customer service is a must and the customers and great attitudes is what keeps the company going.
good,I enjoyed working for Publix because I got to meet and talk with different people. I got to help people when they needed it and it was a place to learn how to communicate with customers and co-workers and supervisors.
good,"Fast paced work environment. There is room for advancement, but it can be hard balancing work life with your personal life especially if you have a young child or young children."
good,"A lot of stress with no pay raises. This could go on for many years if you are at the top of your scale. Your only reward is ""you have a job"". Some employees get away with a lot more than others too."
good,if your not to old than Publix is great . the pay does not compensate for the kind of work that is done and required to do. management is constantly micro managing.
good,You have a very bland work experience focused on stayijng the same while being boring and making you fit in like a sheet of parr on rbe r djwjdneendnxn
good,Publix is a good place to work but it gets boring for me because I like to move around and always be doing something. And would like to do something that I’d be more interested in.
good,"Interactively delivered high quality customer service while providing fresh products and meals in a timely manner, and kept all subareas of the department clean throughout the day. Also teamed with coworkers to meet department goals, stock and merchandise products, and produce grab-n-go items and online orders before scheduled times. And when given responsibility; oversaw procedures in the department during the closing shifts."
good,"Publix can be a great place to work especially with the right manager, but they will push you as much as they can. Raises are based on your performance, but if you switch departments you may end up getting paid less than you deserve."
good,It's really a pretty good place to start your first job or maybe if you have the experience apply for a higher pay position but if you have a manager that overlooks your hard work or chooses people up for promotion based on emotions then get out asap or move to another store.
good,It really depends on the Publix you work at. Because I worked at the deli I did not feel like the pay was enough for all the stress you have to deal with.
good,"I started working there since I was 15 years old. I stared as a bagger, I used to bag grocery take care of customers and worked my way up to grocery. Furthermore with my work ethics on how fast and accurate I was working they gave me full time. To continue I outwork all the other full times  worker there, there was a team leader job that was open I was there to take, everyone at the store voted for me and say that I was perfect for it."
good,"Publix is a great place to work unless you want to advance in your career.  Helping customers on a daily basis, stocking shelves, ordering product and inventory audits."
good,"Publix is a good jumping off point for any beginner who is curious about what the work force is like. Aside from that, you better find another job because their pay will no longer be cutting it."
good,Its alright I don't recommend young people to consider this job for full time to stressful.the job can be very stressful management is the only one that benefits from this job
good,Publix is a great company to work with great benefits nice people if there's a problem they're quick to get the problem solved  and the best thing about publix customer is when they publix promise
good,"If you get terrible  managers, it can be miserable. I’ve had managers throw things at us(not hit us) in anger. The benefits are pretty good and the pay is okay, good compared to lots of places I’m sure. But they start you out thinking they care about associates and then they become disrespectful and rude. They care more about profit than customers. They really put on this huge facade that they want it to be a pleasure to shop there but they really don’t care. They put getting things done over customer care a lot of times."
good,It is a good store the employees here get along but not a lot of hours. If anyone wanted to be part of the green machines i would tell them its a great place to learn and grow. And gain a better idea on how to get the job done.
good,publix was ok its always busy keep me going management always on ur back but I'm a hard worker like to finish fast ask for something els to be done break time is ok everyone talks eat together
good,Don't like working here. A lot of work is expected of you. You do not get a lot of hours unless you are able to work whenever. It is hard to move up..
good,Working for Publix is all fun at first until you realize you've been in the same position for 3/4 years and yet to get a promotion because it's so hard. This job is all about using people's potentials and get rid or you when you can't work no more. Publix used to be great but no anymore
good,"When I first started working at Publix I was about 18 years old. This was my first job and I was excited to see how publix had in store for me. It was great until management started moving around and we had gotten a new set of managers. As a former empoylee sadly I believe publix has some of the worse management within the company. They never notice the effort you put into assisting a customer and they always complain about the littlest of things. As a former employee we use to get ranked about every 6 months to tell you what you had to improve on. I honestly did good each time. "
good,long hours with a lot of rules in place in environment that goes against the rules itself. If you are good at a job they want to keep you there. Good pay
good,Package and shelf product
good,"Answer phones, Take cake orders, slice bread, package and label all products from baked goods, fill hot pastry cases, check dates scan and pull. Clean all bread slicers, cases and sweep entire bakery. Throw away all dated product at end of day. The hardest part of the job was being in the freezer pulling products daily. The culture is good people doing their very best every day. The  most enjoyable part of my job is that Publix hires very good people and they are a great team."
good,Managers are walking out daily. Depending on whos there that day standard are diffrent. They expect you to get all this work done but don't allow you to be in the office on the computer to get that paperwork done tell you not to get over a certain amount of hours but they need you to come in on your off days
good,"Can be a good place to work with better management.  No team work  from management , manager was barely in the department. The only good thing about my job is  the customers."
good,"I provide premier customer service to every customer that walks in the door, by greeting them with a smile. I am responsible for handling cash, accurately completing Western Union Transactions, check cashing,Lottery and many other tasks that may arise."
good,"The environment was very professional. "
good,"For part-time employees, you can set your own availability and take days off in advance. Both of these are discouraged by management. My store hired an army of part-time workers and scheduled most of them the maximum 35 hours per week, if their availability was open these 35 hours would be spread across every day of the week. "
good,its was a great job to have i loved the clean stores good hours great benifits and health care plan paid vacation fresh produce and who could forget about those great bogo specials
good,A typical day at work at Publix just included dealing with many people and being on your feet in the same spot for hours at a time. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers over small issues. The most enjoyable part is being able to make some people's day just by being nice to them.
good,"Quick paced, stressful environment. Small working spaced, long hours, short breaks, always understaffed, poor training, and poor working conditions. Would not go back."
good,"Great job after you sale out your back and knees. This is a young mans job to get started by selecting, etc. Pay is terrible for the work load and quick pace. Everything is strictly performance based, very hard to move up, good ole boy attitude in management. If you can last long enough to get into a truck then its a little easier. Performance pay system is rigged, you literally have to run 10 hours selecting in order to make percentage."
good,this was a high school job . I worked after I got out of school everyday. Working at Publix was not where I wanted to make my life long career. I had other plans.
good,"Not the best place to work for qualified people, lack of professionalism and minimum to none offers to personal development.  This kind of place is good for young guys as a first employ or for individuals with no life goals"
good,Publix is not a stressful job very relaxed but fast paced. Publix is a great place to work if you are in highschool or for a summer job. The workplace culture is pretty good.The hardest part of being a cashier is selling items  on the side while working. The most enjoyable part of the job are your coworkers and the many faces you meet while working nice customers.
good,"fun place, become a part of a family, learn a lot about yourself and learn how to deal with all sorts of people but crazy hours. Lots of changes and able to move up if you would like."
good,"You're in the weeds from the time you get there until you leave. There is generally more work than there are hours or workers to get the work done. There are no hours available, so you end up working 16 to 20 hours a week. Your best hope is to pick up shifts. There are no breaks, at least in the bakery. You get a 30 or 60 minute lunch, depending on the length of your shift, but there are no breaks otherwise, and you may end up working up to six hours without a break. There was also a lack of training, where management's expectations were much higher than the training that was provided."
good,"everyone friendly, and there's dishonest people trying to get things free., people pretending to be your buddy but not.Always trying to start things, and then deiying that they said that."
good,"The people you work with start to feel like family.  There is always a chance to move up in the company.   You get raises every 6 months, as long as you do well on your evaluation."
good,"Hard work and standing on my feet. Would like to grow bu hard to get up in FT. "
good,"Working at Publix isn't a bad job, but I need something more. Something that pays more, and gives me more hours so I am able to support myself because at the moment I cant. All the employees and store manager are very nice and professional."
good,"Great place to work, slower locations getting busier since recent local pharmacies have been closing in the area. Staff well trained and efficient. Manager seems to care about problems and addresses them quickly."
good,"Publix is a good place to work. The customers are awesome and what I miss most about leaving. The management, however, changes too often and everyone is not on the same page as far as running the store."
good,"A typical day is very routine ... only the day of the week changes.  It's hard to have ""family"".  The schedule is done a weekly basis and it is made available Tuesday for the following week.  You will also  be working every weekend, unless requesting it off for a special event.  Depending on the department you can be scheduled anytime from 4 a.m. to close ... which is typically an hour after the store closes.  Of course,  cliques do form depending on the department and then further cliques within the department. The jobs are not difficult .. it just always seems to be short of staff."
good,"Publix is a strong growing company. However, to advance, much politics involved. If your manager likes you, he will back you up for promotion or advancement no matter how your work is. The opposite holds true, if your a hard worker but your manager doesn't like you, you will never go anyway. No matter how hard you work, it will take years to get promoted if your manager isn't on your side. The people you work with are the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Co-workers are fabulous. Management is inept and at times horribly offensive. I was held back from advancement because my manager didn't like my lifestyle choices and she is a Christian. Store manager is borderline rude 24/7 and terribly impatient. Management has no respect for the legitimacy of mental illnesses.Customers are constantly impatient and rude. If you don't have thick skin, save yourself the stress of this workplace."
good,The company have take off bonuses medical insurance is bad also dental the company needs to be like previous yeras again and return the benefits that they took off
good,"no longer competitive with wages, benefits, or 401k. wish it was still the company it used to be.riding on the reputation built by the practices that have been cast aside long ago. willing to train new hires due to their inability to remain competitive in the market. many gain the experience needed and leave for better wages and benefits. ive by far had worse jobs,  but it isnt what its advertised to be. im thankful for the training ive received. dont go to HR, its risk mitigation more than human resources. Most important they no longer promote from within in most cases."
good,"Great employees and great pay, very high stress and high paced as customers often have complaints that result in getting free product. If you can roll with the punches and focus on getting work done and making sure customers leave happy, then this job is recommended for you."
good,Depending at the store you work at and the mangers you have will make all the difference. I've had good experiences with stores that had motivated and helpful mangers and poor experiences at stores that had less than desirable managers.
good,"It's a great place to go to as a starting job, but moving up and being recognized for your hard efforts is a big struggle. "
good,"not good, closing is hard, not enough hours, hate trying to close then open. managers do not cummicate, my store is way to busy. not trained correctly, not enough empleys"
good,"This was my first job and despite previous reviews about the company I applied for a bagger position while in high school. I quickly became a cashier and from cashier, I moved up to a front office staff trainee. My overall experience at Publix was fine, but I would not recommend working there if your intent is not to move up in the company. Some of the managers at my store would favor one associate over other associates, and there was some prejudice among management."
good,"As far as work/life balance goes, Publix is not the best. Your schedule changes day to day and you don't get your schedule until Tuesday night for that coming Saturday which makes it difficult to schedule plans."
good,"A typical day at work consists of assisting customers in anything they might need regardless of which department youre in. Especially if youre in customer serivice you will be walking all around the store and even outside of the store to go help customers get there groceries inside of their vehicles. Theres not much ive learn as i was a manager at a different retail store and learn most of my knowledge there."
good,Always busy crazy and bad management. No one knew what to do when we got there and everything was unprofessional. Day would start out packing cookies.
good,publix was a good company to work for. it is difficult to advance in the company though. full time positions are scarce and really hard to come by. they offer stock with thee company though which is really beneficial.
good,Though it is a good job to start out through school it is often difficult to move up the ladders despite tenure. Advancement is based more on politics than experience.
good,Great experience with premier customer service. Learned how to deal with many situations and responsibilities with management. very flexible with scheduling while attending school.
good,"your life revolves around their schedule.very fast paced. great benefits. and pay rate.not a lot of diversity at Publix.very stressful at times.wouldn,t reccomend"
good,"I work at a slow store where I barely get 12 hours a week. I want to prosper at Publix, but have not been given the opportunity.  At a different location, I feel I would."
good,"Due to a horrible interaction with the store assistant manager being absolutely inhuman and heartless, I no longer want to work for the company. They care more about hours and dollar signs than your own mental health and family, despite advertising they're all about family. "
good,"It's retail. Good days, bad days. I really believed in what I was doing at the beginning. My spirit was crushed by management to be very honest. It is still a good company to work for but its suffering."
good,It is not a bad company to work for by any means I am just ready to exit the grocery business. I learned how to handle high pressure situations and multi task.
good,"It's a good place to work for only so long, then it becomes pretty bad. Management picks favorites and it's hard to get promoted unless it's your only job."
good,Publix has excellent customer service; it is a clean and organized working environment. I personally enjoy the great customer loving and helpful atmosphere.
good,"Works well with part time employees who aren't looking for many hours. Advancement level- difficult, however there is opportunity. Customers love shopping for Publix. You can gain a lot of knowledge and experience through working with different departments. You learn regulations and standards to ensure you are doing the best job that you can. Can be like a home environment. Every Publix is different and that makes the company unique."
good,"From what I have heard its a great company. I have not yet to see it. There is no set schedule, not a family oriented position. Work hours are all over the place. They start at Part time and it is difficult to get full time. Not easy work, very busy which is a plus."
good,"Expect to stand for a long period of time and occasionally be told to bag/get carts by the team leader or management. "
good,"Publix Supermarkets is a very enjoyable place to work. I enjoy my position and what I do. I have learned quite a bit from working at Publix over the past years about business, retail and most importantly being a leader. My position requires me to lead the way for the entire customer service department."
good,Hard to work there part time. Publix reputation for treating employees well pertains only to full time employees. If you want to be rewarded for hard work look elsewhere. The people that stay with the company the longest are the only ones who get rewarded.
good,It is a great place to start a career. The work load is not hard and the pay is good. benefits are decent if you are able to get full time.
good,I really loved working at publix. I love my coworkers they're great. customer service is #1. no matter what management was never happy with you do ...
good,"It was not a terrible job, but it just didn't feel right for me. It felt as if the managers didn't care for their employees and the benefits weren't not great at all."
good,"Publix's goals and environment is a changing. No breaks and a push for numbers and not enough tech help but that seems to be a retail wide complaint. They don't care about the pharmacist's well-being. They are pushing more programs that are nurse like (i.e.testing for flu/strep, biometric screenings, etc.)."
good,A typical day here at Publix is always a good one. Customers and co-workers mesh pretty well on a day-to-day basis. Team work is at its highest everday.
good,"Working for Publix was my first job after divorcing several years ago and was a way for me to support my younger children at the time, but i had to expand my horizons and find something that would keep the bills paid"
good,"The basic job in and of its self is fine. The office politics and dealing with childish managers who count more on popularity that actually being helpful really dragged down what this job could have been. People who I worked with were more helpful in the short term of the job, yet as time wore on its a good way to start working, bad if this is all your doing in life."
good,"It's alright. It has it's own stresses, mostly couponers who refuse to follow the rules. It's a lot of standing but that's mostly ok. Co-workers are primarily college kids since the store is down the road from the university. This set of management is...vexing to say the least. The store manager bounces between being friendly and disgustingly tactless. The customer service manager while pleasant enough is not all that good at scheduling, she takes more transfers than we have hours for so those of us that have been there for several years get fewer hours. The hardest part I guess is that they bounce between backing their cashiers and caving to rule breakers."
good,"Publix is a great company to work for,in Florida.The company has not been successful in perpetuating its core values north of the home state of Florida.The mission statement does not mesh well with Georgia residents who have worked for our competitors.Human Resources has their hands tied and their heads in the sand.We are more like our competition because they allow associates to perform like they did at another grocery chain.Good ole boy- ism is alive and well.If you want to work at a retail grocery chain you can do worse than publix..but not by much."
good,"Most  of my days were spent stocking, I advanced my knowledge about using a point of sale system while working for Publix among other skills. The coworkers were awesome for the most part, aside from the few in every workplace. I loved helping customers with finding what they needed, it gave me a sense of accomplishment to know I made their day easier. I typically thought of it as ""What if my grandfather, sister, or nephew needed help?"" I hope someone would step up to assist them in ways I helped my customers"
good,Publix needs to hire full time techs!!!!! I have full time bills I can't live off 20 hours a week and keep in mind I work a at very busy store!!!!! I'm looking for another job because they won't let u float to other stores to pick up hours!!!!!
good,"This job is very average. They expect so much from you without fully compensating you for it. The hours are terrible, when you work that is your entire day."
good,"First off, Publix is not a bad company. It's the individual stores and how being an employee is either good or bad. The store I worked only had a bad store manager. Everyone else were excellent co workers."
good,"Trying to find a park, walk in to clock in, speak to everyone, but of course some didn't speak back, control front end, baggers, cashier, phone and custonmers, cash handling, rain checks, western union, money orders and etc"
good,"Publix is a great and fun, working environment; the best part of the day, is interaction with the customers. When they come in, I greet them and make sure each and every customer has found what they are looking for and following the company's motto: ""Where shopping is a pleasure."" With a professional approach, I am able to make a good relationship with customers, making them repeated customers."
good,Not bad but takes a long time make a substantial income. some managers should not be in their positions. management should use their test results to prevent this and to make sure the correct people end up in the correct positions.
good,"There was never really a time to rest other than the slow time around 4:00pm.  I liked working with my colleagues, but I was not fond of my boss."
good,"I loved working for the company itself. However, working in the store was very stressful due to customers. Management was also horrible"
good,I have been there for 4 years they are strict and they are over crowded with employment. I have enjoyed working there but cant wait to change careers.
good,This job is not ideal for people on a tight budget. The hours vary from 10 - 30 hours a week. Not set schedule. They will put you all over the place. There is great oppurtunity for advancement but you must be willing to work many long years to get it.
good,"I learned a lot of from this company. I started as a distribution operator ( clerical ) for at least 8 months. It was long hours and a lot of just sit and wait. Than I moved into receiving which is known as a receiver. It was a very interesting job, I did a lot of cross training in which, inventory, forklift driver, cherry picks, returns and etc."
good,"Though the workplace is not a horrible one, effective communication and leadership are highly lacking. Too many fellow staff members seem to have no desire to work on a team, and management is hardly visible outside extremely busy days. Schedules are inconsistent when first starting, and organization and training are learned as one continues to work there rather than an official ""training day"" be implemented. Overall it is a difficult job to progress in and get used to, and an ideology of ""sink or swim"" seems to be the motivation for management."
good,Publix is a good paying company but not  very flexible. Its good for someone young without a family not needing flexible scheduling. Advancement is very slow and not in a hurry to promote to full time. Publix does not offer good benefits for pt employees not even holiday pay.
good,"Great and fun job to work for, but the management is horrendous. They do not act like actual managers, and do shady in explainable things."
good,"I worked in the Publix on Ocala Corners in Tallahassee (#0782) for a few years. It is a tough and sometimes mundane work environment. Pay is comparatively great for the area however, the hour flexibility is poor; shifts are long and if you request time off for any reason, you will lose many hours in the following weeks."
good,I was taking care of my father who was ill and dying. I took the job at publix because I needed a second income to help support my father. When he passed away I no longer needed the job and I did in fact leave
good,"over all is a good working environment.and I like working there, but I don't like spend my whole weekend working no time to have little bit of fun."
good,"customer service and satisfaction greatly rewarding"
good,"I love Publix. The company is fantastic, and goes above and beyond for their employees. Just don't go to the one I worked for. You'll contemplate quitting, at least 30 times a day. And no, it wasn't even because of the (many) disgruntled customers. It was the managers, who you can be assured, if they're having a bad day, you will too. Do you enjoy feeling replaceable and being told you are replaceable regardless if you do a stellar job or a mediocre one? Work at Publix! Do you enjoy making subs and sandwiches for your customers as roaches scutter across your feet and you can't even flinch or it'll tip off the customer? Work at Publix! Do you enjoy having your workplace fumigated without warning 30 minutes before your store opens? Work at Publix! Do you enjoy working for 9-11 hours a day non-stop with a 30 minute break ALONE while other employees sit and talk casually with the manager for hours on end? Work at Publix! Do you enjoy being fired as an assistant manager for, ""being too nice""? WORK AT PUBLIX! Where shopping, is a pleasure, NOT working."
good,"Publix hires 90% convicted felons to receive state tax credits, however felons can't work at retail locations if they did they would scare all shoppers away, Distro center is the closest to Jail I have ever been."
good,"Long day's no life pay is good,  but basically your whole life will revolve around this place,  how can range anywhere from 8-14 hrs alot of favoritism managers don't know what they doing"
good,"The benefits are great. The job is standard, but the idea of everywhere being the same is a joke. The management isn't the same at all and the idea of being promoted is almost a joke."
good,Graet place to shop for groceries. Pretty good place to learn new things and progress.
good,This company is hard to work for because they change the rules to much.  They had trouble keeping management at first until they made me the manager. my coworkers were good but lazy at times. They want you to work all the time as a manager witch doesn't make time for family.
good,Working at publix was good experience and fun. Customers was friendly ans the associates were too.
good,Publix is an okay starter job. You unload trucks and stock groceries.
good,"Ok benefits, full time is almost a myth, but part time employment get basic benefits."
good,"-I was a bagger, learn how to treat people, the way they deserve."
good,"My normal day at work was to make sure the entire customer service department did there individual jobs, and make sure customers were accommodated."
good,"Publix has good benefits but as a part time worker they can be limited in comparison to a full time worker."
good,The managers are not interested in the advancement of their employees. Very hard to move up to full-time from part time. Not able to stay working here making 9 bucks an hour part time.
good,"I cant say this for all publix's but the one I was at the over night management was terrible. we would have 4 guys attempted to throw the truck, stock the truck then block It and it could be a 30 pallete truck and we have to get it done in 6 hours ."
good,"Bagged groceries"
good,"My typical day at work involves meeting and greeting customers on a daily basis before, during and after I have completed their shopping experience. I help customers find items in the store, answer questions they may have. If I am unable to assist them I help them find an associate who can for example management. If a customer comes to me upset about something or another department in the store, I will call management to my register to assist the customer. There are so many things to learn in regards to grocery, you seem to learn something new everyday. Management and co-workers are pretty easy to get along with.Hardest part of the job is not being able to speak other languages such as spanish, jamaican, creole or even sign language. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know customers and co-workers."
good,Worked hand in hand with customers on a day to day basis. Provided up-most care for the customer.
good,"Serving customers food cooking making sough my staff do there job's on time  clean and more cleaning     "
good,"Publix is a great place to work. (If you are single) Publix is not a good place to work for married individuals. They make it very difficult to plan family events,vacations, and doctor's appointments. The management team their is very poor and they need serious help hiring good new managers. The benefits plans are good and the pay is pretty good too. Publix does make it fairly easy to live a comfortable life."
good,Advancement has nothing to do with merit; it is based entirely on how much management likes you.  If you go into management you are expected to work 50-60 hours/week.
good,management is nice here unless you are late to work. the only problem i had was i called 2 times and a manger did not answer and i got a pink slip. hardest part is trying to help customers and still do your job.
good,"Worked from 6-3pm any day 5 days a week. cutting, setting-up the cases, check each product out of date, customer service. Very good work relationship with manager helping counting/inventory. The hardest par of my job is just a schedule change. The most enjoyable part of my job is the good team work and my customers satisfaction about my job, my advises etc......."
good,Fast paced work environment with many opportunities for advancement.
good,my experiance in the publix return center warehouse was very good while it lasted
good,"Bag grocery, and I lean how to give great customer service. Management is okay, co workers were nice, and there was not any thing hard to do here."
good,"Busy days - customer service - team work"
good,"Assist kids in everyday life situations, assist kids with indoor/ outdoor activities"
good,It is fun working in a pharmacy. Sometimes the rules new policies placed by upper management are unrealistic and certainly not productive.
good,"Publix consistently pays less than competitors. Staffing is always inadequate for volume. Management is deaf to needs and concerns. Push is for always to do more with less. It's all about the ""metrics"" or numbers with threats to fire you if you don't ""get it done"" despite poor staffing. Getting time off is extremely difficult as they don't have floater pharmacist to cover outages. You have to apply for vacation a year in advance. Swapping with partners made difficult. Must work at least one day each week or burn a vacation week EVEN if you can arrange your own coverage. Dumb policy. If you call out sick expect a major battle when you do and they often don't pay the sick days despite being fully entitled to them per policy."
good,"I liked working at Publix, because of the employee's and the customers you meet everyday. I'd go to work clock in and begin cashiering and stay busy throughout my whole shift. Usually if I wasn't on the register I'd be helping my teammates or if it was really slow I'd clean the other registers or do other duties, Management was okay, not the best. I learned a bit of the salesman trade, people skills, how to read people and communcation."
good,"Typical Day: Unloading Trucks, Stocking Product, Ordering product, maintaining inventory counts, forecasting specials, building displays, training other associates."
good,"Really this is just a place that offers job advancement based on putting your time in like the military. Of course if you have degrees and things like this then your advancement will come faster, but not that much faster. Great company to work for with no degrees. Excellent benefits compared to the other grocery chains in the area. If you are management you are treated like gold, if you are a regular employee they don't care about you."
good,"Job always comes before health or  family. They put all their faith in their part time workers, because they don’t pay them as much and they can work them as much as they want. The management is also very wishywashy and makes empty promise to their employees, especially those who are devoted to their jobs."
good,"It’s not like they say it would be , we don’t work as a team , more like against current and no regard for employees feelings or work ethic. A lot of favoritism, for those that go above , once in while and never any encouragement for those who may be behind"
good,"The company has a very high expectations from its employees, it is almost always busy, responsible management, clean environment and difficult to advance"
good,"Publix is a great first job. It teaches you many important skills of being an employee and how to interact with customers. I loved being able to help people in my day to day. Sometimes you're at the mercy of your managers, but i suppose that is any job."
good,"Very organized company, flexible schedule. Pay was o.k. Very comfortable work environment. Management was a little bit closed doors but very nice and polite."
good,Publix pays decent and has great benefits. Other than those two things it sucks. Customers get away with treating the employees like trash. There were a handful of good managers. I was a manager before realizing I would be worked like a dog and stepped down. Work/life balance is not there as you are expected to be available whenever which often resulted in opening right after closing the previous night. Want a weekend day off to spend with yout kids? Might get it once every 4 months. I quit after 8 years of dedicated service. Retail is not for me anymore
good,"The managers were very much focused on ensuring that the guests were taken care of, perhaps even to the detriment of their workers. It was very difficult to move up; even though they offer benefits and stock in Publix after a year working part-time or less, the chances of getting a promotion or moving to full-time only happen when they have an opening. If you work hard, you may someday be able to move up, but the timing will be completely out of your control. As someone looking to get married and moving out on their own, this was something that I could not accept."
good,"manager got a bad AVS score and then took it out on the team and gave people bogus performance reviews"
good,"Flexible hours,  not steady days.To get hours must be available  every day. .Management  is good. Does offer stock and dental services Sometimes work every weekend"
good,"Everyone at publix who worked with was friendly and the best employees that you will work with. HOWEVER, the management is unorganized. There would be 5 baggers and 2 cashiers open. Also, there is no room for advancement, if you come in as cashier or bagger you are more likely to be in that position the rest of your time there. The hours are not good, people will get around 8 hours a week."
good,The location I worked at seemed to run differently than the rest of the company so I was not happy with some of their decisions. Overall the company cares for their employees.
good,"CS training will make you cream of the crop and an easy hire by the competition! Team work culture awesome! Boars Head training can be awesome if your store rates well. "
good,"I learned you never know a company until you work for them and the grass is not always greener from the other side i was shown how to manage time , stock , do prices , how to organize the products but my manager was lazy and non communicating she put me in the seafood department knowing i was allergic to seafood & i had an allergic reaction and almost lost my life and i missed some days and i called in but she never put it in the system and after a few weeks she started dropping my hours because i told the other department managers and then eventually i was let go from the job."
good,"I worked there for 2 years, the only problem I had with it was how the managers would hang out on the wall and gossip whilst there is a line going out the door. As a younger person they talked down to you acting like your a 5 year old."
good,"Store had strong managers who took concern for their employees.  Busy high sales store, so much was expected. On average customers were rich and had a negative opinion on employees, but managers and supervisors balanced customer needs with respecting employees."
good,I clocked in and I speak to everyone all day while restocking shelves and rearranging the back room. My shifts consisted of times a 3 in the afternoon until 11 o clock
good,"Some location are worst than others, the job is great it’s the people who are chosen to run the locations. Some Managers mistreat their employees for no reason or put work out that they suppose to do"
good,"Retail hours are harsh when they fluctuate regularly, especially when the incentive is low. This can create a lack of motivated and skilled workers, in my opinion. Overall though, Publix is one of the better companies in its class."
good,It was cool but the management was terrible at the store 1174 it was the store a manager that was so bad and he never brushed his teeth now I see why they kept him at that store and never moved him
good,"Personally I think a job at Publix is dependent on your coworkers and management. The one I worked at was a bit rough in terms of both but overall not terrible. I did what I could to make it not horrible. I will say I don't recommend it in terms of a career. They do have stock options and what not but I personally didn't find it worth when getting to the point to where it is worth takes too long and by that time you would have had to go through years of being under paid. Also, this is another personal thing but, the amount of older people that come to Publix is insane. And it is hard to deal with them sometimes."
good,Some weeks I get 10 hours and then some weeks I get about 33 hours and the hours are not stable at all. Also my managers seem bothered when I ask them for more.
good,If you’re going to work a low pay 9-5 job it might as well be publix. They treat the workers relatively okay and the culture of the company isn’t terrible.
good,"I’ve worked at Publix for 12 plus years moved on to team leader , I have a 4 year daughter and the hours are difficult to work with when your manager doesn’t care about you."
good,"Management seem choose who will get more hours, and i always ending with less than 10 hours a week and i know some people steady get 18 to 22 hours a week. Sadly i can say i really like to work here but seem the management not fair enough, some people get a lot hours some like me sometimes i get variation between 3 to 6 hours a week."
good,"Managers constantly contradicts themselves. If you call out for  being sick managers take it out on you when your next schedule comes out, If the managers have friends there they show favoritism. They lie to you about full time offers"
good,I worked EVERYWHERE in that store even though my job title was front service clerk. I eventually worked more in the Deli and Bakery department training and guiding new employees as well as helping with manger duties. I fought for almost two years to get paid Deli salary but the refused and that was messed up
good,You get hurt and they move you to the unsafest department there is. I was then moved to another department.. getting 10 or 11 hours a week. I went from getting 35-40 to 11 hours per week!
good,"Not much advancement"
good,Honestly I like the people just not the management I feel like the company could do better if they treat everyone the same at times I feel like I'm back in high school the way these managers be talkin to me
good,"Loved my co workers and supervisor and manager but was not getting paid what I should for working customer service, I was still getting paid as a cashier after working for customer service for 2 years and I wasn't the only one, so I left. I didn't like being used and because of that they lost a lot of customer service workers back to back. Their stingy on offering full time too."
good,I started out in aprons preparing sample food 5days week 28 hours I made 40+ when they needed help closing in deli when people called out. They talked me put of my spot in aprons.promise me fulltime.gave $ 1.00 raise to transfer in deli. Once I went to deli they didn't give me fulltime .i started getting 15hrs 11 .then 10hrs for 1 week.i couldnt take it I left in Jan 2019.
good,"I think that publix was a great first job however, I think that it is harder than people think to advance and make a career out of it.  It is a great first job."
good,I only work for them because I can relocate and get paid weekly. Also I’ll always have a job. But depending on what you get paid you’ll still need a second job. Hopefully your work environment is good because if the mangers suck it’ll be a hard Publix life
good,Its a retail job more than a healthcare job.  It may seem that the publix rules a be out of date with their hair policy for instance men must be clean shaven.  Thats very old school.
good,I decided to work at Publix as I needed a change from my past job history.  I was able to work on my peace of mind while working in a fast-paced environment.  I enjoy serving both customers and my teammates.
good,It’s a good paying just I feel like I could be doing better & making more then what I’m making now. I’m ready to make over $11 and hit more then 20 hours a week.
good,"Working here is okay if you are young and plan to stay with then your entire career.  I would not recommend working for them if you are older.  The pay is low and if you don't play the politics, you won't get ahead."
good,helping customers was nice and easy. Occasionally became a janitor. most workers were nice. store was very nice and organized. managers were very biased.
good,"Kick off meeting in the morning about work load."
good,"Disclaimer: I worked in the most profitable store in the area."
good,"It’s a good place to work at! It’s a good place to grow. You can start from the bottom i.e bagger and work your way to the top i.e manager, it’s a fun place to grow"
good,"Working full-time at Publix can be stressful. You hardly ever get 2 days off in a row together. Publix has changed so much over the 7 years that I have been there. They took away associates bonuses (only management gets bonuses now), they try to schedule as little associates as possible which in turn is cutting corners that really shouldn’t be cut, and there’s strict dress code. Publix increased the starting wages but did not give an increase in pay to the associates whom have been with the company for several years. So now, people just starting at Publix make almost as much as I do. Promotions barely happen. There’s just no movement. It’s not worth staying anymore."
good,"Publix Supermarkets Inc is a national icon here in Florida. When people come to Florida they are told of the high quality products, unbeatable subs, it's business culture and premier customer service. They claim to be a great place to work and when you first step into the doors you believe it. They bewitch you with this lovely fairy tale of how you will never be disrespected or demeaned by management. You will be treated with dignity. Advancement is fair, timely and a tangible goal. That they care about you. The truth of the matter is that the fairy tale is just that, a fairy tale, fantasy."
good,"The job is a very fast paced environment that is surrounded by oozing testosterone. Work varies day to day and each manager has their own way of what the store should look like when closing. Other co-workers can be difficult as some are not as fast, or take their time which leads to you staying at work for longer than you are scheduled. Grocery management is fantastic, but I do not enjoy my time there."
good,We had to have great customer service skills. We had to work as a team to ensure our jobs were being done correctly as well as efficiently. We would always have to ensure the customers were happy.
good,"Depending on your position or unless you're working at the corporate or you're in management, you don't get paid fairly for what Publix ask for in my opinion. They have many rules that infringe upon getting things done, but still have short deadlines. This job requires a 100% team effort and much dependency on everyone you work with. This can include co-workers that are not in your department. Customers are 150% more important than you to the upper echelon. Weather one would love or hate this job would more than likely be depending on your team and store location. Just don't expect a great team when many people are getting under paid, but expected to do superb services that are worth almost twice as much in other fields and are more appreciated."
good,Publix was a OK place to work but the managers were stressful and not willing to lay off for anything. everything had to be perfect or it was you butt..
good,"Difficult to get full time, which is when benefits kick in. Fine for part timer that likes working for a grocery chain. Encountered "" Here for life"" or "" I don't care"" employees - no in between. The don't care people constantly called out - last minute - and were not ever in fear of losing their job, because no management corrected the behavior. If you have a long shift, you clock out for lunch. If you were planning on buying lunch in store (like at the deli), you generally spend 15 minutes there and another 5 minutes in line to pay. So you now have a 10 minute lunch. No discounts for buying lunch in store, either..... Everybody pays full price at Publix."
good,"As a former deli clerk at Publix, I can say that the pay here was pretty good... $11.00 an hour isn't too shabby. With the biannual employer reviews that happen, you get a chance to boost your pay by $0.25. Private stock is also pretty nice. However, working here is not for the faint of heart. It's very busy and competitive and hours are VERY inconsistent. I remember a couple of times where I got less than 10 hours a week. In all honesty, (in my opinion) it makes the pay not really as worth it."
good,"Honestly, if you're looking for a good paying job, with a good work/life balance, benefits, and retirement programs (even stock shares as a part-timer), then Publix may be a very good fit for you. If you want to advance into mid and upper management, I strongly suggest you look elsewhere. Publix will tell you it's all about how hard you work, then advance someone who doesn't work as hard as you because they have more time with the company. And for those critics, no, it hasn't happened to me, I've just seen it happen to others several times now."
good,"Pay is very irregular,12 hours  a week during off season, then"
good,"It's an okay place to work. There isn't much to tell not advancement for me, no place to go but one sidesways move. The management is negative and they never have a nice thing to say."
good,"worked as a grocery clerk, got around 25 hours per week, a scan price clerk left and they needed a replacement. I took over her position which was a full time position. After 3 months of me being in that position they brought someone else in with no experience from a different store who was already full time. did not want to offer me full time even though i was thoroughly trained. Ended up having to train my replacement and didnt even know I was getting replaced until the person showed up on her first day. Still continued to work at Publix but my hours got cut back down to part time."
good,Publix is a great place to advance if you are willing to move states if not it is hard to get promoted. The pay is decent but I do not know how people make a living if they are not management. Many people in Publix have two jobs.
good,"LAid back, but low pay and hours that are irregular not only in schedule but in amount as well. Wage is steady but unless you work upline they are unliveable."
good,"For a while, it was great! Coworkers are usually a blast to get to know, and management really treats you well personally. But at Publix, management changes all the time, meaning rules and policies tend to become more relaxed or strict depending on the new management and you have to relearn it all."
good,"Started off with a solid 30 hour schedule and got more as I continued on. Some days were rough, but the job got done and felt rewarding. Many people recognized my hard work, and it felt nice, and I learned a lot about being a professional worker. However, my direct manager almost never recognized my hard work and always put me down and made me feel like I needed to get better. He pushed me a lot, and I eventually put a stop to it by quitting. I also developed a skin infection on my neck from the constant irritation from clean shaving every day so that was also a red flag. I would recommend as long as you're willing to shave (they allow beards now) and are willing to put in the work."
good,Company as a whole wasn't bad.  The promotion from within was big to a lot of employees.  Compensation wasn't great but they made up for it in stock options
good,"I'm not saying that Publix is particularly a bad company to work for. For all I know it is the dream job of various people. But the management at the Publix I worked for was subpar to say the least, and I wasn't the only one to have that issue. I wasn't even one of the first 20 people to have a problem with managements lack of professionalism. Could something have been done? Possibly, if everyone didn't cover for anyone else when something was clearly done incorrectly. Or if people were spoken to in a decent manner."
good,"Its always busy at the deli, customers are pretty nice. I worked  with the fryers and rotisserie ovens, sometimes that's the hard part of the job.  Management is pretty fair."
good,"Many people will tell you that Publix is a great place to work no matter who you are, I would disagree. Publix is a great place to work if you are starting out, OR if you wish to work there for 15+ years. Daily work for customer service is no doubt comparable to other supermarkets, but with additional importance placed on the customer, at the expense of the employee."
good,"Your work schedule changes ""every week""... You may have 3 days off in a row but you will work 7-10 days in a row afterwords so forget haveing a life... And ""Week End off"" FORGET ABOUTIT......"
good,Always understaffed so people usually work longer than intended. Lots of customer interaction. Lots of cleaning. Many responsibilities for those who are able to handle it.
good,You have some good managers and you have some bad managers you got some co-workers talk bad about you some talk good about you I like all my customers that I deal with
good,"Used to be a really great place to work. But they started taking away associate bonuses and expecting more work in less time with less people. Used to be a “family” company. Now, if you’re lucky, your immediate manager cares about you or you family but further up the chain they want you to kill yourself working for them. Raises take much longer to go through now. Now it’s just a job that the plus side is the people who work in your department are cool."
good,This job is better if you are single and don't have family hours are long pay is good.pretty much your life belongs to them.Good benefits and chance to move up in the company
good,"I was 51 when I started out in Customer service. I work hard and after 3 months they were impressed with my work ethic enough to move me to another dept. But after 5-1/2 years of part time, meager annual raises and being declined, passed up or ignored for full time even when I showed interest in Mgt. It became clear to me the Manager had no intention of giving me full time, especially when my spouse lost their job. This after I received good reviews each and every time."
good,A good first job for a high schooler but that is about it. It is a very stressful job from working under a bad manager to the mean customers. Taught me how to work hard
good,"Just didn't like hours ,too much politics good stock prgram,bennifitsable to climb the ladder,for mtg perks are good,would recommend for the younger to stay"
good,"I worked with a lot of very nice people, bagged groceries, helped customers load groceries into their cars, and preformed a few simple cleaning and upkeep tasks. The customers were often nice when I made a friendly first impression. I don't enjoy going outside to retrieve carts in extremely hot temperatures, especially for 30 minute intervals. Breaks are often short as are my typical shifts, I only work about 3-7 hours, and only a few days a week. I wanted a part-time job but not only am I only making $9 per hour but I barely work 20 hours a week. Seems like a lot of associates also report having less hours than preferred even after asking for more. It's a nice place to work with friendly people, and a clean and well stocked store, but they need to stop hiring so many extra people when the hours are already so few."
good,"Hours were very unpredictable. One week would be 32 hours, the next week would be 20 hours. They would have me work until 11:00 pm and be back in at 7:00 am. I was told they would work me into full time which never happened. They were hiring other people for part time. It's obvious they do not want full timers in the store. I was on call if anyone called in."
good,"As much as I enjoy working for Publix Supermarkets, the Customer Service staff can be very caddy. The managers are all as helpful as they can be given the company's constraints. The policies in place are meant to weed out the ""bad employees,"" but Publix also has a no-firing policy that lets those employees get by with little-to-no repercussions. These ""bad employees"" can also occupy full-time positions while the more deserving employees are left unable to pay rent in part-time positions. The company needs to be shaken up from the corporate level down. Other than that, it is a lovely, clean, kind environment to work in and definitely my favorite job that I've held."
good,"After ten years of experience, I can say that the job can often be very stressful and many hard working employees often go unappreciated.  Nearly all managers lack college degrees, are very unprofessional, and put their bonuses ahead of employee morale and recognition.  Employee benefits are good but they continue to chip them away year by year."
good,"very busy fast paced environment, must complete a production list every day. Decorate cake orders to meet customers needs."
good,"Been working here for a year. I work my butt off in the deli and know every aspect of it. Full time is a joke unless the store manager loves you. Hard work and knowing how to do your job correctly does not matter. You could be a chimp with supreme customer service skills and get a full time position. If you come in when asked, never call out, stay late to help out, work fast, follow protocol it doesn't matter unless you win the store manager over with charm and butt kissing, you will not get full time. They will raise the pay scale per hour and a new associate that started 2 days ago will make as much as you do per hour after the raises you've received, they do not adjust that, very unfair. Part timers take on the load of hard work while full timers sit back, relax and act like they are so much better than you."
good,"They hire too many people at once, leaving employees currently there not enough hours to make ends meet. Do not work around school schedules- get out of class at 2:45, expected to be there by 2:30."
good,"I worked as a cashier and liked it, The people were friendly and the co workers were great. Hardest part was the hours some morning and then some nights. you close and open the next day"
good,Fun job alright job until something happens to u then they don't care other then that I enjoyed working there its great job experience  learning u alit of new things to learn
good,"I enjoy my store, but I'm looking for my career field advancement. The customers can make the day go by much fast when you help them and get to know them, my co works are also very helpful and can make the day easier."
good,Great benefits and stock options however I was displeased by the amount of time needed in order to advance at all in the company. Management can be helpful as well.
good,While the company has been good to me several changes in recent years hasn't made it the same it was before. If you are looking to make a career out of this company then its a great place to work.
good,the only problem i had was the store i was at their is few full time employees and they were all the employees that had been their for 10+ years i spent 2years here trying to get full time and move my career up with the company but i was not able to do so because they just didn't really have the labor or ability to give me what i really wanted.
good,"Very busy, low pay for part time with few benefits, The only way you could have the benefits was by working basically full time with the classification of part time."
good,Job duties need to be met everyday. Its never slow in the grocery department. Benefits were great and the stock option are great as well. Difficult work environment but if your driven it's not too bad. Lots of temporary workers.
good,its a great place to work at and the team is great at helping each other. great things are said about publix by guest and if you work there you know why the customer service provided is awesome.
good,"This is not the place you want for a career.  It's retail, after all, so don't fool yourself.  Consider this company if you're in school or need to supplement your current income.  So if you're not a student or retiree, move along to greener pastures outside of a retail environment.  "
good,"My time working here was not horrible, however it was extremely stressful; especially working as a cashier. Management was very good though, most of my managers provided a more comfortable working environment."
good,"It’s was a nice place just certain people in management we’re snobby, rude, disrespectful, and would talk about you behind your back. We do maintain good customer service as employees."
good,"I can speak only on the deli section.  The job is what is expected in an almost entirely customer service driven job.  If the customer comes up with anything they want, they get it, if you are ok with this then you will do very well."
good,Competitor pay. Management sometime doesn’t care about your personal matter at times. The work schedules were off than requested when I applied for the job. But other than that it was an ok place to work
good,"Work load is really hectic and there is no sympathy from management, however customer service is a number one priority always. There are different ways of moving up."
good,The pay is not competitive with the industry average.  The tech help has been severely decreased and is not sufficient to work well in a service focused company.
good,at times it is very stressful. i learned a lot about working in a bakery. upper management at times were great and other times were not very understanding. i enjoyed creating special order cakes for customers.
good,They are flexible with your schedule. however do not offer competitive pay and lack of interest for advancement. Work place culture is ok and managers are ok.
good,Publix prides itself on excellent customer service. Customer satisfaction is of the utmost importance. Teamwork and dedication are a few secrets to the success of this company.
good,"Starting off, things were going left. Management is the ABSOLUTE worst! If you have kids, don't work here because they could careless. A typical day is very busy & extremely stressful. With all the years of great Customer Service I've heard of before working here, it's not  what it seems. Women are expected to work like Men, but don't get paid like one. The hardest part of the job is management & those sometimes nasty customers."
good,"I enjoyed my time at publix, the people were nice and everyone was friendly, but it seemed there was no oppurtunity for myself to move foward. Ultimately, I had to leave to pursue better career oppurtunities."
good,I been working for publix for 10 years it was a good place to work but now it a business they don't wont give you full time eny more. When i first. Work for publix manger work kind and friendly and will work with you if you have a problem but now its just a business
good,"Easy going, but extremely stressful at times. There’s never enough help to get all your daily tasks completed in a timely manner. It is very easy to move up in the company though."
good,"Working in customer service is very slow paced, and for three years i have been requesting to switch departments but none of my managers seem to care enough to help with their part."
good,"Depending on the department you work in, you will be dealing with customers all day. For customer service you have your highs and your lows. Be expected to stay longer than your shift is scheduled for. Make sure you put in time off request way in advance."
good,the coworkers are friendly and very helpful but the management does not seem to do much  until needed but they are knowledgeable and helpful and getting  full time or even moving very quick and most employees have to work five to six years to get to assistant management. This is also just from the one store i have worked at. But I have heard other store locations are better to work for then others. It all depends on the store and location and your preferences.
good,This company only promotes from within.  Which is great if you want to move up.  There are many opportunities for cross training.  To be full time you must have open availability.  So your day could start at 6a or you could be done at 12a.  But if you are willing to put in the hours they are willing to train and promote  you.
good,When opening I helped prepare the sub kits that were projected for the day. I helped prepare and make salads and other dishes that the deli department has for customers. I cut the cheeses and meats for the customers while using suggestive selling. I also cooked chicken and other fried foods to place on the sales floor as well as personally give to customers.
good,"Typical day at work consisted of unloading the produce truck, stock shelves with product, prepared hot foods along with various fruit and vegetable entrees. Learned to work fast in a timely manner. Job culture was predicated on very friendly customer service and going the extra mile for the customer. Hardest part was dealing with impatient customers during lunch and rush hours. It was always a joy working with and meeting new people."
good,I got to pick my hours while I was running track and doing other things they gave me the time I needed off and have some good/ ok benefits for people that are full time
good,It's a good job for security purposes and benefits but other than that its not great. You're expected to work at a higher pace than you get paid for. Seems personal from an outside perspective but management doesn't care that much.
good,"A good place to work, if you're customer oriented. I love being attentive to customers, because I want to see them smile, as well as the enthusiasm that the customer see on my face."
good,"aside from Christmas and New Years, I've been getting one day of scheduled work per week for months now. Every time I ask the management for more hours, they say that they'll get back to me about it, and I never hear about it until I ask them again."
good,I liked it there there when I was a teenager but the inconsistency of hours got old and I needed a better income. I had the opotunity at full time but I wasn't into stay and slaving there.
good,There is a lot of available hours that can be worked at Publix and the job pays pretty well for a grocery job. The negatives are that overtime is not specified as mandatory but you find out quick that it is and that moving up from part time is really hard.
good,Good place to work. Nice people. Very family oriented. Did not like they did not offer breaks or lunches to the Pharmacists and they do not give short term disability to any of their employees.
good,Publix is a decent job if you see yourself becoming a manager for a grocery chain Publix is a good option. If your full time benefits are amazing for you and your family and if your part time the flexibility helps if you have other obligations.
good,"the holiday bonus is great the you'll get in November. free lunch, its free so you can't complain. most of the management is selfish. advancing comes with favoritism."
good,Working for Publix is great for those who want to advance and for those who are given the opportunity. When I started I was excited and eager and that has died down with many changes in policy and management.
good,I would say that unless you have the personality of a stick or are a robot then this is not the place for you. Publix lacks individuality and is harsh when it comes to those who are tad different.
good,Publix has a high turn over rate. My first manager was so great and truly cared about their employees. But she was moved to a different store and we got a terrible new manager. A manager can make or break a store.
good,Publix pays well in the warehouse but they will also work you to death. Unless you want to be a truck drives or you know someone there not really room to advance.
good,Publix is a great company to work for. Have a lot of good days it's just that it's very demanding at my facility. Fasted pace environment not a lot of weekends off. Hard to spend time with family.
good,Managers are salaried so over time is not a requirement.  They provide very good benefits and are a stable company. The associates make the shopping experiences of customers exceptional.  There are many products exclusive to Publix.
good,i would not consider to build a career at piblix. There is no room for my skills in criminal justice. I have to look outside the box  for my future career.
good,"Publix was a fine place to work for your first job, however you must be able to do manual work such as pushing carts in the hot sun all day and stocking shelves."
good,Good job bad management it was a good experience but the opportunity to move up was not present and they were very poor at managing associates and conveying messages to associates.
good,For your role as a Deli Clerk will be assigned to a specific station which you must man your whole shift. You must keep your workplace clean and maintained a day provide great customer service in a professional and timely manner.
good,Started working at publix 4 years ago enjoyed my job a lot then when new management arrived all went down hill. The other day I was written up for helping a customer the thing that we supposed to do at publix so I'm looking for a new job.
good,"Great place to work. "
good,For Part time this is not a good place to stay. In order to move up you have to kiss up way too much. it's not very beneficial accept teaching proper customer service skills.
good,for any young kids looking for a part time or first job publix is great. . in my conclusion that is all i have to say about publix they are just ok i guess
good,"pretty nice job, every one is really nice and helpful. They are kind and train you and even when you need extra help they are there for you. super firendly"
good,Management doesn't care about you or your personal life if things happen in your personal life and you try to get time to work them out or they even slightly effect your job performance they will hold it against you. They expect you to put your job first even before your own children.
good,"Matain and organize aisles, stock items on shelfs and items on sale."
good,"Typical day would consist of, bagging groceries, cashiering, taking out and returning carts, and helping customers with any questions or concerns. Fast paced, you have to always be ready to help or learn."
good,"Extremely long hours for what you had to do. Only department to offer 30 minutes lunch as opposed to 1 hour lunch. Management would play favorites rather than move up legitimately competent workers (e.g. woman working there 1 year was better at job [worked more hours, got dumped all the difficult jobs] than man working there 5; he got the promotion)."
good,Slow/medium work pace. It's normally busy depending on the time of day and holiday. Very strict dress code as well as attendance police. 6 month raise period goes up depending on performance.
good,"Working at Publix was challenging.  I was able to advance starting out in the meat department for almost 2 years and then transfer into the grocery department to open up new opportunities to advance in the company.  The people were pleasant to work with and the managers would give me new challenges consistently.  I learned almost all there was to learn.  I did receiving, ordering, inventory, general stocking, making and hanging tags for all the merchandise, working day shift, closing shift, and overnight shifts.  The schedule became so demanding, I wasn't spending any time at home with my family and my son.  No part of that company seemed to be family-oriented and I had to eventually put in my two-weeks notice and pursue more options."
good,"I worked at a Publix in South Florida, and although there were many benefits and options for advancement, the higher management would make advancements far too difficult, and sometimes give the positions to employees that were far less qualified."
good,"Busy work if you get to work that is."
good,Management made employees feel uncomfortable. They did not communicate well with staff as well as not scheduling according to availability. The culture at Publix is fair. It is not a place that makes you feel comfortable with being you.
good,"Publix is a good company. They have great food in their different departments and good customers. Overall it was nice working there, aside from the few catty employees you run in to no matter where you go."
good,Work life balance is no good. Managers no longer care about associates. Advancement is only available if you're willing to relocate. Managers are not given proper help and are stuck carrying whole department.
good,"You quickly learn the customers are spoiled brats and management has no spine. You're expected to give one thousand percent of your life to them only to receive a twenty five cent raise every six months. Very rare to find a store with a family environment amongst coworkers. They claim to be flexible with your schedule yet do the opposite. Favoritism plays a huge part in day to day operations. Clock in, do your job, clock out."
good,"At my particular store, the management was not very concerned about the well being of their employers. It's been almost two years since I worked there so it has probably improved but my 3xperience at Publix was not very enjoyable after the first few months."
good,"its not a bad place to work, just depends on your managers really. i was there five years and could never get full time or transfer. the pay is good for any single person"
good,"I enjoyed my work, only issues where when management became petty. I liked getting paid every week, I enjoyed working with my team and assistant manager."
good,The typical day at work each day during the days i would be scheduled  would be repetitive and very tedious . The one thing that i have learned during my time at publix is to train people to do a new task . I really have enjoyed making a new employee feel welcome to a hard working team and helping them become feel part of that such team .
good,"publix is a very serious job , you dont really have time to play around its a good job and i believe it teaches you good work ethic and manners , are managers are nice but strict at time when things are not going right . the hardest part about working at publix is maintaining a positive attitude when you have rude customers"
good,Secure and opportunistic. Publix is very flexible with hours and appreciate your extra effort. As long as you show that you care and you are efficient the job is great and they are like family.
good,"Publix is a great place to work for, if you are in it for the benefits. Management can be difficult sometimes to work with, but in the end it is worth it."
good,"Honestly, I enjoyed Publix for the most part. I liked the people I work with, or at least the majority; most of the management was decent. My particular location had frequent management changes though."
good,Pretty much just a job. Pay isn't terrible. Plenty of advancement opportunities . Bad work/life balance. Expected to work anytime if you're full time.
good,It's a job that does give you some sense of security. The environment is friendly but the work environment leave some to desire. It is however different from person to person.
good,"One of the better places to work if you want to be an owner in the company. High expectations. For the most part there is quality management. As a part time employee hours are unpredictable from week to week but has good opportunities for promotions. Like anywhere, having a good attitude is key. Respect is expected for employers and employees alike. Open door policy."
good,"Have a lot of responsibilites"
good,"The company overall is a good stable company. The bakery division requires more efficient and consistent work policies. "
good,Is a company with very good benefits. Need to be available to work any time. Like they said you are the first one to come and the last one to leave.
good,"Publix was an enjoyable experience for me because of the culture and the people. I've made lifelong friendships with my peers at this job. The only issue is that management runs the world. Advancement is run by management, and managers at Publix tend to play the favorites game. Its frustrating."
good,"Publix is not a hard place to work at but it is labor intensive, often times due to understaffing you will have to pull extra weight. The manager of my store was not very friendly and put policy ahead of employees to a disturbing degree.This coupled with a very poor starting salary makes it especially hard for people like me who were looking to make ends meet."
good,"typical day at work would be stocking shelves with products, loading and unloading the service trucks, filling water on shelves, organizing isles an back room, and bailing cardboard. always helping customers as much as possible. Management is okay, co-workers are like a family close knit people. hardest part about my job is the heavy lifting, the most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers."
good,A typical day was taking care of patients by filling prescriptions. The culture of the company is phenomenal unfortunately during slow times jobs can be cut.
good,"You must constantly be doing something. If there are no customers then you will clean or put away returns."
good,"A day at work is enjoyable when customers are nice and the manager is nice. How to manage a customer, handle them, give great customer service and have knowledge of what is going on in the store. My coworkers are enthusiastic with their job and very pleasant. When customers are in a bad mood."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company, not the department. Everyone was whiny and complaining.  No one was happy and no one was content. A typical day went like this post edit until Produce came down then post edit some more.  When produce AM comes down attach backhauls and review it.  Then post edit some more. I learned never to mispunch. The hardest part of the job is to be there. The most enjoyable part of the job is to go on vacation."
good,A typical day at work includes processing customers orders. I have to handle cash check money orders and wic vouchers. The company is a decent company to work for. They offer great flexibility and great weekly pay. the hours vary and the shift lengths fluctuate
good,"A typical work day is stocking new items when shipment arrives. "
good,I've worked with Publix for over 5+ years. The company has a lot of the necessary foundations to provide associates with the work environment that they showcase through internal and external advertising. Where working is a pleasure is their motto but there seems to be a disconnect with management not providing the necessary support and education to have job security and advancements. I believe Publix overtime will correct this flaw as they embrace the current trends in today's marketplace.
good,"Company with benefits for full time and part time associates. Special holidays off such as Christmas and Thanksgiving, which allows time at home with the family,"
good,"It was a good place to work but you could only get benefits after being there a year, even then, they were hard to get. But the employees and friends I made there were nice and made it a good place to work regardless"
good,"The company expects more work than what they compensate for, ie paying employees $8 per hour and expecting $12 per hour worth of work."
good,"this was my first real job. i learned everything there is to know about warehousing work. management allowed me the chance to learn all aspects of each job. shipping,receiving, and clerical work"
good,"The environment is not particularly stressful and the tasks are menial at their most difficult. Handy for students working their way through school but if said student is unwilling to shift to full time work there then, best case scenario, anything higher than the current job class is difficult to achieve."
good,The benefits are great IF you can make it the 90 days and 1 Year to qualify. 90 days for vision/dental and 1 year for stock/bonuses/healthcare. The scheduled shifts typically go for several hours longer than scheduled and tends to cause tension between managers and associates. This could easily be solved by scheduling the correct number of associates needed to complete tasks by appointed times.
good,"Fun work place"
good,Fun if your in high school or college maybe difficult to support a family off of if starting from the bottom. If you don't want to stand in one spot for 8 hour you like because Publix is huge.
good,Working for Publix is a great. If you are willing to do anything for the customer. Publix strongly believes in the customer always being right.
good,i rather much more enjoyed the time in the back room in comparison to the time spent in the deli it was a far more peaceful environment
good,Hard to move up unless you have been there a long time. Overall good environment though and supportive managers. Free lunch every day which is a nice perk.
good,"The job is a high stress environment that can easy break you. Everyday is a different pace but the associates are great people to work with and be around, they make they can make the job easier and less stressful or they can also make it one of the worst possible. The managers try to cooperate with you and make the job better but sometimes they can't see the errors that are right in front of them and need help like any other person. Some situations are handled accurately and others not so much. I have yet to find any reward in this job though, I feel that I am not appreciated/ compensated well enough for the work that I present and give daily to the company."
good,"Publix is an alright place to work. The most enjoyable part about working there was assisting the customers and brightening up their day. The hardest part about working their was that some, not all: associates, managers, and customers, were hard to deal with."
good,"Great corporate structure, but they have some issues placing people where they need them.  I was in a specialty department and there were issues keeping people in them.  They know how to over work you when people are out for long periods of time.  They could not replace anyone so you were slammed with more hours than you could handle.  I was taking an online class and failed it because they kept putting 48-50 hours a week on me.  The money was great, but I failed my online class.  No fun when you have to pay for your own classes.  "
good,"For a grocery store expectations are high. Some great management out there, but most fall below the line of acceptable. Publix is family oriented with sounds great but is not. Mostly family advances into management and very few others make it through. Advancement is based upon like-ability."
good,"Publix is a great company, but has some defects. Publix is trying really hard to compete with CVS and Walgreens Pharmacies and are actually turning into them. Publix is suppose to be all about customer service and interacting with the customers. There is no time for that. Right now, for Publix, it's all about the numbers and how many prescriptions the pharmacy can fill with as little manpower as possible. That makes it very difficult not to make a mistake."
good,Publix is a descent place to work for but iI have noticed new managers being promoted that were a little to green under the collar and not quite ready for what they could really bring to the table.  And some of the new management I have noticed need to look back and really remember they were once that employee that they are badgering about on work performance.
good,"The older employees would often tell stories about the good old days of working for Publix, when employees were viewed more as family rather than as resources. When payraises came frequently and were substantial. When it seemed like management really cared about who they were working with."
good,"I found this job very tiring. This was my first job and it happened to be after I was in the hospital for two months, so I had many disability issues. I feel that my review would not be fair to report."
good,"Serve customers; bag groceries and take to cars; retrieve carts from parking lot; some cleaning"
good,Management is severely lacking. The Publix Culture is great on paper but does not exist in actual manager's in most cases. Cannot rely on manager's to support you. Bad associates stay and rarely get counseled. Good associates are punished.
good,"Some days were better than others. Its better to know someone in a ranking position. Publix over all is an ok company, and very well with  benefits."
good,"Benefits or very expensive for hourly employees.  Time off is good, but very difficult to get full-time.  Management staff has no work life balance."
good,Started bakery at 4 am.....made all breads from scratch. maintained the floor stocked with fresh product dailey . odering scheduling
good,"They feed you this line on how great the company is and how you can retire as a millionaire from the company but it is all a pipe dream. You have to become a manager and work 50 hours a week every single weekend and holiday with the hope that just maybe you will retire after 40 years as a millionaire. They use this as an excuse to give poor or no raises. I have mixed emotions about this place, the management generally sucks but co workers are pleasant. If you have no other choice then I'd say go for it, otherwise you can do better."
good,Helped me improve on my customer service and perfect my skills. co workers made the environment fun.hardest part of job was working late and most enjoyable part of job was operating cash register and interacting with customers
good,"its a production past job so you have to learn how to make money in pressured manor,the best part of the job is driving fast fork lifts, you learn how to drive all types of fork lifts."
good,it was pretty busy because I kind of floated so I never really had an set station or area to work. but it benefited me because I became knoledgeful in all areas of the facility
good,"Stock shelves and answer questions. Pay sucks and if you're not full time, no benefits. People who work in your department help, outside of that you're on your own"
good,"The Deli is nuts, but the best place to get advancement. Don't work there if you're looking for nothing more than a job to have while in school/college."
good,"The benefits are amazing if you can manage to get promoted. I've been told that I am up for promotion for 6 months and still have not been promoted. When I ask what I should do to improve they tell me ""just keep doing what you're doing."""
good,"Publix enables its employees to own stocks within the company. Management provides opportunities for growth, by training employees within their current positions for greater responsibility in affording them potential promotions."
good,I would begin my day by reviewing our total workload (Shipping & Receiving) after this I would  take attendance and begin assigning our 70 to 80 associates with their job assignments and/or duties  for that day. I learned that production cannot compromise quality. Management was nice but not very helpful or knowledgable when asked questions. My co-workers were hard working and dedicated men and women who worked as a team and  took great pride in their work. The hardest part of the job were the long days that could last  12 to 15 hours depending on the workload. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and working with others.
good,"Publix is a great company to work for, but my particular store did not want to be flexible with my availability. I worked every weekend from 2pm-1am and I never had a chance to really attend my church obligations. I understand that I was a new employee and I had to put my time in with the company, but I feel like managers were very prejudiced against me. Out of everyone that made mistakes on the job I would be the one singled out. The whole stocking associate department is ran by kids and the management lets them do whatever they want. If the company had more organization and procedures maybe they would operate more efficiently."
good,"working with associates was fun, management was lazy and ridiculous, no care for personal time"
good,"I learned how to treat customers with respect and help them when they are in need. I've learned where items are so I can let customers know where items are. I learned to work as a team and help co workers with problems and helped new employees feel comfortable with their new positions."
good,"Typical day at work involves catering to the needs of whiny customers and impossible to satisfy management, all the while wondering, as a part timer, whether or not you're going to even get consistent hours from week to week. Great for a high schooler, not an adult."
good,"A typical day involved lots of movement, and hard work, which allowed me to learn how to manage my time, and responsibilities. Management loved me, but at times seemed as though they didn't appreciate all the work done by every worker. My co-workers we supportive, and humorous, which helped very much during those difficult times when your exhausted, and were not in the mood to be at work. Never the less the humor provided the much needed motivation to march forward, which made going to work enjoyable once you saw the joy in the customers faces."
good,"I unload trucks, do price changes, put out merchandise, and customer service on a daily bases. I have learn the different cuts of meats and the process, and also the importance of being customer friendly. I love my co-workers because they always practice teamwork, and put the customer's first. The hardest part of being a meat clerk is unloading up to one thousand pounds daily. The best part of my job is seeing my returning customer's happy."
good,I am currently one of the cake decorators and for the most part it is fun. My co-workers are great and love to have fun with me and the customers. Sadly the hardest part of working here is management. It seems like most of them are grumpy and just hate their job and being there. The best part of my job is seeing someones face light up when I hand them a cake that I made for them. makes the stress sometimes worth it.
good,Job schedules are unpredictable and breaks are sporadic.  Not easy to transfer to other job opportunities within the company.  Took Deli position only because cashier position was not open.
good,Being a cashier was the most fun job I've ever had. Having races with my bagger to see who was the fastest.
good,"Publix or at least the Publix I work at is VERY busy. To busy and not enough workers, due to the fact that our new employees last for a few days. Its a very multi tasked job, and can be very entimidating. Our customers expect everything to be ready and prepared for them, and if something isn't ready we sure do hear about it. Its stressful at times. But I have learned from working there 8 years in August."
good,"Publix is a descent company to work for.  They do have great benefits and an employee stock option plan that beats any other pension program available.  However, there are many terms and conditions surrounding this program and the obtaining full time employment status could take anywhere from 2-8 years, depending on if management likes you or not."
good,"Depends on what position you are in, the closer to management the better but if you're not close to management it's just decent."
good,Learned about business. Experienced many phases of retail distribution.
good,I most enjoyed being able to work with others and help our guests.
good,"a typical day at work is stocking shelves, cleaning shelves, assist customers, unload truck, straighten items on shelves. A lot of bending, stoopings, carrying heavy items. Climbing up and down ladders."
good,"I was doing really well until they changed up the management and put in a very selfish and lousy manager. The managers under her were much better at their jobs, and she does not like to follow the rules or support her crew members."
good,The staff in my department is one of the best that I have ever worked with on a daily basis
good,Typical work day consisted of helping our customers have an enjoyable shopping experience
good,I was a hard worker. I was promised a raise and never received one. I enjoyed my co-workers. The hardest part was unloading all the trucks that came in that day by myself.
good,"co-workers could be rude., short breaks.. lack of hours for every week...  if received hours or long shifts, the breaks were inefficient & if scheduled for a break, it was either forgotten or skipped and let someone else go, before you and it wasn't their scheduled time.."
good,Driving forklift moving product from dock to its correct location for selectors to pick from to complete orders for various stores.
good,Good job to work for. Typically good work place. Learned alot . Enjoy co workers
good,"the deli at this publix location is the busiest deli ive ever seen. about half the employees there have amazing work ethics. the manager has no idea how to work hard or get things done quickly. she also doesnt know how to deal wioth the other half of the staff- the half that doesnt have such a good work ethic. the result of all this is that good employees and myself will be interupted either to perform an in-efficient task, or to do someone elses work. she cant tell someone who is slow to work fast, but she can ask someone who is working fast to do more work."
good,"Work was easy, benefits were great, management was terrible. Most of the management were picky about what employees were able to do what work. They showed a lot of favoritism."
good,In the bakery you have a lot of physical work and do a lot of customer service help too. The bakery gets hot in the summer. Like any place you have really great co workers and then there are some that wish they weren't there. The pay is pretty good for retail but it is hard to get full time at some stores. If you aren't full time there is no promise you will get the required hours needed to keep your insurance.
good,"A typical day at work would be arriving at publix, clock in, and go to the floor and see if anyone needs a bagger. If not then outside I would go to see if any of the carts needed to be brought in, normally when that process is done someone is in need of a bagger. If I would be working nights the crew members and I would be stocking shelves or as they call it ""blocking"""
good,"During a typical day I am responsible for multiple tasks. These can range from stocking, recieving inventory, customer orders, preparing orders, preparing food, and customer service. The hardest part of my job is the inability to advance and take on more challenging tasks. The most enjoyable part is the customer interaction and my co-workers. I have learned many valuable skills from the management team. I have learned how to order inventory, inventory control and response to shrink, and positive customer relations."
good,"Publix is a good solid option and for the first few years was a great place to work had full coverage in benefits, but new managers constantly and rules always changing."
good,That tells it all.
good,"I go to a job with the mindset of how can I make someones day brighter. I have learned none of us are goof proof and with any and or all mistakes we make we grow and learn from them. I am a team player with respect towards not only supervisors but also the ones I work closely with everyday. Not always being able to satisfy all people all the time is hard, however when you actually make a difference it makes the road bumps even sweeter."
good,"I should start out by saying I work in the Deli, at a very busy store."
good,I am in need of working full time. Publix is no longer offering full time positions for Pharmacy Technicians.
good,"First thing I noticed is that they pay well. I work as a bakery clerk and for about half my shift I'm a one person department. Closing shift sucks. There's a lot of cleaning. Make sure you speak your mind about your schedule because they will work you like a mule unless you don't say anything. They never ever give people full time employment, so look elsewhere if you need a full time job. There's definitely a lot of favoritism so if you want to get somewhere you have to be a brown noser. Sometimes your coworkers are the only thing to keep you sane!! Befriend older people because sometimes they've worked there for decades and have a lot of useful information."
good,A day of work is practically long and on most cases unfulfilling.
good,"Overall Publix is a good company to work for. Most managers are great and willing to help you more up. Some, Not so much."
good,"Publix has the capacity to be an excellent career. I have learned many aspects of managing others, managing a safe and detailed accounting, and fulfilling an overall mission within a team."
good,"Level product on shelves, unload trucks, separate product and stock shelves. Learned teamwork and organization. Management was well knowledged as they promote from within. Co-workers were easy going and laid back. Hardest part of the job was not being able to obtain full time and finding out it would take years to achieve it. Most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the public."
good,"The typical day at publix was just like every other day could'nt tell one day from the next you can epect the same.I learned how to count money fast and about new food,s.My co-workers were quiet and spoke in pairs and offered help when they seen it was needed.the hardest part of the job was standing for hours.The most enjoyable part was the customers."
good,"My own personal experience is that the bottom line is more important than the actual person. We are consistantly short staffed and have crazy scedule, but it has not always been that way. But overall if you have a great management team then the hardest part of your day is keeping up with the physical labor involved."
good,As a vital part of the customer service staff my responsibiltes included:
good,I like Publix but I feel like I hit a dead end and I want to advance in the company not stay the same always all the time in the same position after being promised to be trained as something else too many times
good,Customer service skills are needed when working with the public. Publix is a great environment when you are working in management and even cashier positions and customer service.
good,"I got my job from an employee that worked there, but eventually he got fired. When my manager got fired and the other one took his place we just didn't get along.Eventually someone in my family passed away and i missed a day of work, also while i let all managers know that someone passed away none would excuse me for the day of work i missed. So when the day came that i was supposed to work again i was sent up front to store manager and was fired for missing X number days of work."
good,"Overall i enjoyed working at Publix. I especially like the fact the I was able to keep a steady pace between transactions, which made the time go by fast."
good,"Great place but only if you want less than 15 hours a week if not it's not worth the drive !!! Pay deff depends on experience!!"
good,"A typical work day at Publix is pretty much the same it all depends on the customers. I learned alot about taking care of customers wants and needs and how to handle money. I also had some experience working within the customer service office at Publix. I would say the hardest part about working at Publix was dealing with customers. Customers are not always in a good mood and can disagree with policies, but I learned how to solve their problems and make sure they are not upset. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people that I got to work with."
good,cant advance in wine department there is no opportunity.  they have more liquor stores then wine stewards.  the company is about to change drastically they are working to exclude their employees from stocks
good,A lot of politics and very clickie benefits amazing management shows a lot of favoritism duties not handed out equally. Evaluations Not rated the same for everyone.
good,"Honestly there is not much to describe except that its not as horrible as others make it out to be. Days are long and depending on the people you work with, it could make it or break it for you. Management can be an annoyance while others are super cool. I think I get paid well enough to stack apples comparably to other jobs I worked at. As long as you keep your head on straight and don't anything to stupid, they won't fire you for it, it's almost impossible to fire someone there. So I think it is good as an entry level job."
good,Publix was a great place for advancing and becoming  manager. Great benefits great 401K lots of things to invest very good company. a great place for moms student retirees or somebody that's just in between jobs it's all kind of jobs that are available for you there they also have job that's posted in other states that you can also apply for there's many opportunities that can arise from that company
good,Publix is a great company with good benefits. They also have possibilities to move up and forward in the company. I enjoyed working for them . The only issue I had was they cut hours and I was only getting 3 days a week. The people were friendly and so was the staff.
good,In the typical day at Publix Super Market customer service is key. You can feel it when you walk through ought the entire day. That's one thing i have plenty experience in is customer service. With this job i have also learn how to deal with different types of people. The most important thing i like about this job is meeting people and just being kind. Its so amazing how you meet different people from different walks of life.
good,I worked extremely hard for the full year I worked at Publix and I left there on good terms I never was talked to or had any problems with my performance while I worked there
good,Publix is a great company to work for. I wish that they did more hiring at the management level. I understand the promote from within and work your way up mentalit.
good,People who I work with show to have favorites and not everyone is friendly. The pay is good for a part time. Management doesn't really see you enough to evaluate you properly
good,"Customer service is tedious. It requires you to pay attention to hundreds of customers a day. Even if they complain, which they will, you still have to serve them"
good,"Publix markets themselves as a pleasure to work for. As a manager, this is accurate. As an associate, particularly part-time, not so much. One must ""trust the system"", ""bleed green"" and ""drink the kool-aid"" and have the right connections to really get anywhere or have a pleasant work-experience. poor management is rampant. Like anywhere, it's all in who you know."
good,Working for a very successful company such as Publix requires a lot of  team work to ensure the work is done. The managers are well equipped to lead their department to success.
good,No room to advance. Decent start pay. The managers chose favorites and sometimes displayed unprofessional behavior. Allotted tasks not part of job description
good,Lots of work to do. Keeps you busy. Advancing in company takes time. Play favorites. Cool part time job. Beginning job for kids in school. Decent pay for a beginner job
good,"It helped me get myself on my feet’s and be a little bit more independent,  good working hours, met nice people and made small talk, learned to be more generous and understanding."
good,Management is really bad. The current store I am at doesnt have hours to give to employees but will not let me transfer to another store. I have had bad experiences with Publix management staff.
good,"There have been some definite changes during my time with this company. We have continue to grow at an almost exponential rate and have been able to maintain the company's core values of customer and hourly associates first. However, if Publix doesn't evolve sooner rather than later, it will be consumed by companies with better / more tangible employee benefits. People are struggling to make ends meet now , and are not so focused kn what you can offer them by way I of retirement  that for the majority of the workforce is in the distant future."
good,"Publix does the bare minimum when it comes to their employees. They say that they care but that all depends on how long you have been with the company. If you have been with the company for a while, you have great benefits and resources. If you have not been there very long, they don't give you an option to better yourself"
good,Hard work and a lot of hours. Great pay and benefits. They do not have a set schedule and are very strict on time and attendance. Don’t be late or miss days
good,"A typical day at work would be assisting customers with their needs, in doing so providing premier customer service. Always having a positive attitude even in frustrating situations and calmly handling the situation to your best ability. Publix provides a safe environment for everyone and is not prejudiced of anyone's race, religion, or background."
good,Heavy work load. Demanding on time and speed. Difficult place to work if you have family members in superior positions. Overall gives employees multiple chances to learn the job.
good,Every job has problems good and bad days. What people do on the job whether it's good or bad is not my concern. Unless it involves me and my job position.
good,It’s an alright job but ur stay there late at night and u have to clean the store and everything u don’t get benefits u sometimes get free meal coupons
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people every day. The hardest part of my job is getting shopping carts altogether constantly. It is very tedious especially when it is so very hot outside. A typical day is greeting your customers packing their groceries and taking them out to their cars. Mgt is pretty nice for the most part but could use some more help in the area. What I have learned at Publix is that they strive to be the number 1 food chain supermarket in the country.
good,The hardest part of the job is often having to switch between bagging and getting carts when you've developed a groove with one of them. The most satisfying part is being able to help the customers that really need it.
good,"everyone tries to work at publix so bady, the company is great for certain reasons but for certain things they lack on, but overall great place! and lovely memebers."
good,Publix is a good place to work especially if you are going to school. The hardest part is that management teams are often changing. The benefits are good though and you can be paid well for doing what is usually a relatively easy job.
good,"Not enough pay for what you do, not enough hours for part time job. Other than it is good work place to work, good coworkers, some managers are ok, some of them is very good managers."
good,"•	Protect the company’s property and staff by maintain a safe and secure environment "
good,"Never understood why they'd just not let a 18 year old guy work. Like really I'm 18 out of high school my family is struggling and I need hours to help my parents and I live."
good,"It's a strong workplace, attend to customers, complete platter orders, production by following forecast, inventory count, steritech and health department walks."
good,Publix taught me a lot of things to help me in life and was one of my favorite jobs it was just time for me to leave. Anyone looking to work there will enjoy their time.
good,good company to work for they give you good benefit options and they are very flexible when it comes down to your schedule and the management is very professional.
good,"Managers did not communicate properly. The deli manager was very flexible with my schedule and did work with me since she know I was going to school too. But, the assistant deli manager was not so much. I was fired and I was not supposed to be working."
good,"Each store is different depending on Area, Management. Customer can break or make your day. It’s up to you on how you want to come across and keep yourself in high standards with Publix Mission."
good,"Publix does a lot to make sure you are taken care of. However, your managers are the antithesis of that, and usually don't communicate well amongst themselves even. You could be asked to work an extra shift by one, just for another to say you shouldn't be working because it's bringing down production/hours."
good,Publix culture in 2012 (at least in my store) is totally different from now. Morale has gone down after the good managers and associates left/quit. New hires starting pay is about the same if not higher than those who worked there for a while. Part time associates don't recieve their bonuses every year anymore. We're overworked and underpaid for the things we do. Good associates are mistreated while bad associates are able to get away with it. Totally draining and puts a toll on you. Not worth the trouble.
good,"This place has great benefits and atmosphere but a bad manager can ruin the whole experience. Very customer oriented. You have to be good with people to advance at all. "
good,"No hours, and no room for growth. They believe in Legendary Customer Service. I agree 100%. They will not fire you which I find very cordial of the company."
good,"Working in the deli is fast paced.  There is always something to do.  There really isn't ever any down time, which makes for what feels like a fast shift."
good,"Publix is a fun place to work, where you can learn something new each and every day. The most enjoyable part of my job is serving the customers, and making their days better."
good,Decent place to work.The people I met were pretty kool. I would recommend Publix. They were pretty good about working with you on your schedule. No bad
good,I felt like I was doing the most work. But it’s ok cuz I’m in my real bag now🤷🏾‍♀️ Um I suggest more communication. With your manager on how u feel.
good,Working for publix is good but it got its good and bad especially working long hours 5 plus days with only 2 or 3 days off but other than that its a good place to be
good,"Good Job for high school kids starting out and good if you just need money when your in college. It was a decent job but the pay could be better, everyone is willing to help you, the managers talk and yell at you like your their children."
good,I enjoyed working at Publix. It's a good in-between job to make some cash before figuring out where you want to work long term. I personally didn't mind the actual stocking portion of the job because it kept the day moving but 7 of the 10 hours worked is mainly spent facing products which makes the day feel like years.
good,"Hired on as part-time. Transferred to another store to get full-time position. After transfer, I was told they could not get me FT, but would get me as close to 40 hours a week as possible. Not to bad because the new store was closer to home. I would on some days open at my store (8:30 am  - 4:30 pm) then fill-in at another store to close (5:00 pm - 9:45 pm). After new Publix  stores were opened, hours were cut to accommodate FT employees to get their hours. I got approximately 12 - 15 hours a week. The busier the store, the more employees needed. Over saturation of Publix stores causes lower volume of customers for each stores. From where I live, there are 4 stores within 5 miles, and 4 other stores within 10 miles. Good company, especially if you're FT. The wonderful pep talk talked you get when starting working for them and it being a great career, stock options and contributions, is good but only for FT employees."
good,I loved my store and most of the co workers I worked with. My only issue and only reason at times I hated being there is because of my managers. They were extremely lazy and spent their entire time in the office just talking amoungs themselves. Even over heard them talking down on one of my co workers but it was not my place to go give that to another ear. Extremely hard to get fulltime. You would basically have to kiss butt. And thats something I dont do.
good,"I was always told to open my availability and I’d get more hours, however it was completely open and they consistently scheduled me 3-7 hours a week. Impossible to make a living off of."
good,"High focus on being the premier customer service and care provider. Besides replenishing grocery products and maintaining inventory of the dry goods, the highest priority is tending to the customer."
good,I loved my job at publix it was great pay and great hours. But then they switched around manager (which they do ofter) and the store turned down hill. Just be sure your store manager isnt fake and you should be good
good,Publix being a local business they want to keep people comming back. Associates are graded in how well you lick the boots of the people who come in to the store. Overall not a pleasant place to work.
good,"As a pharmacist you will be required to manage routine and non-routine issues. Work schedules are rigid. Benefits are good. Overall the company is among the best for retail pharmacy,"
good,"I was under constant scrutiny by in-store management. I never felt wanted or felt my work met there expectations, despite the praise by corporate employees."
good,"If your thinking of applying at publix i personally would reccomend it. IT was a great place to work, good work enviroment, nice co workers, and nice customers."
good,"I appreciated the devotion of the management to the company, however, I feel like the could have been more firm with the employees in regards to attendance. Although they were friendly to work with they had a high tendency to call out or not show up; all without repercussion."
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job was talking and socializing with coworkers. The hardest part of the job was going out to bring in the carts. The workplace culture was good everyone made me feel welcomed. Management was a rollercoaster for me. I learned how to use a register, how to write a check, and how to bag. a typical day at work was clock in and relieve a person leaving then going on register until your break where you clock out get food eat it then clock back in and go back on register until you clock out. they didn't have a separate break room so we shared a room with the managers when they had a meeting and we would have no table to sit at. I also learned that doing what you are suppose to do wont get you anywhere."
good,"very plasant to work at publix, competitive pay,safe space where you can grow if you want to make publix as your career fun lerning friendly coworkes and managements"
good,"They’re a decent place to work, the work environment is generally pleasant. If you’re capable of time management and workplace organization it can be decent."
good,everyone is very serious and everyone has to do their jobs accordingly and sometimes that ask a little too much and some of the managers act kindve biased
good,"A typical day at work was stressful, hot and not fun. I didn't like it there at all. They would make me do everything like a slave or something. Clean bathroom then bag and do carts then call me to do other stuff."
good,"It’s hard to move up if you’re not in the politics.. which is hard to get into. You’re expected to work your tail off for minimal compensation. Some stores let you keep your OT, but most make you cut it at lunch. It’s hard mental work, meaning that you will constantly have to talk yourself down from disrespect from customers, coworkers, and management. It’s a great job if you’re part time and just looking to get a paycheck."
good,Great company to work for and they pay wasn't that bad for the grocery department. Cant complain about hrs since I was part time but I'd you go above and beyond with a customer and they tell your manager you could get a free sub.
good,Publix has a great reputation. I won't negatively rate it just because my experience  was  bad. It is great 1st job and does reward those who stay and invest in stocks.
good,It’s a demanding company with not a lot of advancement based on lack of good management . Management or lack there of dictated daily morale. I would enjoy more consistency
good,"The store I worked at was new and they keep sending managers to ""train"" there so you end up with a lot of people showing and not knowing their job and leaving."
good,"I worked for Publix for half a year and my time there was enjoyable for the first few months. It was my first job and I was excited to work there and I knew about the culture due to going there many times as a customer. The interview process was fairly quick (one week) though I heard many times people wait months to get an interview or at least a response. The area where my Publix was located is in a Hispanic community and the workers there, for the majority spoke Spanish as well (myself included). After a few months, the management that I was hired under changed and the work environment changed as well, making the job less enjoyable. The new management also did not work with my school schedule as much as the old management did and as a result I got less hours which caused my resignation."
good,"Everyday is pretty much the same. A truck would come in before I would get there and then I had to level, throw truck, and then level again. We where never on schedule so the managers would always be stressed."
good,Publix is a great place to work because they give good hours and they had really good benefits and they had respected policies. It is a quick paced I learned so fast to used the machine in the deli. I love !!
good,"They treat employees very poorlyThey treat employees very poorly scanning and organizing patients medical record by date, name and time. This allows quick access for nurses and other staff members to access medical records when a patient is in for medical appointments."
good,Simply I’ve been working with Publix for 2 years and I learned it’s easy to move up if you try. You scratch the manager back they scratch yours. All you need to do is put your head down and work and you can move up quick if that’s what you want to do.
good,I worked at Publix for three years and at first it was great but eventually after moving managers around it became stressful. I wouldn’t recommend a long term career there but great for a start up job.
good,It is a part time job while you continue your schooling or any other certificates you may be enrolled in. They can be flexible around the hours your available to work.
good,"Working here is stressful and fast-paced. If you are not up for that, or cannot handle the stress, I do not recommend applying here. However, you do get coupons every month for doing a great job."
good,It was a good place not much to it it wasn’t hard it was okay and I would recommend someone who is good with costumer service it’s a nice environment and good.
good,Good place to learn and to start a career. Management is very stressful and full of pressure. Very hard to have a family/ work balance. Very good stock and 401k benefit I will say.
good,"Publix is a company that promotes from within. If you show up on time everyday and work hard, you will be compensated. Any in store position is demanding physically. You will be expected to work on your feet. Customer Service is your primary focus."
good,Publix has great opportunities to move up in the company. The customer service is incredible and that’s why people work and shop their. Sometimes it can be stressful and management can be stressed too but that’s apart of the job.
good,"Managers drive you a little crazy. The coworkers make it easier. A little tough to advance, though. If you have to call out sick, they'll really be dismissive about it, and make it harder than it has to be."
good,"Clocked in. Stocked the register. Clean area then proceed to wait on customers."
good,I feel my review is pretty accurate one of the biggest cons I have is when they raised the minimum and the top out last time we the the full timer that had been there a long time should have got an extra raise when the raised the pay scale  three times last year I was in the middle of it so it didn’t affect me  and to me that’s wrong
good,"If it wasn't for the culture of the company, I would've quit much sooner than I did. One of my favorite things about the company is their devotion to their customer's happiness and ensuring that they are satisfied with their time at Publix. As a people-pleaser, it's something I loved being a part of. The reputation of the company also made me proud to work for Publix, I loved telling people who I worked for. "
good,"In the beginning of my career at publix I was Happy, management and coworker love how, I work  the compliments every day, and I became experienced discrimination, no integrity, no respect, included management, and discouragement and harrassment, and I quit the job."
good,Being busy in a sense of feeling rushed and having to be very alert. Workers are nice and the environment is good the only issue is the typical retail issue when it's busy it's really busy.
good,Publix is a good job for someone needing one but it can be a tedious one so you will constantly have to have some kind of work going on so you wont become tired
good,I feel that it can always improve like any job. I at first enjoyed but after a while the vibe of the store went down.  I am looking for a people centered job.
good,Pretty bad on the pay and hours I was hired as a beer so I got payed less than a cashier but I quickly learned and started running the cashier on y own and for various full length shifts they would put me on a cashier and never pay me like one.
good,was a typical warehouse job that had great benefits. Great managers and team players. The job was a very friendly place to work that provided lunch daily for all of there employees.
good,Publix was nice when I started working there. I was doing 40 hours a week until the change mostly all the managers in every department then it went down hill. Managers have a big role in the store and if they can’t do their job good then good luck.
good,"Publix is usually a good place to work but I wouldn't make it a career. It's a great place to start and earn money when you're in high school but if you're trying to make a career of Publix, go for it. Management is not bad but it all depends on who you are working with. My Store Manager is not very good and he is too cheap to hire more workers. The departments at my store have been begging for more workers and my store manager is too cheap and lazy to do so. The company also did away with bonuses for their coworkers so that only management gets the bonuses. Everyone is also easily replaceable at Publix. If someone quits, another comes in to fill the void. Publix is a great place to start off your career and if you want to be part of Publix for the rest of your life, go for it. Otherwise, if you want a job more suited to your college degree, like me, find a better job."
good,"As a customer service representative I answer calls, handle complaints, send western unions and process money orders, help other departments and coordinate the daily tasks of employees."
good,Publix is a great place to work but even stores that are only a couple miles apart can be ran really different and the clientele is very different the deli is a very stressful place and bakery can be understaffed as well as a deli
good,"There are people who have been with Publix for 5+ years at my store and are still stuck at the cash register, then in walks a seventeen year-old new hires who become staff by their eighteenth birthday."
good,"It is a very good place for starters,  although the salary is small but since there is room for advancement you don't need to worry."
good,This place is a good place to work and make money but sometimes the calls are not the best. Prepare to be micromanaged like you've never been micromanaged before. I would recommend it
good,"Helping Customers check out, find what they need."
good,"I followed my procedures as needed. I helped customers and ensured satisfaction. I created desired items: deli subs, chicken, salads, and platters,.ect. to satisfactory quality."
good,"I was employed at this company when I was 16, therefore it was my first job while I was in high school. They taught me the ropes about customer service, which has been a wonderful skill and knowledge to have."
good,"Typical day at Publix, you are overstaffed, and workers are often stressed due to trying so hard to provide great customer service as well as attempt to be efficient and keep the bosses happy."
good,I learned how to use customer service properly and pretty much every day is the same for me which is stressful and irritating most of the time and the management is just terrible mostly because some of the managers are young as well
good,"Higher up Management at Public was incompetent for the most part (i.e. District and Store Managers), but other employees and management for the most part were enjoyable to interact with."
good,"There were so many products that were being delivered at all times, that it was constantly busy.  Monitoring shelf life, freezer and refrigerator conditions at all times, was imperative.  Monitoring expiration dates and shelf placement was important.  It was a good job."
good,"It’s not all that, but it’s a job! The associates and managers at my store can be a handful, but that’s like any other job. The customers (depending on the day) are okay!"
good,"Publix is a good place to work if you do not care about career advancement. A typical day is very customer oriented but you must also work with all of the departments as customer service staff. I learned a lot about how to defuse difficult situations with upset customers and a lot about working with a team so that your department can run smoothly. "
good,"Im in the bakery.  If I work days it is mostly packing and pricing product to put out on the floor or to customers.  It is very busy and can be nerve wracking but I enjoy the fast pace."
good,"A normal work day at Publix is pretty much planned out it consists of the same routine every single day. You are constantly doing something weather it is stalking, leveling or rotating the shelves. Going through inventory or helping out customers. It is the same thing every day nothing changes."
good,Co workers are great but you have to work hard. Not a great work life balance and the managers are only there for their bonuses and not for you at all.
good,I enjoyed working in a place with a team of active people where in a fast paste things are always moving. I learned how to use a computer pull orders to place on the conveyor belt.
good,The most recent Publix I was at was under inconsistent management. There have been two managers there in less than 4 months. The assistant manager for my department is rude.
good,". Publix provides opportunity as long as it is in the right areas. Some locations have amazing management , others areas are extremely lacking. Overall it has pros and cons."
good,"working at Publix was a good opportunity, but wasn't for me. I want a career with a company I can grow with and although Publix offers good opportunities its not the place I saw myself."
good,do not agree with some of  pharmacy dept. priorities getting away from basic customer service  Losing track of overall mission.   Too much interference and micro management of pharmacy
good,The work that is given for you to do on your own is alarming. They expect so much with so little time. The only good thing about the job is you can move up the chain but you have to be there for years
good,"A typical day at work was pretty standard as far as what had to be done everyday.  I didn't really learn anything that I didn't already know .  Management was very aloof and non communicative as far as your job performance.  In my case, I would get a ""good job"" or ""nice work"" every so often.  But when it came time to give reviews for job performance in order to get a raise, then you hear all these negative things that you weren't told any time before.  The workplace culture was pretty pleasant.  I never had issues with fellow employees.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with unreasonable expectations from management.  The most enjoyable part were the employees in my department that I worked with.  They were helpful and friendly."
good,"A typical day at Publix can include unpredictable customers, and I have learned that you can never show the managers and especially the customers that you as an associate that you are feeling the pressure because Publix is all about providing premier customer service. The hardest part of my job is learning how to adjust to new management and new rules while learning who I am outside of the workplace. However, the most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers, knowing I made their lives somewhat easier"
good,Its a starter job its the job that helps you pay your phone bill maybe by your first car if you save up.There is a chance to grow with the company if you choose that route in life.
good,"A typical day at work was coming in at various times morning or afternoon and bagging customers groceries, then assisting them to their vehicles and loading them in.  Some days I worked ten hours doing this repetitively. I learned customer service skills and teamwork.  I learned the meaning of  sense of urgency. The work place culture was fitting for extroverted personalities. Small talk is their cup of tea and service is their bread n butter. The hardest part of the job was pushing carts and making sure you don't run into a customer when entering the doors. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside happy go lucky co-workers. In Ponte Vedra sometimes they stick you with cleaning 5 bathrooms. They do not allow you to take tips and you must be clean shaven."
good,"A lot of times with this job, although it pays well, it is hard to get more than 15 or 20 hours a week. A lot of times, it has to do with who is managements favorite at the time, but management is prone to cycling in and out and transferring between stores often. However, a majority of the customers that come in and out of the store are regulars and people that are dedicated to and love Publix and the environment so it becomes very easy to build relationships with these customers. Depending on your luck, there is usually even an opportunity to make a connection with your fellow employees, especially since Publix does not have a very high turnover rate. These factors makes an enjoyable working experience overall."
good,"Good pay with possibility to increase, good benefits and (hopefully, depends of course on the store) good work environment. A bit on the strict side but a job is a job."
good,"It’s been a good time working at Publix for a year but now I’m not feeling right working here because I have good skills like fast pace working and lifting heavy objects from place to another. My job as a bagger is not the kind of job i want and Publix has many people already taking higher positions that get paid more. Also it’s been kind of hard dealing with closing shifts which is what they always want me to do and I go to technical school which is waking up 6 o clock in the morning and it’s hard to get a good night with closing shifts. I need a better job that can put my good skills in good use, I’m not saying that Publix is bad place to work I’m saying it’s not good enough job to work for me, so I need a job that can make feel like I’m good enough to be part of like team and be able to push my skills for my future career"
good,Getting to know a lot about different kind of cheeses and wine sampling two customers was a fun experience for me also slicing them with string instead of nice was exciting.
good,"Wouldn’t allow me to drink water nor go to the restroom. just not a company for me to work for due to the lack of people skills the management has. other than that, decent company to work for."
good,"Very good nice place to work, Good  customers service, Friendly great associates, Making  friends Along the way, Love products nice clean environment."
good,"Great environment, very friendly customers and some not very friendly. Excellent customer service flexible schedule and a great management staff. great place"
good,"Short on hours, busy, a lot of days without lunch/bathroom breaks. New supervisor was expecting me to know everything right away and was not willing to teach me more."
good,It was tiring into a bad place to work they keep changing the rules to the point where you don’t know if you are coming or going . So it made the job stressful
good,Could be better. Work hard and dont get much for it. Could be somewhere where they appreciate you but it's not like that at all. I work and get nothing so.
good,if you are a high school kid looking for a job to start out then this job is for you. it takes quite sometime to move up in the chains mail because of favoritism
good,"as far as company, very good company to work for as far as beneifts and growth with in the company."
good,"keeping the customer happy with products are produce items on the shelf."
good,"Everything is a facade to make the company look nice."
good,Publix is a good company to work for depending on what type of managers you have a typical day at work is dealing with customers hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers with attitudes.
good,"Overall my experience within the 5 years I worked for publix was interesting. I was lucky enough to be able to train in every department, however getting a full time position is very hard within the company."
good,Publix is a great company to work for. Worked there for over a year. Have paid stock opitions. They are really flexible. Open to advancement. Good options and liked the management.
good,"fast paced job, keeps you on your feet need more staffing. great customers 90 percent of the times."
good,"It's great for a first time employee. I wouldn't necessarily put all my eggs into this basket. But, I guess if you enjoy retail and would like benefits this is the way to go."
good,Publix was a temporary job that I enjoyed overall. The staff and management was great to work with daily. I would recommend this job to anyone looking for a full or part time job.
good,i bag clean floor and get carts management is very organized the most enjoyable part of the job is that its like working with a family the hardest part of the job would be selling trees
good,"Working in the Deli is probably the hardest jobs in Publix. You provide none stop customer service from open to close. Teamwork is key in this department. Management can be good or bad depending on what type of person your manager is, but most of the management is pretty great overall. Everyone works hard and strives to do the best of their abilities. The most enjoyable part about the job, for me, is the people I work with and how understanding everyone can be. When you join a Publix team, you are joining a family. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with customers, cleaning, and sales. You must know how to multitask and you have to be quick."
good,Publix is a good company. However this company is not the company it use to be when it first started. The company has got away from the family part of it. Depending on your manager at your store is depending on how your schedule will be and rather the managers will work with your schedule.
good,"The hours were not as consistent as I would like them to be. Work days were long, but they did have an our break. Management could try to help an individual succeed more, that is a con."
good,Interesting Company;Fast paced environment; Great Customer Service skills a must; Clean atmosphere for customers and employees; Typical day at work assisting customers with products;
good,my job is great i have been at publix for over 11 years now and there i a lot that needs to be improved for the employees. One is to have a dedicated site for pharmacy jobs available in the area.
good,Overall good place to work long hard hours great managers great crew to work with if you want to work in a fast-paced environment this is the company for you long hours Fair benefits great family time to hang out with your family and friends
good,"For me, i've had a hard time trying to advance in a decorators position in the bakery. it requires a lot of pushing and pestering to move up from what i gathered from others"
good,Its been a while not sure really. But thing I would say is publix is better in a certain things than whole foods. Nice place to work  after all. Lots of things has changed since I left.
good,Publix is a good place to work for young teens who are still in high school. It is not a career because promotions are few on far between. Plus customers are very rude.
good,"Publix as a company is a good place to work. It sincerely depends on your fellow associates and the managers that oversee you. It can vary from store to store, and from department to department. If you're in a busy store with high turnover, it can be really difficult to manage. In a good store, it can feel like you're forming another family."
good,"Publix prides itself on taking care of their customers. If the customer is not satisfied, then Publix is not satisfied. A great place to work! A great place to shop!"
good,"Publix is a good place to work. Every place has good and not so great people. Great benefits. It'd be nice if they allowed employees to decently express themselves with hair and small piercings. Not sure how they are now, but when I worked in the bakery there was only one person to close (need at least 2, maybe 3 during the holidays). It was ridiculous."
good,"there is nothing wrong with working for publix. like in any job out there, its all about who you work with and who is leading the office. if you have good staff surrounding you, it can be tolerable."
good,"great place to work. They expect your dedication if you want to advance. Advancement can be slow in some areas. Great benefits, but they want your availability to be wide open, 24/7."
good,Publix has a lot of obstacles in its way to achieve maximum profits. There's only one variable that a company can kind of control to keep a profit margin high and that's through payroll. Everybody is different and will have their own first hand experiences. Publix might be for them or not. It is a good stepping stone to either continue a path with publix or break off and use the knowledge that you learned to benefit yourself.
good,Shopping at publix is a pleasure but working there is a different experience.  I worked at publix for 18 years and I rarely received a raise.  The managers were disgusting. They never cared about their employees. Working at publix was quite an experience but overall it was okay because of the excellent customers. There are good people out there. I would not recommend anyone to work at publix long term because it is not worth the headache.
good,"I work in the bakery.  I was hired to be an apprentice Baker, but the new manager brought their friends to the newly opened store and I was made a clerk.  Immaturely I dove in head first, learning rapidly and out performing every task  given.  This was replaced with zero help on jobs that required two people, closing alone every night or opening every day.  If there was a mistake made on a day I was not there, I was reprimanded and delegated to spread the news, such I refused."
good,"I always had the night shift and left really late and next morning I had school early and I think that the hardest part for me was leaving at 1 or 2 in the morning to go home sleep 4-5 hours and go back to school. There is nothing to enjoy in the job unless your associates or yourself make it enjoyable. Some manager are annoying other are good then other are really cool as any person. This being my first job I can say I learned a lot and mature with this job. I became more responsible, organize, dependent, etc... Also I learned to better communicate with other people and learned how to react if something bad happens or in case of an accident."
good,"The store I worked at needed a lot of help, managers were ignoring some of the things their employees were doing.  Wasn't structured and the equality was low, which didn't help the work environment mentally."
good,Good job with room for advancement if you have the patience. Fair play but not good pay. A lot of good people work there. Management was good when I started but not as good when I left. The management staff is mostly different since I worked there also.
good,They taught me a lot about culinary and food prep skills. The atmosphere is positive and friendly for the most part. It can be extremely stressful with the lack of staffing
good,"came in did my work independently. enjoyed the customers and my co workers. not stressful, help maintain equipment, and enjoyed working.  pay could have been better."
good,"there was no hard part of the job, it was mostly family oriented and a friendly place to work, nice calm people work in all sections of the supermarket."
good,"The best thing about working for Publix is that they give stock as part of compensation. The stock pays a dividend and has historically really increased in value, splitting several times over the last 20-30 years. However, that seems to be changing drastically as stock price has been stagnant the last 2-3 years, and shows no signs of the huge increases that were seen 10 or 20 years ago."
good,"Overall the job was alright, but for anybody who wasn't making this their full time career and getting to either a department lead or an assistant manager, it wasn't worth it at all. The pay was just over minimum wage, and the whole atmosphere gets to you. While there were a few managers throughout the store who would have your back when somebody was acting over the top or screaming at you for doing your job, most of the time managers would come over and just give them free stuff. I got 3 complaints from my managers about not smiling while my line was empty and I wasn't doing anything. Once you reach full time (if you can), and get to a position like a lead or department manager, its a fantastic career with a solid salary and benefits, but if you're looking for temporary work, or this doesn't pertain to your major, I'd look for something else."
good,Great benefits but you only get the full benefit of it if you are fulltime. Good management team will make a pleasant working experience. Great customer service is a company standard
good,"Publix prides itself in not laying people off but that allows bad managers to be passed from one store to another. Bad pay, no overtime, they'll work you until they toss you."
good,"Publix has given me many opportunities to learn new things and advance. They are very flexible with the hours, especially when I was a college student at USF."
good,Publix is a awesome job for a student that is in high school but as far as an adult it didn’t really help me much for salary wise. Especially by me paying for school I didnt think it benefited me as an adult.
good,"The environment of the store was overall good. The hours were good for me and I liked working with the other employees."
good,"Wouldn’t go back, said it was employed own and they never asked our opinion . Always changing things and everyone wasn’t on the same page. One would tell you one thing and another would tell you something else"
good,"I like the store atmosphere but don’t like how much the pay is, I also like that you work with everyday I don’t think it’s for me , I wish to find a store"
good,"i would of stayed but nothing got better over the months. I worked in the Deli department, honestly one of the hardest departments. It was hard for me to get a break and even go to the bathroom because we were so short staffed. No one would  stay, once people would notice how hard it was to work behind the counter they up and quit. And never go home on time."
good,"working at pubix was always fun and fast paced. The workers were very friendly, and the culture was very professional. Great customer service was a must."
good,A very fast paced day working to rotate product properly. Loading and unloading product in a timely manner. Can be very gratifying at the end of the day.
good,"I started working at publix the summer before my senior year, it was pretty good being a bagger. I was doing so well my store manager asked me to help the produce department, so I accepted. I enjoyed working there up until this summer. I began to realize things arent exactly fair. Getting full time is like you have to beg the manager, I'm not doing that.  The work is pretty simple, but, it's the associates or managers that make the job very horrible."
good,"It was ok, That was my first job, that where it all started , a great company to work for , great benefit ,and potential growth with the company, so that was a plus."
good,All employees are nice and easy to get along with.... there is room for advancement and full time employment if you wanted to advance.  Very much a customer oriented company.
good,At work on a typical day there are around 200 carts to push in the store as they constantly leave. The staff is really nice.The hardest part of the job is getting the carts in the store because you're probably on your own outside for an hour.
good,"Publix is  good company to work for they help with alot of things like  schooling ,cars,phones ,and good stocks bounds over all i like publix  and i like working there"
good,I liked Publix but then I didn’t my mangment team changed and I had rude management and I didn’t get consistent hours all the time they would get mad at you for something and cut your hours.
good,"Worked at Harbison Publix which was too far for part-time employment and too many schedule changes, moved  from early mornings to late evenings constantly, the manager that was difficult to work for is no longer there, otherwise the other employees were great to work with."
good,Poor leadership in management allowing for chaos of the front end which has created huge loss of great employees. People aren’t appreciated for the work they do. Shifts are long with not enough breaks and people are getting injuries that could be avoided. Unwillingness to work with peoples changes with life and families expecting them to fit a perfect square when part time employees are part time so they can have the flexibility. Pay does not reflect people’s efforts and work abilities. Advancements would be rewarded to those with less tenor  or as rewards for info about day to day happenings. Not the TEAM we signed up to work for with hopes of advancing careers. Critique the little things when the bigger issues should be main focus which creates for a hostile environment.
good,"its good for your first job. it used to be better, they used to give better benefits and would give you stock based on your hours, but no more. you can move up too but its all about who you know, not what you know. since you don't need an education to get promoted a lot of the managers are uneducated."
good,"They require you to shave and cut your hair unless you mention that it's a part of your religion. I feel its useless to shave unless you were working in the food departments (Meat, Deli, Bakery). Management does care about the employees only if you can slave away for little to no change. They only care for numbers, the company is no longer taking care of the employees; using the workers for years working them in part-time hours for years instead of promptly giving them promotions. Its sad when the older employees would exposing all the company issues and problems among each other."
good,To start the day off we would usually see what had to be unloaded from the trucks first thing in the morning. usually what was unloaded from the trucks had to be put out that day so we did that and it took up a majority of our day.
good,Overall just too many people working there. Not enough space for people to work so some employees get all the hours while others will get 2 or 3 shifts a week. Very unbalanced.
good,"this job requires a huge amount of patience. For the most part, you'll get to work with great people and managers that are very understanding. very flexible hours and tuition reimbursement for various business majors."
good,You must be able to work fast in this pharmacy. staff is hard on you if you work to slowly. It was hard to fit in and I just could not get into circle and felt like an outsider
good,"Typical Day at work was enjoyable"
good,I worked there as a mechanic its a good place to work but the pay scale is below standard and it takes about 7-10 yrs to progress thru the pay scale. there is very limited training they always have openings for mechanics
good,"I have nothing to really say. Publix at some point is a good place to work when you reach store management levels, but all other positions are a struggle pit."
good,"I moved three different stores before I was finally promoted to a meat cutter. How often the rules change can be good and bad, depending on what the rule is. "
good,"I love Publix, I am honestly tired of working for it. It becomes monotones and eventually the light inside of you dies. Overall working for Publix is not bad for a high school job, or even as an after retirement option. But I am just finally tired of working there, especially with the managers that I deal with."
good,"Amazing People To work with, people love you For You bagging wasn’t what I was expecting but I did it anyway because money is money and I definitely needed it"
good,"The store I worked at was not one of the better Publix and the department I worked in was awful. The manager didn't know what she was doing and was hurting the finances of the department. She continually gave employees who broke rules and didn't show up more hours, and she was very lazy, trying to pawn her work off on others. If the managers are better, which they probably are by now, it's a good place to work. They have good benefits and a reward employees well."
good,"It's retail to expect it to be tedious. There will be plenty of entitled customers because it's a little more expensive than some of the competition. However it is really nice to be up for a raise every 6 months, which isn't too hard to get. I personally got a 50 cent raise every time because I scored slightly above average in most of the categories."
good,"Great job experience love interacting with customers helping them locate anything that they needed,Assisting customer with bagging and loading there purchases."
good,"you have to really be a certain type of person to succeed and be happy everyday at publix, the amount of work they put on one person without giving them help is beyond me, especially while the profits of the company skyrocket. It just doesnt make for a good work environment and it continues to get worse every year, as publix is profiting more and more."
good,"Having worked at 6 different stores I can definitely say that Publix can be a great place to work, but the keyword there is can. If your direct manager doesn't like you or you're shown in a negative way in those ""snapshot"" moments then it probably isn't a great place for you at that point. "
good,Great place to work. Good benefits and good retirement plan. Management helps you succeed and pushes you to work hard. Management is fair with all employees.
good,All I know is what I went through with the job I had had good  times but I did have some problems with management sometimes and sometimes it would hinder me from doing my job because it would be so much negative feedback when I was trying my absolute best but like I said everybody’s experience different but overall it’s a good paying job and a great first job.
good,Used to be fun and enjoyable very busy and fast paced but things changed and it seem to be more political and not as much geared toward the customer for mangers.
good,Good job for part-time work. Worked for Publix while I went to school. I work there once now to maintain insurance and stock. A good place to work part-time.
good,One of the few companies that offer benefts to part-timers but the only problem is that it's very hard to move into a full time position if you start off as a cashier.
good,"Publix is a good company to work for if you're willing to put in the hard work . They look for hard working people, depending on the store , it could be a really good situation or a bad one"
good,This company was a great company to work for. The opportunity for promotion is laid out right in front of you and the pay is good. There are also many job areas you can apply for within the company.
good,Working here was okay but felt like management wasn't what they wanted you to think they were. After a short time there I found out a lot about the company; and didn't like how I was treated while working there.
good,"I worked in three different departments at Publix. I liked stocking the most, it was private and less stressful. I would only go back as a stock clerk, any other department is too strict."
good,"Cashiered and Bagged groceries for 8 hours a day 5 days a week"
good,For the most part Publix was a great place to work. Co workers communicated well with each other and management. . They also have an awesome cafeteria
good,was a great place to work. then all the changes came and the company went downhill. so many people quit for the same reasons and were happier waiting tables than working for this company.
good,"Managers doesn’t really care anymore, work hard and get paid nothing with no benefits. Lots of work to do and no time giving. Worked there for 5 years and have nothing to show for my hard work"
good,There was no room for advancement. They would hire someone new before they would give their current employees a chance to move up. The worst part was not being able to get enough hours.
good,I really do not have anything I would like to put down on this screen. Everything about me employment at publix is my business and mine alone. This is very invasive.
good,I feel that Publix is a good first time job to gain experience in a work environment. There are also many ways you can grow with the company as well if you plan on making publix a career.
good,A typical day at work was taking care of customers needs. I learned how to balance all the registers and the back office. I ordered supplies and cash needed. The management was very dedicated to their jobs. Most of the employees got along together and helped out when they were needed in other departments. The hardest part of the job was having customers yelling in our face for no reason.
good,"you have to work when they need you, they always ask to work more and faster but you don't gent any extra money, sometimes you request a day off and they say not bc there are not anybody else."
good,"I feel I can and have learned a lot at publix. The people I work and have worked with are great, my managers are amazing. But I need more than part time and they're not offering it."
good,Low pay.  Don't give you enough hours. No possibility of full time work. Would be ok for someone just looking for a job to do.  Very difficult being on your feet the whole time.
good,"good starter job, good pay, good hours, good people, management...eh. customers were very eager to tell you their life story. hardest part of the job was probably standing for hours on end in one place."
good,"Publix has a slogan for potential employees, ""where working is a pleasure"". On the surface, Publix does offer great benefits for its associates, and the potential for growth can payoff, if you can grow. The pay is still near the minimum wage end of the spectrum and the chances of receiving full-time are slim. Once someone does receive full-time, their chances for moving up further are subject to seniority and a roll of the dice politics. Some stores are governed by a solid management team with grateful associates to back them up, but some stores have a poor management team that seem to fumble through daily duties. This trickles down to employees and destroys morale. Also, hours can be scarce at times which leaves many part-time associates to fend for themselves. Other than those things Publix does offer the flexibility one would need to attend to other matters in life and you are able to have a one-on-one with management if you wish. There is also a Publix around almost every corner which is a lifesaver when you are looking to work here."
good,"It was a job, I enjoyed it for the most part."
good,It was a great place to work I just needed a better job with a set schedule that gave me full time. I would definitely recommend it as a first time job.
good,"What I've learned was to greet the customer, assist if they are looking for a product go beyond to make ""where shopping is a pleasure"" and help customer who can't reach a certain item."
good,Not a bad company to work for i'm just trying to advance in my career and right now i'm in a stand still i'm try move up a company right publix is not that company.
good,"You don't do much at this job, you tend to stand around bagging for most of the day, occasionally going outside to grab a few carts. At my store and at the time I was there I thought a few managers treated employees poorly, however I heard that those managers are no longer there."
good,"Was discriminated for health condition. Was denied possibility of promotion by manager, cause of health. Let go on false accusations with no chance to counter the accusations."
good,"Just a job, but make sure you have a great management staff. I do not recommend anyone going here for a job if they want to progress. Great opportunity for any young person that's looking for a job."
good,From day one you are taught to take care of the customer. Giving them premier customer service at all times. The associates get the same treatment. Great benefits.
good,"My store's bakery department is the worst in the district, but I doubt it is as bad in other stores. Management is incompetent, but the store manager is very friendly and understanding. The managers bellow him are not so."
good,"My experience with Publix is this; if you want to commit the rest of your life to them then you will have all that you will want monetarily. "
good,It's not bad but if you want to make a career out of it make sure you enjoy retail and tolerate mean customers. Rather not say anything since it one of those jobs you go to just to work and not much else.
good,I enjoyed working with the Publix organization. The pay was except able and my coworkers were very nice. customers were very nice as well. There is opportunity to grow and move up within the company.
good,"I worked for publix as a teenager and in college, it was a good starter job. they are very flexible on hours which is nice when you're in school. management can make or break your experience."
good,Worked hard for minimum pay. The company is good but management was not trained properly and made it difficult for employees to move up.  Publix is great if you are willing to go corporate.
good,Good hours for work and good pay. sometimes keep you there until 2AM. There is favoritism and when customers are rude no manager is there to your availability.
good,"its an okay place to work, I think its not fair to some point, some have their favorites.. I think management could be better... fairness could be used more..."
good,"Publix is okay but it’s not a forever kind of job for me, it is highly possible to advance in this kind of work environment but it’s not a goal of mine."
good,"Good,great nice place to work.People are very nice to work ,excellent customer service .Great place to work and provide excellent customer service .Great benefits"
good,A typical day at Publix is busy and you have to interact with customers constantly. I learned that working as a team is important to getting the job done effectively. The mangers are very warm and friendly and take the time to get to know you personally.The environment is comfortable and I'm always engaged in conversation with my coworkers and the customers. The hardest part of the job is standing for long hours because we don't get to sit unless we are on break. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and connecting to different people and also forming strong relationships and bond with them.
good,"I learned how to interact and assist customers.   "
good,"they promise benefits and the ability to grown in the company. I got neither. actually, they didn't even pay me the salary that we discussed in the interview and my hours were never adequate to pay my bills( or the full time they had promised me). they did not work with me when I got a second job."
good,"Bag customers groceries."
good,Was a good place to work with advancement  options but just wasn’t for me. Also just a very difficult place to work part time. Also some people that work there aren’t the friendliest
good,"I was an overnight stocker, we started as the store closed and finished after it opened.  The store was always kept neat and clean, the floors were tiled, much better than today's trend of bare concrete floors."
good,"A typical day at Publix deli is Preparing food, operated cash register, ordered supplies"
good,"Publix is a great job for a young person to get into.  Over time, any full time employee will be well compensated with stock.  This said, gaining full time status and consequently access to stock options is a struggle for most.  Stock, additionally takes 5 to 10 years before any real dividends are paid.  There is a lot of money spent by the company to remind you how great they are.  This money is not spent on the employees themselves.  Work/life balance is good for nonsalaried employees.  Insurance is ok, not outstanding by any strectch."
good,Overall this company is not bad to work for. The biggest downside is that you are required to start as a part time worker. The benefits if you stay and become full time are excellent though.
good,"Publix was an excellent place to work for me. I loved the people I worked with, but while I was there at the time I believe the store manager had an issue with me because I got hired on with the help of my mother who was working there as well so she gave me a lot of issues. Otherwise I recommend working for this company and staying with them because they can take you a long way."
good,"When I first started at Publix, I loved my job and couldn't wait to go to work, now I dread it. Over the years, ever since the new CEO took over, the feeling of your corporate bosses having your back is gone. Now they constantly cut hours but keep on hiring people and putting more workload on us that is impossible for us to complete. We need more hours so that the people that know what they are doing can get things done instead of constantly having to train people who quit a week later. Retail bonuses are gone and we used to get coupons every month for something like a cupcake for free but we only see those once every other month now if we're lucky and they're now for things like $3 off of a $15 pack of greenwise chicken."
good,Very Strict on Policy
good,"If the management of the store and your department are good it's a great place to work. They change management often though, transferring them to other stores. And even if you have a legitimate complaint HR is not there to support the hourly associates even if they have an ""open door"" policy. I loved my time there under earlier management, we were competitive with other stores in the district and increased sales regularly. It can be stressful attempting to meet sales and production goals. I feel that they are moving away from what the founder envisioned and more towards a profitable at the cost of long term employees set up."
good,"When it comes to working at Publix it's not what you know only it is who you know. Publix is a great company, the benefits are good as well. If I could start over I still would choose to work there..."
good,"Underpaid for the work that expect you to complete, most managers will throw you under the bus for their own personal gain, it is almost impossible to get fired from once you are their for 90 days, but with that being said the people who don't care about the job are safe and those who actually want to work have to pick up the slack with no added pay or acknowledgement."
good,"The workload is not challenging nor do they promote learning new things. But, it is a great second job. I have had managers act unprofessional privately and in front of customers and other employees."
good,"As front service clerk, it really depends on how well you take being told you are wrong by the customers everyday. Over time regulars warm up to you bagging or scanning out their groceries. Overall a good starter job especially if the managers are helpful and willing to work with any short comings."
good,I really didn't like the managers at publix but I liked working there it was a pretty cool place I unloaded trucks by hand there I had to relocate is why I left there
good,"Publix is profitable corporation and is effectively building pharmacies in many of their old stores. Due to many online companies in the market place, Publix is having to adapt to an ever-changing retail landscape. With strong leadership, I am sure they will succeed."
good,They allowed me to learn a lot of different skills I could use in the future job employments. I would have stay long term but they would work me 39.5 hours for a month then the following week would be 25 hours. Was looking for job stability with full time. That was reason for leaving.
good,very unorganized and people are treated very badly there. its about who you know and if you become friends with management to get promotions. Managers are very unprofessional
good,Publix wasn't a bad place to work. Good pay for the area they are. The hardest part of the job can be the management but most of the time things were ok.
good,Publix is a great company to work for. Learning what the position you are working for is easy and quick with great management. The associates are friendly and very quick to help.
good,this is a normal place to work in. Takes a long time to advance in company. Most likely will start off in minimum wage. Not much excitement. Would not go back to work in Publix only if in terrible need.
good,"Publix, as you would expect, is a good starting job if you've never had a job either because you're young or what have you.  Working there is relatively easy and the managers work with you."
good,A fast paced work environment with a lack of job advancement. Quality of management varies from store to store and is often inconsistent in terms of performance. Do not look to this company as a life long career
good,"it was a easy job. I enjoyed working, you learn a lot working here and it's easy to work up to higher paid positions. I would go back to work here only in management position."
good,publix wages are nice and their hours just depend on how well you work in your department. just be on time and work with effort. co workers are annoying.
good,"The needs of employees are not always met. When enrolling in school I had my hours cut back regardless of the fact that I was only attending classes for 3 hours a day, 2 days a week."
good,Had to resign due to a medical leave of absence. Good management style. Typical day at work consisted of running the cashier. Learned to work well with others. Hardest part of job was gathering up the grocery carts.
good,Working for the publix that I was at was not the  greatest experience they want to do the work for blood and not pay you anything  they wanted you to work around the clock versus having a life the management staff that I worked with was horrible he talked down to his employees rather up to his employees it was an all-around bad experience from working in wanting to work for Publix for so many years it was not all that I expected from Publix
good,It seems that every year hours are cut at the beginning and I don't work for weeks at a time. This can not sustain my bills in the long run and it concerns me.
good,"Punctuality is very important"
good,"Nothing really negative to say. Big Easy and Woodlawn Cafe were bars that gave me work a few nights, practicing as a bartender and giving me experience working off tips."
good,"Excellent Benefits, Great Retirement Plan, Company Stock, Tuition Reimbursement, Steady Income, Decent Starting Pay, Superb Pay When In Management, Fellow Associates, Helping Others, Ability To Relocate, Ability to Move Around Different Departments"
good,"I enjoyed my time there, it was my first ever job. I learned a lot while I was there. good management team and very understanding staff. really good benifits"
good,"This is a good company to work for if you aren't overly ambitious with many ideas that you would like to see come to fruition. You will work hard and you wont be able to work from home but the pay is pretty average and the benefits are good. If you need a job and want a decent place to retire from, this is the place."
good,"Publix Supermarkets is a great place to work if you are interested in advancement, and  available  anytime. You will get more hours if you're available anytime."
good,"They will tell you about all of their wonderful benefits and how it is employee owned, but they will make sure that you don't cross the threshold of hours worked to qualify for any of that. You will spend years working your way to a department manager position just to find that the pay is meh. Most full-timers are from an era where they were a lot more willing to grant full time status. If you do a good job and keep your schedule flexible you can rack up a decent amount of hours as a part-timer though. "
good,I enjoyed my time here for my first job. It was a good first experience and I got to learn a lot about the workforce and responsibilities. I think they are quite accommodating and have room to advance.
good,"I worked as a Bagger for over 5 years. I filed out countless requests for different positions but they were always ignored. I was stuck at my position because of management. They wanted me to do multiple job positions without actually giving me the position so i was stuck with more responsibilities but at my pay rate. Baggers have the lowest pay rate in the company but are usually ""cross trained"" to do multiple positions which leads to being overworked."
good,"if you ever got full time employment at publix count yourself as one of the lucky few. it was almost impossible to get 20-25 hours a week when i was working there, they hire too many people so they dont have to pay overtime or full time employees."
good,When i worked at publix i was still in highschool. it was a standard first job. everything is kind of a blur but overall it was uneventful. not bad but not good.
good,"Honestly just hated the hours. The jobs was not fun and management wasn't receptive to me wanting to go back to school. Not enough help, wanted too much from me,"
good,"Shifts are all over the place so you have no stability in your life, shifts change daily and never have same days off and hardly ever have weekend days off.  Management gets changed way to much and managers will change the way they run departments so procedures are always changing even if company policy is a certain way the management still does what they want.  No consistency with hours or management."
good,The pay is low but it's a reasonably good place to work especially for a first job. Would not recommend for those of light social hearts. Most managers are good but some can be very lazy.
good,"Publix is a company to work for if you arelooking for great benefits.  It is just like any other large corporation though, you get lost in the daily flow and management recognition is poor."
good,"Publix is a great way to learn new skills. If you want to grow in the company and learn new skills, let the management know and they will help you climb the ladder to success."
good,"Customers can be a handful at some points of the year, but just be yourself and enjoy those around you that you work with. They can be life long friends."
good,Pleasure to work for. Teamwork worked there for 13 yrs. Time commitment. Always go above and beyond. Always traveled to different stores to see how they all worked.
good,Publix was a great place for me to work while i was working on my degree after getting out of the military. The managers where very friendly and worked with me around my school schedule along with giving me hours.
good,"Under new management from above, it became all about numbers and not about customer service and safety. More work and less help. Nothing to set Publix pharmacy apart from the big name chain stores except less money."
good,"Depending on which area code you work in with Publix, depends on how you get treated at the store you work at.  Not all managers are the same but a lot of the managers are young, lack good judgment and understanding. Great benefits for the most part."
good,The people were nice and you became familiar with same members. Pay is low. Nice working Mon-Fri and having weekends off. The branch manager has been there since it started so he is well known and can be a bit strict sometimes.
good,"If you work at a Publix that is low on people in your department, then there is no way around it. You will have to stay late and have to work harder to pick up the slack for the people you don't have to help you. And you have to do this every time you work until you get people,so it is very easy to get burned out. But all stores are different. I've been to multiple stores and not all of them are bad. In fact one I went to was amazing. But my store in general just gets suffocated by the lack of experienced people, or managers not cracking down on the people that aren't pulling their weight,"
good,It’s a  family friendly place to Work and the people are really friendly. But it’s a good job if u starting off this is a good beginner. The food is the bomb and the sandwiches are so delicious.
good,"Publix is a great place to start a career if you are not willing to seek a degree, the people are typicaly hard working. I work in Orlando and its a good start for someone looking for part time work while atte nding college."
good,"My over all review of Publix is that you really have to work hard and fast to get the job done there. Sometimes you work as a team, But a lot of the times the load can be throne on one or two people during certain times of the day and on delivery days can be very overwhelming at times. If you have a good working relationship with the staff - pulling together and working as a team is the best way to get the grocery loads done like HV & LV which means High Velocity goods and Low Velocity goods... HV is items that sells the most and LV is items that takes a little long to move off the shelf's. In any company there can be better ways to perform and make the work load enjoyable. best of luck in your Job search."
good,"Its a great company to work for and it was my first job. I stayed for five years and am interested in doing something new. A normal day at Publix means you can be in any department on any given day if help is needed, because of this i have experience in the grocery department stocking shelves."
good,Full of interesting and creative people who are ready to work and provide the best service possible. Great for someones first job and fairly flexible management
good,"This company talks a lot about how great it is to work at it, and then turns around and stabs long-time employees in the back. They continuously say that they're all about keeping the family together and then don't even give you a 5% discount."
good,This job is good for young people looking to make a little bit of extra cash. By no means can you support yourself or a family off the income you receive at publix.
good,"They started cutting technician help and giving us more metrics to meet. Managments response to our complaints is ""just deal with it"" attitude. Very stressful environment"
good,you are well paid for your contributions. at the same time they are not so considerate of the physicality of the job at the warehouse. over all you learn alot about the warehouse environment.
good,I enjoyed my time with Publix. I got along with everyone in store. I became ill and needed some time off to adjust to new medication. The DM became irate that I needed the time off to adjust and told my MM to terminate me. Not only did I resign but the MM did as well.
good,"Productive and fun place to work with flexible scheduling, excellent benefits package and an opportunity for career advancement. Raises were typically given annually."
good,"Basically, it's new regional management marking their territory trying to make a statement. I'm NOT impressed with new wave of management. Good luck....."
good,Publix Deli is a very fast paced environment.  The training within the Deli Department could improve greatly. Loved the interaction with customers and fellow employees.
good,Pblix is a great company with a lot of opportunity to grow and advance. Just give 100% and you will sow the benefits of working for one of the best companies.
good,Publix is a great place to work. You can make a lot of money really fast. Great staff. Management is really supportive. Please don't never try to leave they will beg you to stay.
good,Publix is a great Career to have. They have many different positions you can grow. They have good benefits to choose from for you and your family members.
good,"i was young, and it was my first job. the pay was low. but i thought it was great because i did not know any better. but its a great place to start a work experience for a young person."
good,"I believe Publix Supermarkets is a great place to work. The customers and associates are great. The job can be stressful when you not given adequate training, but co-workers and manager are always there to help you. The biggest downside to working at Publix in Customer Service is it can be extremely difficult to get a full-time position, and move up within the company. The lack of a full-time position for myself as recent college graduate has forced me to look elsewhere."
good,I enjoyed publix the only problem I had with it was the customer service manager mixed her feelings with her work and it always caused problems between her and the other employees other than that working there was good the coworkers are easy to get along with and the managers are always there to help you l.
good,needs better management my managers sucked hours are flexible don't expect to move up in the company unless you were there before someone else with the same position
good,"I stocked shelves, participated in inventory counts, and coordinated distribution from the trucks deliveries to the shelves. It was a job right out of high-school."
good,"I enjoy working for Publix.  Sometimes it is stressful, but any job with the public is stressful.  Management treats us fairly well. I want to stay with Publix and move up."
good,Workplace is ok. I have learned alot working there. This was the first job I have ever worked with food. The managers are o.k. The hardest part of the job is when you have to work tell 11pm then back into work at 5am. That doesn't happen every often.
good,"If you come to work with a negative mindset, you will get a negative outcome and view of yourself. treat other like you would like to be treated. Do not come to work feeling like you are entitled of your position."
good,"People I worked with were cool, just lazy. They aren't the best at scheduling so there were quite a few times I was the only person closing my department. Management is nice and relaxed."
good,"If you are excellent with time management, great at delegating work, and love to train your entire staff to excel then this job will be a piece of cake and you will move up the ranks easily. If not, then you must get use to living in a loop of dealing with the customer and associate problems alike on a daily basis."
good,"I have many friends (co-workers) that have all left Publix shortly after I did 8 years ago.  The unreal demands placed on retail pharmacist's time have really taken away from the appeal of this job.  Little to no time is spent with the patient.  For a while, Publix was a better retail pharmacy to work for, then it became like everyone else."
good,Publix is actually a good company to work for but they need to make better choices when it comes to management but overall there is room for growth and opportunity
good,"Come in set up our line, label cups, weigh out product. Send down conveyor belt. Box products and place on pallet. I learned how to keep up the pace with the more experienced workers. The management do not treat the temps fairly. The work environment is not friendly, the workers are not eager to help the new people. The work is very easy, but we never get our 40 hours"
good,"Hours were not normal 2am-10am, staff was fun to work with for the most part and helping customers when the store opened was great.Pay wasn't the best."
good,"Most days are work are pretty stressful and busy. There are rude customers and there are your normal and you have to deal with them as they come. It can be rough some days and there is a lot of multi tasking involved. With school, they are flexible with the hours. The hardest part of the job is the rude customers."
good,I do customer service at Publix. I enjoy helping customers and solving problems. The hardest part is dealing with difficult customers but it's worth it. I am not a big fan of the management and feel things can be done a little differently to be more beneficial.
good,managers were on salary but made to work VERY LONG hours so they were miserable.  Warehouse had large fans but unable to be air conditioned because doors were always opened to pull empty trailers in building to load.  I sometimes did sanitation when needed and I enjoyed having a variety of job duties.
good,Easy keeping daily production of 80%. Must stay on task in order to keep a percentage over 80. Learned to love the job to be successful. Management doesn't work as a unit. Each manager manage differently. Most enjoyable part o the job is free lunch.
good,Publix is a great place to work when you have a full team of hard working people. When you have managers who actually do their job and help others succeed.
good,it is not the worst place in the world to work as long as you are not in the deli because if you are in that  hole then you might want to start drinking and deal with it.
good,they are a little intolerant of people who have chronic health problems such as diabetes. and have to miss work ....they turn a cold shoulder and one feels helpless.
good,"Honestly, tuition reimbursement was the only reason why I stated working at this company. hours were unstable and the pay is too low to survive without working full time."
good,more fulltime I work very hard and train a lot of my associates with no award. I wish my manager was more understand about the way we feel. And I do a excellent job on my evaluation to only get twenty-five cent for every six months.
good,"Publix used to be a place where the care of employees seems genuine. Now it's all about corporate money and taking away from what we used to have that made our company stand out in the nation. It's a decent place to work while in high school, while attending college, or for retirement. I would not consider working here as a career."
good,They don't give enough hours. The managment has their favorites and give the hours to those they favor. Spoke to management numerous of times to get more hours. Eventually I left.They don't pay you enough to consider it a career. Good for students.
good,I really enjoyed working at publix as a grocery clerk. The people that i worked with made the job alot better. had a great team of people i worked with
good,"Work here was fun and challenging, advancement was there it was just slow compared to some other companies. I would recommend this to a new person seeking somewhere to start."
good,"Benefits are great, pay is good, but promotions are unfortunately highly political. No type of work life balance for a single parent or a person with a family"
good,"Not treated fair, a lot of favoritism was going on. Can't really go to the bathroom as much. They keep you longer than scheduled if the person taking over is really late."
good,they sucked the managers only cared for people that kissed butt and when I came back from the service it took me calling corporate to get my job back.
good,Publix  is a nice and warm place to work when working with the right group of people. I learned even better customer service skills as was able to work in a department outside of my comfort Zone.
good,"Be smart, start young with Publix and sell your soul in Retail and you will do very well.  Come in as a line professional from another industry and you could get stuck.  Even lateral moves with related experience and Publix will ask that you  give money back.  This company loves to test individuals in math, reading comprehension, analytical skills, so make sure you brush up or the kids coming out of college will have an advantage.  They already look attractive because of their lower pay.  They will test you regardless of how long you have been with the company, providing a constant advantage to those coming out of school.  You can do it, just stay sharp!"
good,"Fun place to work with associates but day to day the demands for satisfaction increase.  The pay is very low, and with the recent changes to bonus structure it does not provide for a stable financial lifestyle for living.  The company culture voices a lot about the opportunities for advancement with company but does not offer a fair selection or opportunity for internal employees at the store level. I would like to see more of the culture changed to the traditional where everyone was treated more like family throughout the whole organization."
good,I have been with the company for 12 years always on time never call out and still do not make enough to live. Long hours some times with only a 30 min  lunch.  Lazy coworkers still are given raises
good,"I worked for a company that provided maintenance for the Publix Stores.  We did not report directly to Publix.  I enjoyed this position, but unfortunately the company closed down."
good,"Publix requires focus and hard work, I learned to give customers a satisfying experiences and customer service. The management is understanding sometimes and polite. The hardest part of the job is not knowing what your going to walk in the days you work; meaning dealing with mixed personalities. The most enjoyable part of my job is making customers happy and making sure they have everything they need."
good,"Publix is a great company to work for, if you start working there at a very young age and never leave. Pay isn't great and is just not enough to live off of for those of us who are a little older, are trying to live on our own and have children. Great environment to work in with mostly great co-workers and management."
good,"The work here is very fast-paced. As soon as you clock in you are immediately decorating cakes and cupcakes while, at the same time, making sure the cake orders are correct and ready on time for the customers pick up."
good,"My typical day consisted of unloading carts, bagging groceries, and providing carry out service to customers who wanted or needed it. It was a fine place to work"
good,Looking to getting out of the retail world.  It is a good grocery store to work for if and fantastic with working around your school schedule with job security intact.
good,It was a okay place to work if it's you're first  job. You do get breaks. Only problem I ever had was they were always hiring people so you don't get as many hours.
good,"It's an amazing place to work but you don't get paid as much as you should for the work you do. You also don't get benefits unless you work 1,500 hours between your hire date. They make it very hard to reach that goal as a part-time employee and it's very unfair. My time working there I worked almost every department, 30-40 hours a week sometimes a little more and only got paid $8.75 to do it. It was very unfair but if you like to just have a good place to work with an accepting environment, I would still recommend Publix as the place for you."
good,The starting pay and benefits are pretty good. The schedule is ever-changing so that is a negative for me. Getting into the right department is very important but you can always move. It's pretty much like every other big corporation.
good,"Nice working place with multicultural environment those touched by different kind of nationality friendly colleages, for instant ; spanish, Haitian,Korean etc."
good,"publix has great benefits as far as the stock, the pay could be better, it is a good company to work for. hours could be better though. you get great retirement benefits,"
good,I first enjoyed working here but I honestly got bored of my job really fast. I like jobs that are different and exciting. Unfortunately doing the same thing everyday is boring to me.
good,"after leaving publix for a year with another company i soon realized that it was a terrible mistake. i wish that i were able to return to my old job,."
good,"I worked in the deli; slicing meat, making sandwiches, party trays and serving customers what they needed. And doing whatever management wanted me to do."
good,"Good place to work, decent pay, advancement is hard to get at first, it's a good company overall, though the company culture is changing and heading to a more publicly owned culture."
good,"Daily responsibilities included stocking, tracking inventory, managing product.  Excellent team of coworkers.  Enjoyed providing the best cust srvc possible."
good,I learned a lot at publix I learned how to decorate cakes which I now do for my own parties. management was okay I just didn't see a lot of promotions though.
good,Publix is a good place to work unfortunately the hours are inconsistant. I loved working there the people are great and the place is nice and clean. The only downside iis the inconsistant hours.
good,They were what made me not like this job.  I would be in the middle of working on something and they would come up to me and ask me to do their job. I became irritated and told them I was busy and that they would have to do on there own.
good,"come in and do what you got to do and go home"
good,you are over worked atleast in the deli they want you to follow great expectations but arnt willing to give you decent pay for it they treat there employees like slaves
good,"I had a few people that were amazing and made sure life was great, Then there are the problems, of its not my job you do it. It was a good but sometimes not the best management"
good,"This is a good place to start working, easy to get and keep. Don't get alot of hours at the beginning but when you prove yourself you will get more. Doesn't pay very well and raises are few and far in between."
good,It's a good job to work at starting off but I wouldn't want to make a career out of it. Friendly people but the benefits aren't that good. Over all its decent.
good,"Fast-paced culture that is conducive to learning. "
good,"Deli is the worst department to work for in Publix. You have to wash and clean everything every night. And the payment is not fair at all. 9$ an hour. "
good,Great company if you finds ways to move up the chain. Find a manager who will push for you or you may get stuck in a unsatisfactory posistion. There is no typical work day considering you're dealing with different  customer personalities every hour.
good,customer service work. Where working is a pleasure. It was interesting. It has some good employees. It was just publix change that helped customers see them.
good,"publix is changing overall as a company, high demands with little rewards besides benefits. Great people to work with but they have been adding too much responsibility for the managers"
good,"If you're planning to make a career out of one company, Publix is a decent place to stay - if you don't mind possibly having to relocate and play the politics game. Some people really like that and do well. I'm just not the sort of person who likes to bend over for every young kid freshly promoted into management with no common sense and too much ego."
good,The team members are very knowledgeable and professional and willing to go the extra mile to assist internal or external customers.  This organization routinely provides relevant and comprehensive training to its employees.
good,Great first job. Very good schedule for a student. The high paced environment made the day go by quickly. The managers were very professional and consistent.
good,This was a good job for me during high school.  Pays well and good benefits.  Awful place to work if you have a family.  Bad hours and they don't care.
good,Publix has really good benefits and is a good company to work for. They do a lot of charity events which are actually a lot of fun to attend. They do a lot of good for the community.
good,"Publix is a great company to work for if you are in school orn just for part time.   I would not recommend Publix if you have a family.  It is retail and the hardest part of the job is holiday season, you have to be able to handle lots of customer complaints and sometimes very angry customers...   Must have a great personality for this job and be able to take orders from people."
good,"its retail...pays well if you climb the ladder but any education or technical trade skill will be faster, pay better, and not be as humilating as babysitting and training kids that will soon be educated and leave, or dum dums that are stuck in retail"
good,"My experience here was okay. I worked here for nine years and made it known that I was interested in full time several times throughout my time here. I was told because I was going to college that they wouldn't give me full time. I switched departments a few times just to get full time and it was never given to me. You have to kiss the managers' butts if you want to get anywhere. They go by who they like, not who works the hardest and does their job properly."
good,Working at publix is a great job I worked with forklifts palots levers I stock things all day lift big boxes I close ever night sometimes mornings very flexible work schedule
good,"The two best fighters there held hands every day while bullying me immunely because I provided great customer service which in turn WASN'T actually a fight to the death, so they had an excuse why I shouldn't have a girlfriend (who worked there, hehe) at all times. So ya, it actually turned out everyone besides me looked like real, loud and proud homosexuals."
good,A Typical day working at Publix is you clock in of course then me being a cashier I go to my designated cashier. All you do is stand in one place for hours ring up customers and ring up coupons. Usually you deal with crazy coupons that threaten your job when they don't get a coupon their not supposed to get but besides that it's decent. The Management in my experience has not been the best. the schedules are always messed up we loose hours on constant and they sometimes don't even get the workplace schedule right (meaning that most people have no idea which register to go to/ whose getting them for their lunch break things like that). the Employees are amazing but the managers are not so much obviously it isn't always all the managers it's only one or two rotten tomatoes that make the whole bunch bad The hardest part of the job is the coupons. There are so much things you need to remember about coupons and customers are always trying to trick you to get the coupon they want. Also they will continuously hire more people and cut hours when I got hired I've gotten 35 hours max for part time for 3 months until they hired 14 more people which dropped my hours to below 10 a week.
good,It's a good place to work. Staff was helpful and catering to new employee. Only really had issue with new manager. She lacked some training in diversity training and was insensitive and made the environment less than pleasant to work in.
good,"I've been with Publix Supermarket Inc. Since September of 1994 and worked my way up thru the ranks to have the opportunity to do what I came there for, to be a truck driver."
good,"Nice people and management, but given tedious tasks and hard labor for low pay. Only recommend working here as career opportunity. Working at Publix part time will not be worth the money for the amount of cleaning, displaying, customer service, and possibly heavy lifting required for the job."
good,"Sometimes a great place to work, sometimes an awful place to work. I worked in three different stores. Out of the three one was a great place to work and the management was great. The other 2 one was okay. The third and last one i worked was awful. Manager abused her power. Constantly belittle her employees to the point were associates quit or demoted themselves. Upper management never did anything about it."
good,"This is a typical retail job. Let me stress that. Managers have favorites. There is lots of negativity. Never enough people to do the work.  Some managers are great to work for. Others not so much.If someone does not like you or wants you gone they can make your life very difficult. To the point that they will set you up and lie to get you demoted, moved, or even fired. Even for stuff you did not do. There is very little recourse when this happens.Coworkers can be a bright spot in an otherwise dreary day or they can be the bane of your existence. Depends on the store and the personalities. On the other hand there are great advancement opportunities. Good benefits overall. Tuition reinbursment program for certain majors. Stocks and 401k."
good,It is ok working at Publix supermarket not pleasure. I been working here also 7 years and it require a lot of working. It has the best customer service in grocery industry.
good,"Fun and friendly environment. A philanthropic attitude is a must when working at Publix supermarkets. While difficult to advance, unless you're willing to forfeit your personal life, the benefits when you achieve your advancement can certainly be worthwhile. It is a fast-paced environment with little room for error - especially when dealing with slicers - but the feeling of satisfaction you get when everything goes right is a feeling I won't soon forget. I really enjoyed working at Publix and it's definitely a great place to work. If they can fix minor issues such as possibly starting a ""managerial development program"" it would greatly benefit employees looking to make a career out of publix or at the very least give a greater option for advancement."
good,"I learned a lot about interpersonal skills in the work place, the hardest part of my job was all that i have turn learn, but very rewarding once I learned all these skills. The most enjoyable part of my job was working one on one with people, I love working in the Public and helping others out it is very rewarding to me."
good,Reviewing this company in 20 words or less. It is just that simple. I learned alot about this place and culture. Go enjoy the beach and less work.
good,"A typical day at work was fun, I got to cook different, simple meals. I got to meet lots of different people. The most enjoyable part of my day was meeting people. The culture in Publix was very wide spread. they hire all kinds of nationalities."
good,Its a great company and met a lot of great people while working there. Would of been a great job but the manager i was working under was a complete a hole.
good,Costumer service is a big deal in the job world. Costumers make a business and helping them out any way possible flourishes your business dramatically.
good,i personally don't like working there only because i don't think it's the right place for me. i don't like cashiering and i would like to see my other options considering i've only worked in two places
good,"Very busy department.  Always having something to do and deal with the customers first and foremost. "
good,My typical day at work is a real busy day. I've learned a lot and met a lot of people. The hardest day is when we are short staffed and we are super busy with customers
good,"Just a regular retail job, you make it the type of work environment you want, Good or bad. Best part of the Job is the bakery and lunch is always available."
good,"A typical day at work usually starts and ends the same but throughout can always be different. I start the day doing what the cleaning task is for two hours, then cashier and help train during the rest. Management is a hit or miss it depends who is working that day and if there in a good mood."
good,"It was ok, like any other supermarket. the environment was ok. "
good,"Too much drama people don't mind there business "
good,"Pleasant place to work.  Keep in mind that the company believes in conformity and you will be fine. There is not extra benefit for employees of any kind.  For example, 5% discount on grocery."
good,"fast passed very busy "
good,"This is a good place to get through college; they even pay for certain courses and majors. My managers were flexible with scheduling and understanding of academic commitments. But at the end of the day, it's still retail."
good,constant walking and standing all day. very short breaks. I think its unfair for cashiers to be standing all day at one spot . to be advanced in the company can be very hard at times.
good,"At first Publix seemed like a great place to work with the rules and guidelines they have in place. Due to how they schedule between busy season and slow season is like riding a roller coaster. Management doesn't always seem to treat employees fairly. They often make rude remarks to and about one another, sometimes damage equipment or merchandise because lack of care. Very hard to get on as full time and pay is lower than is desirable."
good,"Company was trying to be to many things low price leader, best meat in town, best produce in town. The company lost it identity."
good,CO-workers are amazing to work with. Environment is a wonderful place to be. How to treat everyone with respect. The most enjoyable part of public is interacting with customers.
good,My reviews on publix would be quite simple their a very good company with great benefits and they strive on keeping their buissness successful and customers happy.
good,"I loved this job starting out, however, the company has a decline in its performance due to it no longer being a family owned company. It seems that it is now a place with higher prices yet the same quality as any other grocery store."
good,Overall great company to work for in terms of benefits and long term advancement. Has it's ups and downs like any other workplace but coworkers and managers play a big part in the smoothness of how things are run.
good,I do not have to many complaints about publix.. its an okay workplace and thats just it its alright. management can be a bit iffy.
good,Somewhat stressful due to disgruntled officers.But if it weren't for these issues it is a great company to work for. the 401 k plan and stock program is definetly an incentive.
good,The store I worked at is different than others. The motto for every one should be good customer service between guests and management and employees. However it wasnt at the one I worked at.
good,"Publix started out as a great place to work, but if you have a family not so much. The portray that they are family friendly and for the most part id say that the are all for show for their customers, not their employees. I worked for them a long time, and the only thing I miss is the money I made each week and my stocks that I was given the opportunity to purchase."
good,Ive worked for the company twice trying to give them a benefit of a doubt cause i do enjoy my fellow co workers but managers and supervisors are not so understanding to your life outside of publix...and very rude and disrespectful to you..
good,"A typical day at New Horizon was fair, I learned that you have to deal with mental challenge adults one on one instead of in a group. Management was pretty fair in certain situations.Co-workers work together onsite. hardest part of the job restraining a consumer. Most fun part was connecting with mental challenge individuals."
good,It's a good company to work and many employees seem to like being there. The pay is still very low and there is no set schedule whatsoever.
good,Publix is a nice company to work for. Nice and caring people. Publix is big on safety rules. Don't really see anything negative about the work place..
good,"Overall the company is great. Some managers can misuse or abuse their role but for the most part, all managers and other employees  really want you to strive in the company and you end up working lie a family with a common goal rather than just another job. Every employee is usually customer friendly and it rubs off on you as you work. Their is always something to do and helping customers in any way is always a wonderful experience."
good,"great company in general but not the best to work for. Short breaks, unreliable schedule, not respected as an employee."
good,"My typical day is working from the afternoon until midnight and people treated and low level. I've definitely learned customer service skills and how to manage my emotions around bad management. I have good and bad co-workers like any job and the hardest part of the job is working under bad management, but I work through it.The most enjoyable part is getting paid and the option to buy stock"
good,Publix is a great company to work for but the job is not for everybody. I work in the deli so it fast pace soon as you walk through the door. Sometimes we can gets breaks and other times we just be so busy. All depending on your location.
good,"Overall, good company to work for if you are in the right location. The higher volume stores are run efficiently and provide you with the tools to be able to perform tasks well."
good,When I started there I really liked the company but now it is becoming very mechanical and disconnected from its customer base.
good,"a good company to work for i learned allot of things at this job a was able to expanded in different departments "
good,It was a good learning experience. Coworkers were easy to get along with. Team work and independent work were more or less equally valued.
good,Unorganized and none of the company’s guidelines are followed as they should be. The only positive is how involved the company is with the community.
good,"Publix is a really good place to work and would recommend it to many. Though at times can be tedious, and management not always organized the best."
good,"The manger ran the store really bad, not playing by the rules and such. So management was horrible, The job I got at Publix wasn't that awesome either stocking shelves for a living. Even though management wasn't the best, I have to say that the other co-workers were really good people and never had a problem with anyone."
good,"Entry level job.  Simple tasks that got boring over time. Enjoyed being challenged. Hardest part was again, co-workers."
good,"I love my position at Publix. Unfortunately, full time positions are hard to acquire.  The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customers."
good,you spend most of your time at the register bagging groceries whitch tends to be very tedious hardest part of the job is just staying motivated it tends to get very boring
good,"They pride themselves on customer service, which is nice. But all in all, it's just a job at this point. All the food is pre-made, which makes things easy, but coming from a kitchen job where we made everything fresh by hand, I do not really like it."
good,"As a bakery clerk, a typical day consists of packaging bread, taking care of customers' needs, and cleaning up at the end of the day."
good,"A typical day at work was good.I learned a big lesson in how to make the customer feel like family. Management was average, yet loving. You sometimes felt like a family. One of the hardest parts of the job was when a lackadaisical wave would seem to sweep over the store and you had to pick up for other peoples slack.The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customers happy.It would cause you to feel happy as well."
good,"It's a good place to work when you are in school, and it's good if you want to do management. Just not my lifestyle I want...it'll always be a part-time job for me. I'm there to help the customers and make sure they have a good experience. I love putting a smile on customers faces, and meeting new different people everyday. I just need something steady."
good,"the work place would help people to get better feeling and quicker relief, or when the management is not on it, then the pressure will be transferred to the whole working team"
good,"co workers are to work with "
good,"Overall a nice place to work. But half the associates don't really care about hard work, or customer service. There is a lot of unnecessary drama. And management has problems understanding associate needs and/or abilities, their needs come first."
good,"I learned a lot about the business of groceries and retail through my time at Publix."
good,"Meat clerks work in the meat department of grocery stores and butcher shops and are responsible for weighing, wrapping and pricing meat for customers. Depending on the store and responsibilities, meat clerks might be asked to slice deli meat or cut down larger pieces of meat for display at the meat counter."
good,"While working at Publix as a deli part time associate I learned the skills to provide high satisfactory customer service, phone etiquette, restock items, prepare food, work in a fast pace environment, work place."
good,Having to work them my co-workers was a good experince. We laugh all the time. The customers were great and I met alot of nice people.
good,"Publix is a great job overall, recommend for small part time and first time job, just avoid the deli if you want to move around from position to position"
good,Sometimes it felt like our management was bullying us around and making us feel so small in a company that it supposed to be welcoming and nice
good,A typical day at Publix is either tending to customer's needs and solving problems they may have or restocking merchandise. I learned valuable customer service lessons in how to deal with customers. Management was promoted within the company so career options were available. Co-workers ranged from high school students to retirees looking for extra money. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who could not be pleased. The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team with co-workers and friends and accomplishing the daily goals to keep the supermarket running.
good,"Publix will give you everything you could possibly want out of a job, except a decent paycheck. This makes it ideal for someone in high school or college, but a horrible choice for someone looking for a career, as it is all but impossible to secure decent wages, hours, or advancement."
good,The job was very worth coming to on a daily basis. I would come in clock in and go straight to work.. Not much people were friendly and the managers were very rude.
good,"everyone always talks about how great it is to work Publix and all the benefits it has. let me give it to you straight, unless you work 35+ hours a week continuously for a year you DO NOT receive any benefits. the schedule is also pretty flexible but only if you're on the good side of the person who makes the schedule because although they say that a automated computer does your scheduling for you its not. you also never have a definite schedule you have to constantly check online to make sure they didn't change anything without telling you. as one of your first jobs i recommend this place but as a permanent job, unless you're in management i don't recommend you stay. especially for 8.05 the hour."
good,"cutting meat and cheese,, making subs making sure customers are taken care of first and for most. making sure that all products are up to code"
good,"sweet co workers, ok management, fun place to work. felt welcomed but  some co workers weren't the friendliest to eachother."
good,"Okay short term job. Bad pay, management can go either way depending on store. In my experience. Admittedly, merchandising is horrible, all you do is take things from one spot and put it on a shelf."
good,Prepared pies for the customers. I learned how to used all different equipment in preparing the pies.  The management team was nice. My co-workers was the best.
good,good to work for steady work people were friendly i learned how to work for little money and follow orders    the hardest part of job was the lack of people skills
good,"Overall Publix is a good starting job. It has good benefits, and is a very stable job that treats the small employees well. The only downside is the pay is poor (because it’s a simple part-time job)."
good,Company was great to work for. I enjoyed going to work everyday and being able to work for a company that truly cared about its employees.
good,"Base on the day and times you come in, determine what you will be doing, even at management level. Opening Shift you came around 4am check temps of the store, and let people like bakery and grocery associates. deal with call outs and whatever comes up until the next MIC or Store Manager comes in. A mid shift you basic work as normal associate in roles unless you are MIC, or something managerial comes up. Closing Shift can be the same as a mid if a store manager is closing, but if not you are MIC, and you are in charge of the store, check on all departments, temps, and handle any customer issue and associate issues.all parts of the job. you be handling customer, associates, and paperwork depending on your department. I have worked in every department during my career at Publix. I have learned how to manage different type of individuals from many backgrounds. I have learned how to schedule using the oasis. I have leaned how to order, handle, and maintain inventory and supplies. I have learned how to do phonographs, reset stores, and get stores ready for reset teams. I have worked with many co-workers some bad, some good. all hard working people. Management depend on the managers and location. Publix management training is mostly self teach, or base on how good of a department manager you have. only corporate training is a one week academy that has some good information, but mainly focuses on Human Resource laws,and Diversity. The hardest part of the job, is the crazy hours and scheduling, other then that is like any other retail job. I started during college in 2004, I use to"
good,The most enjoyable part of my was was working with some great people and assisting customers. Keeping department clean and maintaining all stock to ensure customers always had what they needed.
good,Great place for advancement. If you are a hard worker than this will definitely be a great fit. Management is alright for the most part.
good,"Jobs are related to many traits. Jobs help provide stability, income, and personal lives to matter. It's an interesting cycle to ponder though."
good,I was hired on to be trained as a cashier. Throughout the 3 months I worked there I was never trained to be a cashier and instead worked as a front service clerk. My greatest take away from this job was the relationship I formed with my customers and fellow co-workers.
good,"I was a cashier at Publix and so my job was to check out the customers and ensure that their needs were met. When it wasn't busy, I would maintain the cleanliness of the store. Publix does have great benefits but the pay was about average."
good,"Always something to do. Never a dull moment. Helps with personal and career growth/development. Friendly managers and coworkers, always have store competitions, i.e. picnics, bowling tournaments, etc."
good,"Great place to work if you love being frustrated because last week you had 25 hours, and this week you have 7. Don't do it if you want any sort of consistency. Oh, and have fun bagging groceries for at least a couple of years before they decide you're worthy enough for something else."
good,They treat the full time people every well part time people not so much. Won't brake more than 25 hrs a week unless you go over on your own. Publix only cares about customers not there staff.
good,"good coworkers, management alright, everyone isn't treated fairly. I don't like the hours, get free lunch, breaks are okay."
good,"I left because I was graduating college. It's been over 10 years since and life hasn't been all that great. Should've stayed with Publix. They know what they are doing, there is plenty room for growth and good money to be made. Maybe I will just suck it up and go back."
good,It was a great place to work I probally still be employed if my wife wasn't a high risk pregnancy. I even applied for fmla and was denied.unfortunate but it was out of my control.
good,"	Greeted the customers politely and responded to their questions and requests in a courteous and helpful way."
good,"Typical day at work consists of clocking in, and going straight to the floor to assist customers with various needs."
good,"a typical day at work is hot and sweaty but with the co workers i have, the shift goes by quickly, the hardest part of the day is probably emptying the lugs full of product."
good,Publix in retail has it's ups and downs just like any other job. I've been working for this company for about seven years now. It's a great place to work if you make it a great place to work. Publix for the most part has terrific managers and associates who care much about the Publix mission statement.
good,"Fun place to work  co-workers,funny customers to be around an when you have been there for a while you will see them reg. I really do not have any thing bad to say about publix .Just ready to explore the world. Want more under my belt. Willing  to learn any thing new an fast learner."
good,"worked hard as a teen, shouldering the load of older people, who couldn't hold their own.Alot of long nights, closing and stocking the store alone when a lot of their people quit and continuously call out."
good,"A typical day at work would be doing grinds, weighing up chicken and helping customers. What I learned at Publix is you can learn anything if you put your mind to it."
good,Management is pretty terrible. I tried to become management material and they don't properly train to get there. Its not management that is terrible it is their lack of knowledge and compassion for their fellow workers.
good,"I have learned that all managers are not the same. Having worked at other stores, where I am currently at the ego rate is very high (manager wise). My co-workers are good people. The hardest part of my job is staying calm when management or customers get disrespectful. The only real benefit is the stock program."
good,Publix looks after their employees very well. They have very good benefits and make sure that you are alright. Good company to work for.
good,"I like that they care about their customer, they always come first. I've only worked there for a year so i didn't really make that much friends, but i liked the environment."
good,Long hours so there is no time for the family or yourself. Could be a good place for anyone coming out of high school. Other than that it's a start for anyone who looking for work.
good,Publix is a fun place to work you will start off in a part time postion but there are opportunities for advancement as well as stock options with the company that are only available to employees
good,"This was a really fast paced work environment, the mangers are cool but when its time to work they are two different peoples, deals with a lot of customers"
good,"I trained at a near by store and thought that this would be an amazing opportunity. The truth when I got to my store was different. I worked third shift at wal-mart and I never felt as taken advantage of as this. The co workers that I have are down right hateful. It's not unusual for me to be cussed at three times a day for simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Management isn't that bad, but when you work a 4am to 1pm, a 2pm to 11pm, and a 9pm to 6am all in the same week, you start to question how much your happiness as a person honestly matters. The benefits are actually great. good stock options, good health insurance, free health screenings, ect."
good,"Customer Service, handing product from metal department and seafood to customers. Unloading trucks for the store. A lot of people to deal with on a daily bases. Customers always coming in and out of the store constantly."
good,"A typical day at work included long hours and not enough pay. There is definitely job security there, but they do not treat their employees with any care. They expect you to work 6+ days a week, with little to no forewarning. 6+ days means 8-16 hours overtime, WHICH THEY MAKE YOU TAKE BACK! Meaning if you're scheduled M-F, 8 hours a day and they TELL you you must work Saturday as well, the following week whatever hours you worked on Saturday will be taken away. They will tell you to take a long lunch, or leave 1-2 hours early until you are back to 40-46 hours. More often than not, you are working a 6 day week, so I feel that is unfair. The most enjoyable part of my job was going to lunch because it was free."
good,It can become very slow pace and very cold. The staff wasnt as friendly. The schedule wasnt hand made it was made from an automatic computer system witch was not accurate with breaks though out the day. hours varied
good,depends on which store you work for. It can be a great experience. Raises are based upon work ethic. It will be a demand to work on holiday's if the store is open
good,On campus setting. Flexible hours and great food. Friendly coworkers and excellent way to explore your organizational skills. Clients are always satisfied
good,"Flexible hours, friendly co-workers and environment, beneficial for first time job, satisfactory work with customers in bagging groceries, enjoyed escorting customers to their vehicles upon request"
good,"Providing premier customer service is the goal of Publix."
good,"Its a productive environment. Work with others to provide premiere customer service. Learned many things such as time management, detail organization and more."
good,"I worked for them for 6 years, found that the more you are capable of, the more they use you for, without recognition, appreciation, or thanks."
good,Deli is ok same thing everyday service customers deal with them when there angry long hours a variety of different shifts ok management.
good,"I'd come in and check floats and birds to see what can be worked into the aisles. Management had its good days and bad days and usually didnt make much sense in when and how things were to be done, resulting in late nights and disgruntled employees. Got along with most co workers."
good,"Schedule varies every week open two days, close two days and one mid shift per week.  Required to work weekends and holidays."
good,Good company to work for with really good benefits. Work life balance is not very balanced however it all depends on where each individual's focus lays. For me it was my wife and son. I couldn't spend enough time with them while working 56-72 hours a week.
good,"*I learned how to handle stress and deal with other people's problems/questions throughout each day."
good,"The typical life of a bag boy was to come in, do your job and then head home when you were finished. There's opportunity for advancement, but only if that's what you want. I've seen many people come and go, but I've also seen many people continue to work the same position they've held for years."
good,"	Writing detailed Test Cases by referring to Business Requirement Document (BRD), High level design document (HLDD) and User Interface Specification."
good,"Did over night stock crew,  it was fun in college.  More of a workout since I have a good work ethic.  Working hard and fast moving heavy items and smaller items as fast as possible.  Mediocre pay, good benefits overall."
good,"At Publix i bagged groceries, carried out orders, stocked groceries and packages. All of my co-workers were friendly, working at publix i learned to be more of a social person."
good,I been working for publix for about three years and I have not got promoted yet to a cashier. I refuse to be a bag girl all my life.
good,A typical day at publix is to be nice and offer the best customer service. In the deli however you have to manage fast food as well while keeping up with the publix statis qou. Management is cluttered and a hassle. Co workers can be great and a pain. Pay is good but the work can be overwelming some times.
good,"The job duties I had at Publix were cleaning the bathrooms, backroom and store as a whole. On certain days when the new shipment came in I stayed overnight and placed new items where need be."
good,Publix is a great place to start entering into the working world and get an understanding of how the real world is in terms of customer/employee interaction.  Retail is not for everyone.
good,"Worked my way up in 2 separate departments, only took 6 years to achieve full-time status (was told after i turned 18 that they were gonna give me full-time) "
good,"working for this company is good. There are a lot of good benefits, you get bonus and you raises"
good,"At times, work seemed to not be as what I thought it would be, but overall, Publix is a great company to work for and very flexible with hours."
good,understanding how to compermise with coworkers an how interact with customers
good,Working for this company was an ok place to work but not really a first choice. Rudeness and non hospitable attitudes turned my view point of working for this company.
good,"Being a cashier for a supermarket is a good start up job for someone getting into the work force. Usually, a great place to start when you are in your teens."
good,"Publix has no concept of focusing on the REAL HARD WORKING  employees."
good,"Good clean place to work, fast pace, most enjoyable job I ever had, management was great"
good,Good place to work. I learned a lot working there. Great management.
good,Slow to respond to marketing needs in the marketplace and lots of barriers to getting tasks completed.
good,"good to work for if making Publix a career, not flexible for school"
good,i was a cashier so i always had guests coming through my line with their groceries.
good,working at for publix is great but the mangers need to be more trained and respectful
good,"While working at Publix, I learned to work with and serve multiple kinds of people. I learned to cooperate with my coworkers and the many challenges of the retail industry."
good,"During my time here I was diagnosed with a health condition which interfered with my work. Instead of working with me to help still give me hours which I was able to work due to this health condition, they fired me. I loved working here until these turn of events in which I would not recommend working at the location I did due to the management staff."
good,"While this job wasn't as stimulating as I was searching for, it was a good, safe position in a company that values their employees and their customers."
good,"best company i ever worked for. wish i didnt quit, but oh well. the benefit are better than every other company."
good,I help and take care of customers. I make sure customer has every thing they need or want.
good,ok busy work environment with several duties to perform with each customer.  Enjoyed spending times with some of my coworkers
good,My first Job was assisting the bakers and Dealing with all of the customers.
good,"cheap pay, on your feet all day with short breaks, hard to get full time"
good,"Learned to give premier customer service, several cash handling standards and health department standards."
good,Awesome co-workers and a fun environment to work in. Management wasn't the best.
good,The day usually began with showing up in full uniform and immediately going to the Deli and servicing customers.  The deli sold sliced meats and cheeses and cooked meats including rotisserie and pieces of chicken.  Coworkers are friendly and willing to help with any issue.  I learned how to clean and operate a meat slicer.
good,"Assist customers	"
good,need to treat employers better. no room to move up in this company.
good,Publix was a great company to work for as an associate. As soon as I got promoted to manager of the meat department my quality of life took a downward spiral. I worked my way from a bagger to a manager over my eight years with publix. As a manager they paid based on a fluctuating work week. Basically I was being paid for 40 hours but I was working 65+ hours per week. Publix taught me so much about retail and serving customers like royalty. I loved satisfying customers daily but after many 18 hour days i had to move on.
good,Management is ok. Great place to work. Great opportunity to grow with company
good,the most enjoyable part of the job would be when a customer calls you by your name and feels comfortable with you because you gave them great customer service.
good,"My job involves putting in an order, doing an morning inventory, setting up the seafood case. Keeping my seafood and frozen cases blocked and full. Keeping everything clean and sanitized. Unloading deliveries. Helping customers to find an item, give information on an item and package an item for them."
good,Must be able to act quick and maintain a normality to your work effort. Assist fellow co workers as the day moves forward.
good,I liked working at Publix. My only advice is to not rock the boat. Have excellent customer service skills and you'll go far. I had a lot of fun with my co workers and am still friends with all of them.
good,"Great company, work schedule is flexible. Only thing worth noting is that the store doesn't pay you what you're worth but that depends on what store you worked at."
good,I had to clear the parking lot full of buggys and made sure i give the best customer service to our customers
good,"as part time, we do not receive benefits not set hours. In my department, seafood, my hours are set at only 2 days a week. Can purchase health and dental only. Pay is terrible, with maximum of a quarter an hour per 6 month review. If you switch departments, pay can decrease since each department sets their own wage levels."
good,"I liked working with Publix. Most of the management was fare to all the employees, some however not so fare. My co-workers were easy to work with. The hardest part of this job was the long hours they required. The most enjoyable part was the overtime pay from those long hours."
good,"Learned how to interact with people "
good,"no opportunities, expected hard work, no over time, but the pay came every week but despite that they treated the employees very well"
good,I enjoyed learning and the training of my technicians and monitoring inventory.   However the company has recently gone under new management which has affected this well known company adversely
good,"Was my very first mechanic job learned a lot.  Hydraulics' , electrical and welding."
good,fun place to work and huge focus on department cleanliness.
good,"Fast paced and very structured"
good,more involved with employees and better pay for the working man would keep people.
good,Enjoyed most of the co-workers and customers at work and also the training to improve your performance.
good,Decided to resign from Publix due to the flexibility issues when I transferred to a new store.
good,"Clerical, filing & Quality Assurance"
good,"Its horrible. I worked there with very little room for expanision. I was working on a project that required AD configurations, which I have over 9 years experince in; I added the correct parameters -- everything worked except my manager having a fit that I edited AD. Gheeez!"
good,I liked the job for the most part. Although there were no real benefits to working at the company other than just for the paycheck. They are a very nice company and I still enjoy shopping there.
good,To be honest I don't really remember much about working at Publix.
good,better customer service     lerning produce       helping customer great coworker good management lunch time helping customer
good,Going back to school to be come a medical assistant and x-ray tech
good,My job consisted of filling in alot of areas of the warehouse when we were short handed.This consisted of performing different task each day.
good,Really loved working there. the atmosphere was great and i was actually happy to go to work each day
good,"I've worked with the company for several months now, and I can say this is a good company. However many lead me to believe that this was one of the best companies to work for in the area, and I can say that I have worked with better. "
good,Good place to work    had a child while working there and couldn't stay on the 3rd shift-- I even offered to go to fuel island and take a pay cut   they didn't work with me
good,Not having correct information to perform your job.  Working with the hearing impaired was quite challenging
good,I've learned how to provide excellent customer service and how to manage money and cash transactions.
good,"a great good while you are in high school to earn money."
good,I worked as a bag boy for publix. The easiest job you can work with very little pay. It's a good first job for a highschool student but you can also make a good careeer out of publix.
good,"I was a cashier so I scanned things  3000x a day"
good,i enjoy working with the public and interacting with different ethic diversity.
good,"You cannot work off the clock, so work begins the when you do clock in. That means keeping the area clean, all service area have supplies as needed, roasting chicken as needed, taking over from someone who needs to leave. That employee can not work overtime. Training new employee that are young with no work ethics. So I learned to work under pressure. No back-up from management and co-workers. Working with young workers, who do not really want to work and show up. The benefits"
good,"I learned how to  effectively reprimand associates and how to train and develop new associates."
good,Generally the company was good to me for 29 years.  Through that time I have had the priviledge of working with and being mentored by very good individuals.
good,"Being in the meat department for so long, I am used to cold temperatures as well as the craft of cutting meat. Nice cut of meat made me happy knowing I put the work towards presenting the product to the best of my ability the costumer."
good,"publix is ideal for students because of the flexible hours but it sucks to work there when you have cheap, two-faced managers. i found it very annoying to have to be forced to sell all the donation stuff the offer especially when you see the same customers almost every day and your hours would be cut for no reason. the only thing i liked about working there was that i wasn't on the register, i would always be fixing the shelves or doing go backs"
good,"I enjoyed fellow workers and very much enjoyed my customers. There was  opportunity if you chose to take it."
good,"Picked orders, shrink wrap and stage for shipping. Operated come along forklift and finished in a timely manner. "
good,learn customer services and customer appreciations good learning experience just didnt get along with the store manger but like the people i worked with
good,"A typical day at work was check in, count cash, open a register, help with customer service, ring people up at the register, close out register, count money and then sign out. I learned how be a better person with social interaction and learned that the customer always comes first. My management and co-workers were wondreful. They all worked as a team and always had eachothers backs. They were very helpful and would take he time out of their schedule to help any way they could. The hardest part of the job was remembering all the fruit and vegetable codes. The most enjoyable part was the social interaction and being able to help people."
good,"Publix is a strong company with solid benefits.  It generally promotes from within, which is generally a good thing.  However, this sometimes leads to promotions based on length of service rather than merit."
good,You Learn about different Managers and People. A typical day is fun and your always on your feet. Its definitely a Family in the Bakery. I learned how to decorate cakes. Management is not too good I feel I am being underpaid and my title is the same when it should be a decorator. 
good,Stocking and blocking the grocery shelves. Greeting and assisting customers.
good,"unloading trucks early morning,stocking shelves before customers arrive"
good,The job depends on where you are and who is managing the store. If the store is in a large populated area then the job will be fast paced. The managers believe that you should be moving at all times even when it is slow. A worker in a slow store will find themselves dusting off balloons and repetitively cleaning the same sopt to keep from getting yelled at by management
good,I enjoyed going to work as I really liked my fellow associates & we all got along well. We taught each other new thing as we learned or trained new accociates when they came in.
good,"I have been with Publix for over two years, it is a great place to work, there are advancement opportunities, however it is hard as a single parent to achieve those advancements. Otherwise this is a family friendly company that has values and appreciates their employees."
good,I learned about how Publix Is such a successful company. They promote from within the organization to well deserving employees. I learned about the logistics that it takes for the stock trucks to arrive in time to get the product to the customer in a timely manner. The co-workers were great most were very easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was probably the extremely unconventional hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was the things I learned about how Publix is ran.
good,"Started there as a cashier and moved to deli, loved working there, lots of fun, the customers are the one's that you want to come to work every day. took orders, made platters, sliced meat and cheese, helped customers with there needs, worked my way up to asst. deli manager. did P&L helped with orders to make sure department running effectively, with right supplies."
good,The customers are usually what makes the day pretty good. The management are not on the same page which makes it confusing for us working under them what exactly they expect of us.
good,A typical day at Publix was checking in with management and heading to your register. Greeting customers and processing their orders.
good,"Typical day at work is making sure customers are finding what they need, keeping a sanitary work enviroment, and getting along with managment and other associates."
good,"The majority of the work consisted of waiting on & serving customers, packaging & pricing products & cleaning assignments."
good,"I started at Publix when I was 14 years old, and stayed there throughout high school. It was a great job for a young person. I made a lot of friends, I got my feet wet in the world of working, I learned to handle money and gained great customer service skills."
good,They will take advantage of you and work you like a dog if they want to. I do still love everything from publix.
good,The refrigeration department was very supportive to get new employees up to speed
good,Working at Publix has showed me great customer service skills I can deal with any type of customer in any scenerio. I learn to be very patience and how to multi-task differnet type of jobs. There is no hard part in my job because I love to learn new things so I take it as knowledge.I get to meet new people everyday so that's the most enjoyable part.I just don't like the fact that I been part-time for Five years no advancement or even an offer to advance.
good,Employed as a part time cashier. Great company to work for. I loved my job and enjoyed working with people.
good,must be able to handle working flexible hours. Not set. you get long breaks but not paid breaks.
good,Being a bakery clerk consists of helping customers and getting all the daily bread and pack out on the shelves. Work environment is mostly easy going. My duties aren't very difficult at all. There's not a good chance of moving up in positions which is why I am looking for something different.
good,I enjoyed the job I just got very sick six months after I got there.
good,Analyzed profit and loss statements from the previous week and forecast production to meet department goals.
good,Analyzed profit and loss statements from the previous week and forecast production to meet department goals.
good,The employees that started before 2010 changes have it made at Publix. At Orientation our class was told old policies. Sunday $1.00 more per hour ~ not true. I was not happy about that at all.
good,The start of my day would include the checking the forklift I would be using throughout the day. Then I would check the dock and doors for any debris or damage. Once the freight began to arrive I would begin unloading and staging it on the dock for receiving to start on. When the shipping product was ready I began to load and seal the trucks. The management and co-workers were generally very helpful and friendly.
good,"Pack the purchase before handing to customer, total customers' purchases and accept payments. Verify customers' identity for payments made through checks and credit cards. Count amount of money at the beginning of each shift."
good,You can get a lot ofhelp with staff froma all different depatments and gain a bit of experience of what a franchise company is capable of doing.
good,"I learned a lot of customer service skills from working at Publix but I was not a big fan of management. The only reason I enjoyed working at Publix were the customers and co-workers. I worked my hardest everyday to meet the managers expectations, never went over or under on money count, always did my job before I was told and always volunteered to do extra work."
good,"starts with setting up my tools,I''v learn that being a cake decorator has so many different area, and making different decorations is exciting. if workers complained they were either given pink slips or suspended, or fired.Co workers are very intiminated by department managers/suprevisors, they are afraid to speak when witnessing something wrong out of fear, they may lose their job.The hardest part of the job, making orders for deadline, the bakery is a very fast paste area, staying ahead on orders and chores is important.The happiest time for me, was leaving to go home,,Knowing I made that cake ,did my best seeing the customer very satisfied,thats pleasure with a smile."
good,I had a great experience working at Publix but unfortunately I had to leave because I had to take of my mom wish was really sick in Georgia.
good,Too many personalities and favorites. And the workload wasnt evenly distributed among the crew.
good,"Publix is a good place to work , the pay is good and so are the benefits"
good,"Part time associates got roughly 15 to 20 hours a week. I managed to get only 10 to 15 hours a week. Good place to work if you are full time but they limit the amount of full time employees they have. With child support taking my checks, $9.50 per hour didn't give me enough money for me to survive with the hours I was given."
good,Publix Super Markets is a great place to work and gain general work experience knowledge.
good,"Publix is a great opportunity to work while going to school. The management is not always favorable, but the policies are well thought out. It is very simple to do your job, and work with happy individuals. Scheduling is an easy task around classes, and there is almost always an opportunity to pick up extra shifts. It's even possible to work in other locations to cover other individuals' shifts. It takes an extremely steadfast and lucky stroke to move up in the company, and include a pay increase with that move. Otherwise, though, it's a pretty great place to work steadily, and enjoy some of the most interesting people who work there."
good,"advancement is great a raiseevery 6 months you are able to be a part of shares after a year , nice community ,fast paced some publix have cart boys which recieve tips others dont"
good,"NIce to work, able to move up rather quickly depending on the department that you are in. Pay a lil low to start off with but increase come rather often."
good,"We would unload a new produce semi every morning at 3 am. Then we would stock all of the new produce, while throwing away or donating bad produce. Had a lot of customer interaction, I've met and worked with every type of person imaginable. That's what happens when you work for a company that sells food. I've learned a lot from working for Publix and it's been a good Company to me, I just don't want to stock produce for the rest of my life. Management there does pretty much what the full time employees do. They just get paid more and don't mind doing that for the rest of their life. I simply don't."
good,Some of the company leaders continue to follow the founders core values which are great. The culture is changing and these values are taking a backseat.
good,Publix is a good place to work as well as shop. for the little while i worked there i never had any problems. management tries their best to work with your school schedule if you are a student. there is plenty of room for advancement at this company.
good,"Was an ok place to work, but was and still is lacking good productive workers and managers"
good,"Been with the company for three years really really enjoyed my first store in Live Oak, it was smaller and more associate friendly. The store I currently work at in Lake City is ok but could use improvement when it comes to dealing with associates as people not just employees. Overall it's a good part time job."
good,This was an okay place to work; I actually enjoyed it here. If I hadn't found myself coming home nauseous from all of the smells I probably would've lasted here a lot longer. Lots of encouragement from upper management and coworkers about what you can do to improve your skills and make the shopping experience a much better one for the customers!
good,This company is good to work with but advancement is slow and takes entirely too long. I’ve been working here for three years and still get put on the back burner for advancement opportunities! Finding a new job as soon as I can with better pay.
good,"A job if you're a teenager. Takes too long to get promoted to a higher position or different department. Each store varies. Some stores approve time off right away, some don't at all, depends on the people working at the store. Some managers and coworkers are great some are not."
good,"Each store has about six departments; grocery, produce, bakery, deli, meat and customer service. All relatively easy. Just find where you fit in and exceed and you can definitely move up in the company if you wish. Some in as little as  6 months."
good,"Brutal work environment, customers don’t understand the concept of the word no. always trying to scam us, but overall the staff is very friendly and always are trying to help you learn new skills"
good,"I have been with Publix for 9.5 years. Started as an hourly associate, got promoted to management within 3 yrs. And I applaud the company for their support in the early stages of my employment. Over the more recent years the original members and VP's have retired, died, etc... The people who replaced them are not so supportive of associates, they are more about greed now. The open door policy close and the culture has phased out. It's not the same"
good,Publix is a great company but the store I work at has some managers who do not respect the associates or care to help you in personal situations. Other than that I Truly enjoyed working there
good,It was very nice making connections with different customers from all over the world. Listening to their stories and building a bond with the regulars.
good,"Publix presents as a company that cares about employees and customers. In the end what they have created is a culture and expectation that only works toward profit and an entitled, demanding customer base that leaves employees constantly frustrated or resentful. As a deli employee I was treated so badly by customers at times that I would have needed $100,000 a year to justify why I stayed there. Spending five dollars on deli meat seemed to be enough to make customers feel like I was a slave rather another human being. If they perceived service was too slow there were eye rolls and loud talking about incompetence or a stomp over to the customer service desk. After management apologized profusely to the customer for whatever perceived injustice they had suffered they would usually turn to us and roll their eyes and say, 'Don't worry about it."" Training at first seems to be great, but you will soon find out that learning there is just throwing you in the arena and hoping you learn fast. Seeing as you are feeding hundreds of people and could potentially give them food poisoning you would think that the training would be a little more extensive than a once over explanation and word of mouth. Very few employees do anything the same way which is shocking in a corporation that size. If I heard, ""But, I do it this way..."" once, I heard it a hundred times. Upper management(above store level) seemed more focused on making sure the tea cooler and the grab and go coolers were filled than having enough employees to serve the customers right in our face. Not once while I was there did the"
good,Good place to work. Met great people. Hardest part was when i was kinda lost and i usually had good days when i was on task working hard to earn money for my self.
good,"An everyday would consist of friendly greets once you enter, you clock in every one greets you and of course you greet them back and start your day. you would a thing or two everyday from customers because they come from far and wide at my store"
good,As long as you are a friendly and are willing to learn new things . Although it can get very hectic during rush hour especially in the deli it pays off.
good,"Publix is an okay place to work. There really wasn't any stress but the pay is horrible. They do not even offer discounts for products or food. There is no overtime, or benefits for part-time employees. There really is no stress either."
good,"Typical days of work for most stockroom employees are coming in between 3-5pm till around 2-4am. I've learned quite a few things since I've worked here like how to correctly stock shelves, block and maintain the sales floor, and how to do inventory for a grocery store. The hardest part of the job has to be making sure to do everything the store manager has us do, which for stockroom workers seems to be more than most. I really have to say that the most enjoyable part of my job there is working around my fellow associates and interacting with the customers, they are always happy to see us."
good,"Customer service is where all the disgruntled customers end up. People that have problems with their bills, want to return damaged items or have stolen items and attempt to return them without receipts. Other people try to cash out with their food items and get mad if you are busy with money orders, lottery or western unions. It is a mad house at the first of the month, everyone wants to pay their bills, cash payroll checks or get money orders."
good,I've been there a while now and it's not the best company to work for. You get jipped in your hours A LOT. Pay sucks. Hours suck. Manager not communicable through out the shift. It's only busy during lunch and dinner. Customers are rude as heck.
good,manager are good.its not a bad place to work as a manager.If your not a manager. you dont get much money and you cant live.working paycheck to check..
good,It made my depression worse. Don't work here if you are lazy. xoxoxoxoxooxoxxoxoxoxoxooxoxoxoxxooxcocoococxxooxoxoxoxocococococococococoococcococcoooc
good,"It's hard to describe a typical day as a manager at Publix because it is all over the place and depends on what is going on. I worked for Publix for almost 16 years and would never bash a company that I still have stock in however, the time I was employed there I did not have a work/life balance. The pay is fantastic and the benefits are even better and there's always room for improvement because every company has room for improvement."
good,"Pros;The company is good giving a great benefits to its employee. "
good,Its ok place to work. It worked for the time but it's time to move onto something more permanent. Great customers and management could be better. Looking for more stable hours.
good,"Great management,Free stock after 1000 hrs of work. No paid holidays or vacation for part time expect to work weekends.You do get Christmas, Thanksgiving and Easter closed for the Holidays."
good,"Clean area, stock shelves, check for out of date product, check vendor product into the system, record on hand of products, and process damages. Helping customers find products."
good,"It was a typical day at work because its a lot of stocking items and specials too. I learned about stocking cuz its easy and fast for me to stock items. The management was good because I learned from them and can do everything I want. The workplace culture is okay because customers can shop everywhere and what they want. The hardest part of the job is rotating products in dairy, scanning out damages and out of dates and doing counts every day. The most enjoyable part of the job is stocking products and helping the associates."
good,Great place to work with great associates. You are expected to accomplish goals and are given some support. Customer service is very important and is one the highest priorites.
good,"Very fast pace depending on location "
good,It was an ok job for starting out. I wouldn't want to work there forever. The management was not the best but it wasn't the worst I have ever had either.
good,If you’re a student then it’s a great job. but if you’re out trying to make a living then don’t waste your time. the employees are great there and super nice but the hours are pretty much nonexistent. one week i was only scheduled for 7 hours. FOR A WEEK. it would probably be a good side job or something to that nature. i realize is a company you have to grow with but they can’t honestly think you can make any kind of living with the amount of hours they give.
good,Publix trains they're managers well. I have learned how to manage a team and develop individuals for advancement. I have grown personally and professionally by continuous mentoring by my managers.
good,"Great place if you need part time and do not want to advance to full time. Hours are flexible.Management is friendly. Pay raises are too subjective and minimal. Overall I enjoy working for this company. Part time benefits are within the norm,or better."
good,"Some things are a little strange at this job, you can be told you cant leave at your scheduled time, whether its lunch time, or time to go home, sometimes scheduled an 8h shift with only 30m lunch."
good,"This is great to work at if you are still in school and need a job while you finish. If you want to make it a career make sure you can handle politics, favoritism different personalities and work ethics."
good,"Best place for retail pharmacists, most tech hours of chains, no drive through to deal with, difficult/no recourse for technician call outs, extremely difficult to use vacation time"
good,"I think Publix is great if you are a teen or retired and looking for a little    additional income. But to work full time is extremely hard on the body  and the hours are extreme. I think in management, it takes a toll on the family. You must work a designated number of hours per year in able to receive some of the benefits."
good,"Publix started out as a great place to work. But the management slowly got worse, and they didn't care about their workers as much. They would often play favorites and treat others worse."
good,"A typical day in the deli consisted of making sandwiches, cutting meats(using a slicer), and taking orders via phone calls. The customer amounts vary depending on the time of day. There is almost always a lunch rush in which the customer amount may triple or more. The staff is good but the job requires a lot of focus. You have to be trained on how to use slicers, fry food, and make sandwiches. If you have a hard time dealing with a large influx of customers, I would not recommend this job for you."
good,It has been great working for this company and I am looking forward to working for this company ........................................... ..........
good,"It was fine.. need more money/hours... if you can’t work the hours due to life.. they will cut your hours just so they can be happy I guess.. overall it’s okay, it was better when I first started"
good,"A typical day would be walking in a department with a lot of bread ready to be sliced, answering calls, cleaning constantly, taking care of customers at the register. and putting frozen boxes away at night."
good,I like working and can work with anyone at anytime like having fun and relax but still work at a nice pasta and talk to each other and make a team work
good,When I first started working for the company I didn't imagine I would be there for almost 13 years but I enjoyed my job thanks to some pretty decent managers that made me feel like family ..
good,"It's not the worst place to start working, but if you need a real job to pay the bills I suggest somewhere else, or at least full time with anything but a customer service position. When I started, the management was amazing, but little by little they were getting switched out with more inexperienced people who were really rude. Publix prefers a more ""intrusive"" and ""strict"" person as a manager nowadays"
good,"Work-life balance is very difficult for management. You have little family time, and it’s not a priority for upper management to facilitate. They talk about it but they don’t live up to it."
good,"Get paid well for management positions.  However due to being salary, it is very hard with young kids.  They want you to work MANY hours.  If you have a family emergency, it is frowned upon."
good,"I enjoyed the coworkers for the most part, however management was very difficult. They would say they would do something to help you advance, and never do it. They also had high expectations that their workers be in constant motion, even when there wasn't much work to do. If you are bagging you are constantly getting carts in the hot Florida sun. They also didn't inform me when I was hired how frequently I would be cleaning. I would have never taken a job as a janitor, so I found this quite underhanded. They claim cleaning is everyone's job and is a part of owning, but yet only a select few a chosen over and over to do this task. Advancing or switching departments in this company is virtually impossible. They chose favorites, and everyone else is treated poorly. Management frequently cuts hours when an employee isn't their favorite, or for petty reasons like asking for a day off. They don't value employees that have been their working hard, and when they decide to do a hiring spree everyone's hours get cut."
good,Publix does not like to give full time and the hours are hard if you have a family pay is also low Great for someone in high school or college but its difficult to make a career here if you are not in management
good,"can learn a skill to advance career, slow advancement , start at part time, raises are in slow increments to survive or make a living of it.  but advancement is all up to the individual person."
good,They don’t allow tips but there’s some customers who still give their employees tips specially their baggers because some of them realize they work hard.
good,Not much I remember about working there. I do remember that work there most of the time was quick & you had to be on it. you was able to meet new people everyday and create friendships with customers and co workers.
good,2 days is not enough work. I have had several managers and this has led to the inconsistent work schedule.  I have made myself available for them to call me in and this has been a help to my schedule.
good,The management was terrible. The staff is full of gossip and the different departments act like rival gangs instead of coworkers. The hours are extremely inconsistent.
good,"Retail isn't for everyone. You will have to work with people as well as for people you may, or may not like. I enjoy the people the people I can work with, but there are those that make my job more difficult."
good,I enjoyed working there mainly because I learned how to interact more with the public and how to keep cool in certain situations. The managers were good at their jobs and worked with you.
good,"The benefits there is really great. You get discount on a lot of things. Movies ticket, cars parts, concert tickets, football, basketball, soccer, and hockey tickets. Their health insurance is one of the best and most affordable out there. So over all everything is awesome there. Benefits wise."
good,The culture and employees are wonderful but management and the customer base is deplorable. It is a good job to have while you are in school or can only work a few hours.
good,"A typical day is filled with a variety of duties depending on which department you work in, front service is customer focused, grocery is stocking and blocking, specialized departments duties vary, hours can sometimes be erratic and management can be difficult at times"
good,Not much to really say the company has slowly changed over the years for better or for worse. It is not as family oriented as it use to be at least for me.
good,"For the people who enter publix the minimum paycheck one receives for 40 hours is about 325 after taxes.That equates to about $16,900 a year at most and in Orlando, Florida  that's not enough to live off of. The average rent is $1351 which is more than I made in a month, The health benefits subtract $100 from the weekly check thus making it nearly impossible to survive on. The rate in which a promotion may come around for a given store is around once every 2 years. Since promotions are so rare for those not in management it forces employees to scrape by some other means."
good,It can be very stressful working at Publix. I've learned a lot on how to interact with people and how to solve problems in a productive way. Publix managers have been helpful when i need a helping hand.
good,I didn't really enjoy working there because management was neglectful towards the employees. I was injured on the job and never really got my workers comp to the full which upset me.
good,Stores are ran based on Store managers. Great managers making working there fun. Awful managers make it miserable. They point out everything wrong and never compliment the right
good,Super flexible when I was going to school. Management and coworkers were friendly and helpful if you had a lot of work. Customers were pleasant to deal with.
good,I worked at Publix while going to school.  they were very flexible with my class schedule and gave me plenty of hours and training opportunities.  You can move around to different departments if you want to.
good,They mostly make you start at the bagger or cashier. You really don’t get promoted. You mostly ask to do the job you want to do and you get it. That it really. I really enjoy working there. And I make 10.65 a hour for 3 years. You do get a party every 5 years. And you make a lot of good friends too. Working at Publix is really fun at it time. But when you are new they do like to make you clean a lot.
good,management picks and chooses those they want to advance doent matter how much u bust ur butt management for the most part are cool untill they get in trouble then they blame use most
good,"Publix is better than some other places to work, but it's still like any typical corporation. Their top priority is making as much money as possible. The managers will do anything to keep customers coming back, no matter how toxic the customer may be and no matter the expense of the rest of our dignity. Advancing through the ranks isn't always achieved through hard work, but rather who you know and who likes you. Because of that, the people who have successfully made it to management positions are not always the most qualified or deserving of such a position. At a corporate level, Publix is just as shady as any corporation. They do little things to mislead and trick customers with convoluted sale signs, false claims in our mission statement, and intentional omission or misdirection on certain things. With all that said, working at Publix can still be enjoyable. My co-workers are all great and a couple managers are too."
good,I dislike that customers return items knowing that they stole the items. I think the return policy needs to be changed so that returned items be reduced.
good,Great job for a young adult or a senior but does not pay well enough to provide housing and comfortable living financially. More customer service than I would prefer and not as much labor as I would.
good,Publix has great benefits and competitive pay but publix is your life.  It is very difficult to find a balance between home and work life. They care as much as they can without sacraficing money. I used to really love my job until I went into management. This is a great job for any individual that doesnt need a balance or someone without a degree that can make a lot of money with the right attitude.
good,"As a full timer don't expect to have a good balance of family life and work unless your manager is willing to put in extra effort into scheduling. Inconstant interpretation of policies from store to store for the associate level. "
good,"Publix was a great place I started working at when I was 16. But now it's hard to balance life and work if publix isn't your life. The job helped me become more outgoing and friendly to strangers and find it easier to strike up a conversation to making friends. I liked helping the newer employees because I knew they meant well and I was in their shoes when I started and no one was helping me, so it's nice for a change."
good,Great company just not enough room to grow here in Columbia. Been a little stagnant for the past 3 years. Ready to experience something different with better schedules
good,"It's been okay working at Publix, although I feel that positions are paid little compared to the amount of labor they do. Days usually go by slowly and it's really taxing on the feet, the voice, and the arms, but an abundance of friendly co workers helps drown that out. The workplace can be very monotonous at times as you are doing the same thing over and over again with the flow of people being the only mediation between working hard or hardly working. The hardest part of the job is the hours. If I'm lucky I'll have 10 hours a week despite being available all week. The most enjoyable part of the job is the values it teaches you about working."
good,"not much more to say than its a deli, long hours on your feet, i would get thrown in to make chicken when I had no formal training on how to do it, they did do a lot of training classes monthly and the only good thing about it is the long term benefits."
good,"Publix used to be a great place to work, with the new changes I can no longer recommend that you pursue a career at Publix. You get no benefits compared to other places of work anymore, raises are cents when they used to be dollars, the health insurance is pitiful, management will demand the most of you yet not do anything themselves, hours can be cut at will for no reason, bad employees get let off the hook constantly but when you mess up after working an 80 hour week you'll be hung. good if you have no other option"
good,I was able to transfer to different location within the company while in college as needed. I was able to try different positions throughout the stores as well.
good,"Although the pay is good and you're eligible for a raise every 6 months, cashiering makes you feel like a robot. You stand in one position for a 8 hour shift constantly scanning and bagging groceries."
good,"There is work/life balance for upper level management but not lower level management.  Promotions are no longer based on work ethic, ability or tenure.  Company is highly demanding of department managers requiring them to work up to 7 days a week and 60 plus hours.  Even though they pay more than others in the same industry for management, the starting pay for hourly associates is still lower than others.  Managers are criticized and and rarely praised."
good,Publix is a good place to work. No set schedules. Good benefits. Management is mostly good. Good customer base depending on the store you work at. Job security.
good,"Overall the company is a kind, loving community and we really celebrated our successes. They are goal oriented to keep the company strong and are open to any opinions and ideas. It is easy to connect and make friends with the co-workers too."
good,"Very busy fast paced work placed standing for entire shift , part timers do not get benefits. Employee will see benefits long term. Customers are always right."
good,"While the benefits are great for a grocery store the low quality overall management policies and stress is rough. Often shifts are inconsistent and demanding, and they do their best to save on hours per department so there are frequent times where departments are understaffed and when people call out they are not replaced."
good,"Picked this job up as a first job to bring in some income while studying. It served me well starting as a bagger, then becoming a cashier / shelf stacker. The company is keen on internal promotions, if you want to grow with the company, you can."
good,Publix management and hr rules do not take care of all employee's I went from getting 35 and up hrs a week in grocery to transferring to the meat department and getting less than 20 a week
good,The management at a couple of the stores I worked at were horrible. Hours were great if you were a hard worker. I would recommend it for a part time job but not for a long term career.
good,"Your job title lets you know what your job task are for the day, i've learned how grocery retail works from the inside out. I would like management to be more supportive to their team members future goals within the company, and assist; if they can to obtain it. The work place depends on what type of people you work with. Like any other work place, there is no hard part to the job; either you want to be there, or you don't. You can do the job or you can't. The most enjoyable part of the job is making long term relationships with great, like minded co-workers and pleasant customers that value the work you do for them."
good,I'd come into work and level the store for 6 hours till the delivery truck came and then we unloaded that and went back to leveling . also helped customers all day
good,"Publix is very inviting, associates make you feel welcome, the atmosphere is great. Management is very flexible with schedules. Once you start working, you realize how many people stick around in the company for a very long time. As part-timers you do get some good benefits that a lot of other places only offer to their full-time employees."
good,"The workplace culture is enjoyable and a typical workday focuses on providing premiere customer service to our consumers. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a pleasant attitude when dealing with angry or unhappy customers. Management is generally flexible and understanding. Hardest part of the job is adapting to new managers, as managers usually relocate after two or three years. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with other customer service associates because we are a team."
good,"People speak highly about Publix but, it surely does not meet the standard you'd be expecting. If employees had a say on how things were done and handled, there would definitely be a lot of changes."
good,My location is in a high class part of town. You have to deal with rich snooty people who are use to getting their way when they are wrong. If you do not have open availability you do not get over 20 hours.
good,I started working at Publix when i was 16 in high school as a bagger/ front service clerk. While there I stood out among the other employees and was taught nightly cleaning duties as well as register use.
good,work you more days than days you have off. not a good balance. work long hours days back to back with little sleep in between shifts. if mangers get mad at you they will not give you a lot hours.
good,"If you are willing to put the time, blood, sweat and tears into it, Publix is a wonderful company to grow with. There can be a lot of drama as one may try to move up the corporate latter- that being said, keep your friends close and your enemies closer...."
good,"Good job until I started getting older then they started making remarks like ""aren't you getting ready to retire soon. They want to drive out the old to make room for the young."
good,"A typical day at work was very fast paced and customer service oriented. My responsibilities included prepping various food items for the day, such as salads, sandwiches, and both fried and rotisserie chicken. The roles in the Publix deli were very clearly defined and everyone worked together as a team to achieve the daily requirements."
good,"No point working for Publix unless you are full time. Part time pay and benefits are low. Great for young adults trying to gain work experience. Flexible work hours. Pay is above minimum wage and based on previous work experience. Career advancement is possible, but very difficult."
good,Publix is a great place to work for those who want a flexible schedule and challenging work environment. Publix is genuinely invested in its associates development and furthering their careers.
good,"a company can only be great if it offers the same amount of customer service to its customers. but if you offer great deals and your customer service sucks i wont shop at your store. and that's the problem i find with publix, i'm a people person and i enjoy talking to people i really hate to see someone mistreated or talked about"
good,The benefit package is excellent. Starting pay is better than average for comparable work in other places with raises given in 6 month increments. Opportunity for advancement is possible in any given department.
good,"A lot of my friends and family either work or have worked at publix and there is one consistent complaint about the stores in this city; management problems. It seems that a large percentage of the promotions at publix go to people with terrible people skills, which is concerning considering publix is expected to have the nicest staff. Great to customers, awful to employees."
good,It's not employee friendly. It's customer driven. I simply did not like working there. It was good for the first few weeks as your learn the different work function. There was a lot of employees not pulling their weight and was allow to slide by management.
good,"It is sometimes a very unfair company they don’t reward good behavior and they don’t recognize good workers. I think some of their policies are ridiculous, especially the Publix promise."
good,my time spent with publix was great to be honest but when you start getting into the culture of the company it was not what i expected. the people that work for publix though are top notch.
good,"It had better benefits than most chains as far as I'm aware. The managers do seem more hands on, and always greet you. The work culture was good overall, but the pandering to customers was sometimes way too apparent at the cost of customer morale."
good,"Working for Publix has become much more challenging since I first started with the company.  Much of this could be due to the highly competitive nature of the food industry, but I found my job to be both boring and overly regulated.  I believe that many people might be able to deal with a standard 8 hour shift, but the move to management as proven to be too difficult for me.  The hours are long and inconsistent.  Some days you open the store, which means coming in before 7am, other days you are closing, which can mean leaving after midnight depending on your position."
good,The management was great. I always received the amount of hours I needed to work. My coworkers were all very friendly and easy to get along with. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers and helping them with what they needed.
good,"Great place to work,,Job security,,just gotta stay focus on doing your job and being safe..great with moving up in management and lead position.pay raises ok.. Being able to advance to different jobs is a plus also"
good,Good company to work for.  Good place to shop.  Pleasant shopping experience for everyone.  Some of the best quality products and if you cant find it at another store I guarantee we will have it and if we dont we will personally order it for you.
good,Great benefits but the bakery department need to change some of the work criteria. This department need more hours and more associates. Mangers need more hours to help with the work demand.
good,A good first job if you do not mind working hard for your money.Part-time work hours range from 26-35 hours depending on how open you are.paid weekly is a bonus for all publix employees.
good,They are unable to separate personal feelings from their professional aspects. also when you bring up issues about your department manager to your district manager or store manager they refuse to do anything about your issues except simply talking to them about it.
good,"On a daily basis in the warehouse, the expectation is unrealistic. You don't always have enough equipment to accomplish the necessary duties of your job. They emphasize safety, yet they are slow about making necessary repairs. As with any company it has it's benefits and it's issues, but overall I would rate the company average."
good,A typical day at work is trying your hardest to make all the customers happy. You learn to deal with uncomfortable situations and how to be sociable. Working with my employees and making the customer happy.
good,"Publix was a very busy, friendly place to work. Customer service is the number one priority. I enjoyed working for publix because of the vast opportunity to be promoted and to learn valuable work skills."
good,This job is good for a student who is still in high school trying to work their way up and I had a good experience because I also learned about sales and being a cashier while I was there.
good,"Assist customers with grocery needs also provide premier customer service skills to the customers. Cash handling skills are required also assist with western unions, money orders and customer complaints."
good,"George Jenkins would be rolling in his grave if he knew what corporate was doing to this wonderful company he created. How do we take down this CEO? He's running Publix into the ground. In a few years, Publix will be like every other grocery store as the incentive to care is being taken away."
good,Great company friendly just need work on training some managers to work with people. They are flexible with kids in school. Great with communityand helping customers.
good,"The Publix Deli is almost always busy, and the fast-paced food-service environment can sometimes be stressful. Skills involve preparing and cooking meals, slicing meat, making sandwiches, restocking the sales floor and the deli items, thoroughly cleaning on a regular basis, and extensive customer interaction.  "
good,"Before reading my review, it should be noted that Publix was my first job. Also, not all Publix stores are the same even though they try to be. The way your store will be depends on the customers, the area, and the employees themselves. I started working here (I'm leaving in 2 months though) when I was 19. I am now 22, and the Publix that I started at has changed for the most part. Assignments used to be tedious, but more or less easy to manage when you first start out. However, as the years have gone along, work has become more challenging for some departments over others. Deli and Grocery (at my store) have it the hardest. While the difficulty of the department comes down completely to the managers, more often than not, you will have to continuously try to fit more work in with less time. While it wasn't as bad at first, over the years, this plus the less benefits give to part-timers only made working at Publix worse. Before, my store used to have decent managers that would make me more than happy to work under them. I even worked over 12 hours one time VOLUNTARY. Now that my managers have been switched out with managers that don't really listen to the opinions of the employees anymore, my morale for this job has reached an all time low. Most of the team is filled with new people with little to no experience in this job type making work take longer than it needs to, the manager has turned the store back room into a mess, and now that I've graduated from college, I have no real need to stay anymore."
good,"My experience in the Service Department was professional and casual in terms of relationships with employees. The environment is very fast-paced and attentive, but only when a normal flow of customers are coming in. The only fault in the department is the large amount of micro-management that is constituted by the staff. It makes for an uncomfortable atmosphere and a feel as though you can never relax without being commented on or reprimanded."
good,"Very Good place to work, you will enjoy it if you make it your career you can go really far! Management is Amazing. The most enjoyable part of the job is making customers happy on their way out."
good,Publix has many good things about it and some not so good. The department you work in can really make your day enjoyable or make some days more challenging.
good,"Pay is good and good benefits.  Very busy and fast pace.  "
good,"making sure food is properly prepared. shift running smoothly."
good,Working 2nd shift at publix and having a life will be difficult your times are not 8 hours of work. you will either work over or under 8hrs. They do how ever work with you to get your 40hrs but in some departments overtime will be a shallow experience
good,"The decorum of employee/manager interaction was distasteful. I thought the company did a fantastic job, collectively, to ensure customer satisfaction."
good,"Needs some improvement on balancing newly hired people and those who are willing to work and been there for 2+ years. Productive overall. Good benefits, an O.K atmosphere"
good,"Overall, I think it is a good company to work for, but not necessarily in the deli department. The deli was always short handed. I was part-time and worked 40 hours a week or more, with no benefits."
good,"Great company with bad managers,could make working there draining. Overall can make a career there if pursued, plenty of chances to advance."
good,"A typical day a work consist of coming to work at 3 a.m. and stocking we open up the store around 7 a.m. I continue to stock and greet customers and go on break at around 8:30; after the hour break I return to finish up my shift stocking and organizing back stock at 12 p.m. The management is always willing to work with you to achieve your goals. The workplace at 3 am isn't the happiest hour for people to come in, however I enjoyed going at this time and we wall got along to make working together enjoyable. The hardest part of the Job was working while the store was almost constantly understaffed but above all that I enjoyed seeing the regular customer and working along side my managers and co-workers."
good,I loved the company as a whole because I believe they care about their employees. I do not like some of the management teams at a few stores. I believe corporate can do a better job of choosing who they allow to be managers.
good,the managers are really strict and the customers can be a little demanding. But the benefits are really nice and if you stick with the company and work hard you can move up fairly quickly in this place..
good,"Bad Hours, Standing for a long time, not good if you are just a college kid trying to make ends meet, great if you want to move up in the company"
good,"It was stressful, but i learned valuable life skills. I sliced meets and cheese, made sandwiches, and prepared meals. I worked with other people that were my age, so it made it more of a fun work environment."
good,"Just as the title describes Publix is ideal for people looking for a little extra money. It is not a money pit where you can retire in a short amount of time although they are a billion dollar company."
good,"overall stress free "
good,I really learned a lot and moved forward with this company. They have great opportunities and benefits. I learned fast and correctly trained. I really enjoyed working here
good,"I worked for this company the last 5 years and have learned  a lot  of experience through retail, management and customer service."
good,"You have to solve customer complaints with a smile and be able to work fast and efficiently. Don't expect much help from your management, co-workers tend to help more, the management just wants the job done well, they don't care for much else."
good,"Monotonous work duties, poor raises, and no discounts on food unfortunately.  Stock options after 1 year.  Management always seemed too busy to care about the lower level workers but still tried to pretend to know you.  After one year of working there, I received a $0.03 raise."
good,"People speak highly of publix and it is a good job, but far from the best place ive worked at. "
good,"In my experience, the managers at the publix's I worked in were mostly mean and not understanding in the slightest. they had terrible inter- and intra-personal skills and refused to treat the staff with respect."
good,"Publix is far away from where I live, so I quit working there from January 2, 2016. The working environment was friendly and safe."
good,Very Good place to work nice people good atomosphere the management need to get better but overall good place to work...
good,"shift work, good co workers, the hardest is schedule rotation rotating days off, trouble shoot maintain and repair equipment,"
good,I've been working for Publix and devoted lots of my time and still no offer of fulltime has been mentioned I was told by my Store manager that I needed to be available whenever which seems impossible when I have a family and contradicts Publix Family values. The only thing keeping me there is Health Bennies not the Pennies.
good,"Associates are like family, well trained and organized. There is opportunity to move up, however management hours make it hard to  raise a family. A large amount of drama, politics, and favoritism."
good,"Arrive at work usually to close. I would sliced meat, cooked chicken, and made subs for customers till it was time to close. At about eight I began to complete all the task needed to close down the deli properly. Usually was able to clockout around 11:30 p.m.."
good,"High stress level of a job/career. This goes for any pharmacy, not just publix. Great place to work. Family environment. Definite job security."
good,"fast pace, 75 % of the time short staff. Hard to get full time. management is great, I have learned more about customer service, co workers are great. hardest part is not all the managers are on the same page far as policy so one says this another says the other.. great part is working with some amazing people who have become my friends."
good,You can move up quickly and raises are good. Loved the co-workers and management was okay. Overall love the family friendly environment.
good,"Walk in the break room, clock in look at the assignment board go find other grocery clerk, manager say's im not doing what's on the board, im doing something totally different, what I learned I had to teach myself why because the ""trainers"" in my department didn't know what to do, as I progressed training myself I feel I've gotten faster and efficient, but management didn't see it that way, management is horrible I would never work for Publix again ( well the one(s) I worked at), co-workers are somewhat cool people, hardest part of the job was not getting trained the right way the manager wanted me to do things, most enjoyable part of the job leaving those stores for good. All the things that was said in the video was a lie besides the 401K"
good,"This was my first job as a bagging associate. As such, a typical day involved my working the checkout lanes bagging, but I'd also open and close store from time to time. Also, I would often go above and beyond in trying to direct customers in the right headings as to where things are located and what kinds of oils and ingredients they needed. All and all, it was a great introduction to hardy workforce and I learned how to coordinate with coworkers and management in appropriate ways. And in so doing, made myself more cognizant of ways of conciliatory methods in problem solving in team environments."
good,"Great company to be a part of, with great benefits along the way of a career. Management is not the best, depending on the store you work for. Some have power in there heads and like to belittle but overall and great place to work."
good,"A typical day working for Publix is full of many learning opportunities.  Each day for me starts with walking the store scanning all items on endcaps and displays to make sure the prices are advertised correctly.  Each day I learn new ways to make myself quicker with the tasks assigned to me.  The people I work with are very much reliable which makes it the most enjoyable part of my job.  The hardest part of my job is making sure I get everything done within my time limit. Some days I have more to do than others and not a lot of time to do it in.  When i comes to management, I understand that people are not always fair and you will not always get along with all of the managers above you, I find it hard to deal with management while working here,  because they are hard to locate in the store and they hardly take time to listen to employees."
good,Publix is a good place to start working if you have good customer service skills and able to co exist calmly with the other associates and managers there.
good,"A typical day would be unloading trucks, assisting customers with their questions, and carrying out tasks given down by managers."
good,"Publix was a decent company to work for. They're all about the money, and they can treat the employes like dirt at times. I need to work"
good,just another day at work. co workers were fun to work with. i did what i was told to do. was independent. i am consistent. hardest part of job was not losing my patience to people
good,"management at store i was at, was horrible. soon as someone told on you even if it wasn't your fault write ups were being made. nice people to serve though."
good,"I have worked & served for WestChase  Publix for nine years. During my tenure working/serving for Publix Supermarkets, I worked as a Front-Service Associate or Grocery Bagger. While working for Publix Supermarkets, I have learned the values of being a diligent worker, helping others, and being conscious of the environment."
good,"i fry latin products and put in hot case."
good,"Publix is a great place to work for, assuming you are working in a good location. My store is one with less traffic, and as such the management doesn't always take it very seriously. It is what you make it though and as long as you can deal with difficult customers and coworkers, it's not too bad."
good,"Good place overall, but at times there were too many managers in one place and there was bad communication between them."
good,You can work 50 plus hours for being a Mgr. And be told you worked too many hours. If your taking care of the customers what does it matter.
good,"A typical day at Publix would start out okay, but sometimes it was wasn't so great. Managers had favorites on who they wanted to succeed. They don't believe in fair treatment among the workers."
good,"liked all my coworkers, the hardest part of my job is when we have alot of orders but not enough help. I love my job"
good,"Brings great energy to customers and co-workers, teaches to be responsible."
good,"I learn to treat people well, to serve them and make them feel good, my coworkers were really friendly, management were good but really strict, the hardest part of the job was putting the carts back from the parking lot, the most enjoyable part was helping customers and make them feel good"
good,Publix is great if you are full time or want to have a career in Publix. The benefits the company is great if you are full time or managment. Publix is very hard place to get full time unless you are hired in as full time. The culture is great between associates and managers. the culture is also great to customers and treat them as #1 priority.
good,"Schedule is all over the places,good work environment.You have to work hard."
good,"It is a job, long and crazy hours created by a computer. Some managers need to be more supportive of their employees. Do not treat people as tools"
good,I worked there six months the employment experience was a decent one the managers were okay at the location that I looked at.
good,"Publix is a decent place to work because your co-workers become like family.  You also have great stock options after you are vested in the company.  However, management can be corrupt and does not always set a good example for the company."
good,"Overall an enjoyable experience. Gained experience in constant customer interaction, breading and frying chicken as well as many other skills. There are good benefits but it is very difficult to secure a FT position. PT employees are not eligible for benefits."
good,"Its a good job and I like helping the customers.  By making subs, platters, fried foods and cutting meat orders.  I was always stocking tea, cold products, deli products.  Constantly cleaning everything from the coolers to dishes, windows, meat cutters, if you can name anything in that deli I personally cleaned it.  The management was the worst I've ever had.  There was no personal training in anyway and I felt they threw me in to a pool when I clearly wasn't ready to swim.  Also the co-workers were to busy to help me so I jumped right in.  Lucky I'm a quick learner and did fine ; others weren't so lucky.  I did like the challenge even though others don't and I've seen a lot of people quit their first day from this lack of training.  I wanted to excel and learn everything and move up though management but couldn't because lack of training in our own deli."
good,"As a pharmacist we work long hours, deal with people at their worst, must manage inventory, scheduling, watch our profit margin, monitor patients medications profiles, be available for physician, patient, and other healthcare provider consultation, ensure prescriptions are filled accurately and in a timely manner, conduct healthcare and immunization clinics, and often act as counselors for our patients on topics not entirely related to their prescriptions.  That is a typical day for most of us.  And this is no different for me at Publix.  What makes me able to do it all, is surrounding myself with wonderful support personnel.  I believe that with a positive attitude, patience, team effort, and hard work success is attainable.  Sometimes it is difficult to deal with micromanagement, but I tell my team not to take these things personally.  Remember, the patients that we impact on a daily basis. There are patients who think of us as family, because we have made such an impact in their lives, and that is what is important."
good,"Can be hard work and hours can be very long. Store management varies wildly, and some managers are very poor. Benefits are good for the industry, but becoming full time can be very difficult depending on the store."
good,They used to care but now its all about making money . There benfits are good . If your managers dont care about the department then it sucks to work there . There is a big gap between management and the high level management . The high level guys only look at numbers they dont know whats going on in the stores they just want to make money . They need to give the managers control of there departments back so they can take care of it
good,Working in the different departments learning the different meats and ensuring the customers received their purchases with happiness. I learn that I can do a lot of things at once. I enjoy making floral arrangements. The hardest thing about my job was ensuring that floral area stay clean during Valentine's Day.
good,Hard work for somewhat average/slightly above average industry wage for the job.
good,"Customers and co-workers were, for the most part, very nice people."
good,Decent to work for. They do not like to give full-time. I was employed there for six years. I had ten hours for the entire month of August. That is when I decided to work elsewhere.
good,"Publix was a great place to work, it was face-paced and very clear on how they wanted you to operate. The customers were almost always friendly and made the job a very nice place to work at. However, in my particular store the people I worked for were in a clique and made working there a constant battle."
good,This grocery store was all about customer service in which every employee  assisted and helped customers throughout their shopping experience
good,"Good place to work, except work/life balance.I work part-time and the hours are very inconsistant."
good,"If you want to make a career out of Publix then you're going to have to bust you butt.  Moving up in Publix takes longer than expected, but once you get to that manager position i'tll all be worth it if that's what you want to do.  Can be overwhelming at times since they want you t to pretty much start at minimum wage and the rate at which they want you to work.  The most enjoyable part of the day is talking to customers and when you clock out to go home."
good,Enjoy greeting all customers upon entry of store. Learn a large amount of codes to ensure a timely check-out. Management is very approachable. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers at time. The most enjoyable part is seeing a difficult customer turn around and became an satisfied customer!
good,A typical day would have been to assist customers with any issues. Assist with supervising cashiers and daily task. Also maintaining a clean store. Counted large sums of money on a daily. Made sure a customer had a great experience while shopping in store. Also cashier at times.
good,Stock shelves
good,A typical day at work is very busy always in contact with customers.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me assisting customers with finding products, ringing them up, and on days I was a bagger, walking them to their vehicles. While being a cashier I would have to return unpurchased items to the shelves while organizing the shelves [called blocking]. While a bagger, I would sweep, mop, and vacuum he store in addition to maintaing the bathrooms and taking out the trash. I have learned the value of customer service throughout my experience as well as the importance of being a team player. Management was abreeze to work with and made the job as comfortable as working could be. My co-workers were a blast because I saw them as friends. The hardest part of the job was having to collect all the shopping carts in the rain as a female, however, the most enjoyable part was being able to help people."
good,The work place was nice but no hours. I have a big family and 3-15hrs a week isn't enough
good,i spent 4 months with publix and through the time was not all that good mangement gets on you alot
good,"Days were busy. Teamwork, working on a register, leadership. Management was very good. Coworkers worked well together. Not enough to do. Interacting with customers and coworkers."
good,"Working overnight was cool, as it was fast paced. The overnight supervisor usually changed radio stations and cranked up the music to help us keep a fast pace. However, do watch you back dealing with politics."
good,I learned that working around people you have to have get along with them rather you like them or not. learn how to keep you mouth close about things you shouldn't talk about at work even if someone start the topic.Smile talk at a short end do your best come in on off days come prepared to work dont be late reason with people and more if not your day wont go wll.
good,It was a fun learning experience. Great customer interaction and fun work environment.
good,"Typical day involved coming in early and bagging groceries, sweeping and mopping the isles, occasionally helping stock shelves, cleaning bathrooms, taking out trash, collecting carts and helping customers load their groceries into their vehicles."
good,"We had to at every end of night, go and straighten every isle back in its place. Some employees would take their time to milk company hours, while others who wanted to go home had to work faster to help out the milking employees."
good,"This is a great entry level job, which does give incredible benefits if you wish to make a lifetime career from it. If you are looking to move up, it does take a very long time however. I was part time for four years before I was offered a full time position. I was always deeply hardworking and goal oriented, however I received a full time offer from my second job at that time after only having worked there for 4 months. That second job then became my priority, and I kept my job at Publix until I became a manager at my second job. A great company, but I wanted to move up a bit quicker than I was able to at Publix. My managers were incredible, and they were flexible with me in allowing me to put in the time I needed to continue to work towards my goals at my second job."
good,"Publix is a good company with flexible hours and great benefits, however while they hope to be a company with plenty of opportunities for advancement that’s not always the case, management is constantly changing from store to store so you fluctuate from working with good/bad managers. They will remind you that if you were to leave your position would be filled immediately, even once you’re one of the “important” people.  Customers are often very difficult to ha for."
good,"The good:"
good,"Worked in the Deli. Management hounds you, pushes you, disrupts you and honestly makes things less efficient sometimes. It’s tougher if you cook. It’s back breaking work, very stressful, and same pay."
good,"It was good, managers were great, it didn't fit my needs specially since I am in college, got sick a lot since I was cleaning bathrooms too many times a week, but fair pay."
good,Publix is a decent environment to work...It's a little stressful for me and I would like something closer to home.  I also prefer to work behind the scenes and not directly with the public.
good,It's a pretty ok job for what it is worth I like my co workers . And some of the managers don't mind helping you out. You do have the ones that will not help you but will complain about it.
good,I learned how to be a leader publix taught me how to take care of the customers needs and wants and we all have a job to do so I learned to do multiple task because if you are strong in one are somewhere else you are smuggling
good,Working for Publix is great if you are looking for part-time work or are young. Full time is for those who are serious about the company. Longevity is the key to being successful at Publix!
good,"Easy Work If You Have A Great Mindset If You Not It Will Be Stressfull."
good,I loved my associates and how easy it was for me to request off when I needed to. they were very flexible and they ca be understanding about personal issues. BUT the managers can be very hard to work with and are unreasonable in regards to how fast you are working. they also have bullies in some departments that managers over look.
good,As stated with current growth it is critical newly promoted management needs access to all applicable training in order to ensure the business is ran with both professionalism and positive performance
good,"Greet customers and respond to questions and requests for information."
good,I work at the customer service desk but get paid as a cashier and i just feel like i don't get paid enough to deal with the stress that i get from this job.i also feel like my work isn't appreciated. i go above and beyond to satisfy my customers and follow all the rules and when its time for my evaluation they always find an excuse to not give me a decent raise.
good,I did not feel appreciated as a worker and my hours were often cut. I felt as though I was working for free and when I expressed that nothing changed management isn’t amazing
good,It was a great place to work. But the people I work will  especially the full timers are the worst people to work with very lazy. But the pay is good and there is a lot of opportunities you just have to work your but off for it.
good,Publix would be a great place to work if it weren't for the obnoxious customers and micromanaging employees. Be prepared to be treated on a subhuman level.
good,"For your first job, Publix is a great place to find out what it's like to be in a  fast paced working environment. If you're looking for advancement in job positions, Publix lacks the will to get you there. I worked part time, and when I would get raises, my hours would be cut for a few weeks. Be prepared for what the job brings as far as where you'll be placed. If you, however, are looking for a job with excellent flexibility, Publix would be it."
good,"I still love my job, but it's not what I see myself doing forever. If you're looking into it it has its ups and downs. Depending on where you are and apply for,  it can be a very rewarding experience. Just put your best foot forward and apply yourself for the best possible benefits."
good,"Benefits are a plus but the pay is not very competitive. I would recommend Publix for someone close to retirement or highschool/college students. Anyone in the late '20s, 30 or early 40 years of age try aiming for companies with higher wages and a 401k elsewhere. Just my opinion, also my experience thus far as well."
good,"The management at least at my store, were not as pleasing.. For all the hard work I did I dont get recognized. I only get partially recognized during the evaluations. The manager at the bakery was very strict to even me as a hard worker.. It takes a few years to fire someone that doesint do their job correctly.. Good benefits, an alright place to work with good pay.. Just very stressful. Deli manager was great and the customer service manager was ok. When I wanted to transfer stores as a bakery clerk they kept telling me no wait, and they said "" The store you want to transfer to doesint want a person that goes to different departments at a short amount of time."" I thought that was manager material though.."
good,"I used to look forward to going to work , now, When our Customer Service Manager works I don't want to go in! She's not real, she's just indescribable! I hate my day! I Love working for Publix & I get along w/every single one of my managers except her! God help me! I really have to pray when I work with her!! I'm really not the only one that feels this way!!!......"
good,"Customers know that no matter how wrong they are, they are right; so some are very nasty and inconsiderate. Starting pay is low and you can very easily max out your pay grade. I was evaluated as role model but went years without raises because I maxed out my pay grade."
good,"They hire part time so they have to wait a year to give you healthcare. Part time sucks. It’s 2-3 days IF you’re lucky. So you’re screwed for money so definitely plan on having a 2nd job. 100%! No paid time off, no holiday pay and no real benefits at all. It’s garbage. I was promised 30-35hrs a week now I’m getting only 28-21. No one can live on that. I’m planning on staying as long as I can but am looking for something full time. It’s a great company if you get full time. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
good,6.00am start your day checking your machines.clean flower under machines.take lugs to harper.takelugs to sanitation to be clean/run line 3 muffin quality control. 2.30 clock out.
good,working at publix can be nice. as long as there is good organization within the management and they are able to help it makes working there bearable. sometimes the customers may take more priority than the task you are given.
good,"After working at Publix for nearly three years I found myself in need of a career change due to the unlivable wage provided for part-time employees. I attempted for the entirety of my time at the company to get into a full-time position and was shot down every time by management, only to find people that were hired on as full-time or were there for less time, and then promoted to full-time. To be clear, I put in as much work, if not more, than some of the people that were hired after me and got full-time. The selection process seems unfair in that regard for who gets full-time positions."
good,"Dental and Vision benefits start quickly, but difficult to get health unless a certain amount of hours are achieved.  Employee owned company and if you want to buy stock in the company, you have the option."
good,"Publix is a good place to work. they provide good service to the customers willing to always help the customer in what they need."
good,The deli was under managed and had poor management in general. Stressful environment that was usually messy. Coworkers are nice and enjoyable to work with.
good,The Publix that I worked at was amazing for customers but as a part- time employee you did not receive many benefits.  The scheduling was very confusing and you often would not receive the proper amount of hours to work in a week.
good,"As a part-time cashier who has to interact with customers throughout their shift and talk with them, we are not allowed to have a bottle of water at our register because it looks unprofessional! Taking no regards to the fact that you have to converse with the customers and be friendly and polite is good, but they never let us have a bottle of water when your mouth gets dry from talking with people all day long. You're scheduled to have a break for 30 minutes and God forbid if you have to go to the bathroom. So I guess that's why they don't let you have a bottle of water at your register because that means you would have to leave the register because of bodily functions. Don't be a cashier at Publix, work on the stock crew or other departments at least you have more flexibility and can move around."
good,Working for Publix was a great experience for me because of the constant interaction with customers. It taught me how to be more forward and problem solve what the customer is looking for. My position required a lot of movement due to the face paced environment which allowed me to be quick on my feet. But unfortunately I had to relocate and I am no longer employed at Publix
good,"The best perk was flexible hours for school. Every semester, I had different days off depending on my school schedule and there was rarely a problem with management."
good,Is a good place to work but not enough for a living for a part-time like me not enough hours. If you where to work a full-time I think it would be more and still very demanding.
good,Paying your dues at Publix is rough. It can be rewarding if you stick it out. Advancement opportunities are clearly laid out for you. Not really any work/life balance. I was part time scheduled 28 hours yet averaged 38 working hours. We as a grocery team could not leave until everything was done so shifts could stretch well past standard closing hours.
good,"I shop for ingredients and then I cook the featured recipe of the day, I interact with the customer and offer them a sample of my feature recipe."
good,"In the 6 or 7 months of being at Publix, I learned plenty about customer service and how to be a good employee. My coworkers were friendly and made what was a slow yet somewhat hectic job bearable.My managers were also good. Most of what I've learned has came from the Team Leader. I was even offered benefits such as health and stock opportunities. Unfortunately, they failed to meet my expectations regarding hours. Not to mention, even with Publix being more on the expensive side of things, an employee discount is not offered despite the low amount of hours given to minors."
good,You will always have some work to do in this work area it’s never nothing to do . The best station is the sub shop but you have to deal with a lot of attitudes and others issues from customers
good,Publix was ok at first but after while I found I had to beg to be moved up or to any other department. The pay rate was awful. I worked harder and faster than any other co worker also trained every new bagger and cashier that came in.
good,over wellming for position and mng. in charge cutting corner for performance and just to praise employees for everything the company accomplish but nevern rewards for it!!!
good,Not the best place to work. Benefits are only offered to those that are full time which is hard to receive at this company. Management also isn’t the best! The work is easy bet yet you’re working long hours of the day with a small pay rate.
good,"I love my coworkers. The customers and we are like family.  "
good,"If you like the people you work with, you'll like your job. As a stockholder, you're literally stocking shelves, unloading the truck, and helping customers. It's not a hard job, but the pay isn't great and neither are the benefits. Also, no employee discount."
good,"Publix is a great company. It has great benefits and pay, but the hours are long (60-70 hr weeks, sometimes a 100) and your salaried so no OT. Can cause burn out,"
good,Liked coming in and being greeted and learning the ropes of “customer service” but after training the hours really lacked between all publix co workers
good,"Start your next occasion at Publix Aprons Event Planning in your neighborhood Publix. We'll do the work planning all your events, from family gatherings to special occasions to business functions."
good,"If you want to advance your career there, it is a good place to work but if you are on the verge of it, do not do it. You have to be all in for Publix, if not you won't enjoy it."
good,"My Publix job was conveinent for a first job. Close to home and learned about customer service. "
good,Worked in 2 departments. Deli and Cashier. Constant business at the deli and hours. Cashier not so much. Surprisingly most customers were very nice if they see you're friendly and working hard. Constant cleaning task and customers so the day goes by fast.
good,"If your looking for a job that gives amazing benefits, Publix is the job for you. I would recommend that if your interested in the benefits, to apply as a full-timer. Not many employees are full time, therefore, it is competitive for the full-time spot."
good,"the managers were nice, productive and easy work. i put that i can work anytime on the weekends but they put me on for only three hours each week. it paid a little over minimum wage."
good,Bothered me that you have to be clean shaved. The customers in this area will treat you kinda bad sometimes. (It is a wealthy area). After a while it will get to you and you will be annoyed. You could complain to the managers and they will listen but won't do a thing about it.
good,"No fair pay for the amount of work. However, the good side of this job is that people set their own schedule. "
good,"Some location are very demanding and poorly managed by Store managers with only Publix experience and poor people skills . They trying work based off company culture ,but tend to steer away base on the situation ."
good,"I was a part time employee for 3 years.  I started as a Bagging Clerk and moved to Cashier, and then on to Seafood Clerk.  I learn how to interact with customers and fellow employees.  I learned to handle stressful situations and problem solving."
good,"This job is a good starter job. Not too many hours to be given out, and the pay isn't great, but it can lead to advancement to management. Overall the work environment is very friendly and professional."
good,Publix is a decent company to work for. The benefits are awesome. There will always be job security and advancing in the company is not hard to do. However I wish there was more detailed training and better communication skills from management.
good,Publix has changed alot from the time I started to the time I left. They used to have cookouts for employees. There much more of a family atmosphere in the beginning and It doesnt feel that way anymore.
good,"Honestly I wouldn't make a Publix a career.  Corporate has taken over so, management don't have much control.  The changes now(especially in grocery) are ridiculous.  They have changed so much and expect way too much out of us now(especially in grocery).  The pay is good but what you put up with is not worth it.  The long nights closing in grocery are the hardest part of the job.  The most enjoyable part is interacting with customers."
good,"Too many chiefs,and I’m a chief saying that. There are multiple levels of management and they keep adding to it. They need to eliminate some levels of middle management"
good,"Fast pace working environment "
good,"My day work can start at any time morning or evening, never is the same. I have learned many things about their culture as a place oriented firstly to the costumer service satisfaction, they are all the time update your knowledge about safe, procedures, etc. In my case I came from Cuba a just year and a half ago and I've had to learn a whole new register system and a new way to interact with the costumers, the management is very good in my case they have been collaborative with my and also they give a good example for the rest of the workers, because they also are handworkers. Publix is a place with a big culture to serve and satisfaction to the costumers, the hardest part of the job for me is not the costumers relationship, even the English, the worse part for me, is the day when they publish the schedule for the next week and I see that get just a few hours to work, but and the same time I see how they contract new people for work as part time, I can't understand that, is frustrating for me, and also I don't like when they put me like a bagging because I want to be a cashier, the other bad part is that cashiers can't have a chair in the register and is hard to be so long standing even if they give you 10 minutes for take a rest. The most enjoyable part is the relationship that I can make with the costumers that's easy for me."
good,Publix was a good place to work in retail. Customer centered and based. Plenty of opportunities for advancements and employee owned so chances for management.
good,Decent times to work and pay is better than most entry jobs. Ability to move forward into management and cross-train in different areas of the store for additional hours. Good culture to work and employees are mostly fun to work around.
good,Great place to shop. Not the greatest to work. Will be overworked and underpaid. Been here six years now as a full time grocery replenishment specialist I make a whopping 1.50 more than whoever gets hired as a part time grocery clerk tomorrow. Associates are generally friendly and the benefits provided are excellent but if your not a high school/ college kids there are far better opportunities out there.
good,"It a good place to work with a flexible schedule if you are in school. but It is very hard to move up. A typical day is me going to the break room clocking in a looking what time I am going to be bagging and what time I am going to be going to register and what time my break is. Then If I am bagging I go out to the floor and I look for an empty register and go to work, but if there is no one to bag for I go out and get a few rounds of carts until someone goes outside or until someone goes home or until I take over for someone. If I am scheduled to be a cashier then I find what number register I am on and go there going to work checking people out in a timely manner. I learned how to become a team player and how to work with customers that might not be the happiest.The management isn't the best. They tell you will be moved up and nothing ever works out."
good,Its a great place to work if you are ambitious and really want to work there long term. The benefits are great and always encourgeeeee you to apply for them.
good,"You have the opportunity to grow with the company if you really desire, and that's pretty cool. Some of the benefits from the past have been removed, which isn't cool."
good,"Since i worked at Publix i have met many different people."
good,"Publix is a great place to work for college students. My schedule was very flexible, so that I was able to be a full-time student and work part-time on the weekends. My manager was great at making sure my schedule was how I needed it, and was also a great mentor for me. Advancement can be tough as you have to be a Publix employee for numerous years before moving up, but if you stay long enough the opportunities are there! They also have great stock options for full-time associates, and part-time associates can purchase stock. Overall it's a good company to work for."
good,Publix was decent to work for after training you are basically on your own... everyone is competing to keep up their production percentage that no one is able to lend a hand
good,"From my experience, advancement in to management is more based on your tenure than your actions. Seems like they care less about employees and more about the profits. But, it is very hard to get fired and you do not need more than a high school education to get in to management. Terrible hours, but great stock options (for now)."
good,"The company isn't keen on firing people unless you do something crazy like stealing or threatening customers. This does have a downside as many lackluster employees will be with the company for a very long time. A lot of the benefits are available to part time as well as full time employees, so long as you have the required hours. It should be easy to get a promotion to better positions, however depending on the manager, this may not be the case. I never had issues, but I would see friends who weren't friends with the right people turned down for promotions despite being more than capable at the job."
good,management was very poor. I understand of course customer is always first but they did not care bout their employees not for one bit. employees got blamed for everything.
good,"Publix is a great place to work because you get a wide variety of food and a great atmosphere to shop ."
good,"Publix is a great company to work for some of the managers treat like Dogs and do not understand that mistakes happen we are only human. "
good,"The great thing about Publix is that they are a good provider for your family. "
good,"In my time at Publix, I found that the customer yielded far more power than in any other retail or hospitality job I'd ever held before. No matter how rude or vulgar, customers were always paraded with a silver spoon in their mouths while associates were only bribed with minimalist stock. Management, be it department, store, or district, is lazy, at best, or if they are hard-working, take far too much vacation time and expect far too much for always being understaffed and overworked with no options for OT."
good,"Management is really good at Publix they have a open door policy, do any questions or concerns they are more than happy to listen. I have learned all the codes for fruits and vegetables. The hardest part is standing around mostly if you are a cashier."
good,Retail is retail. It's a great company to work for. I've enjoyed my time working for Publix. Many great benefits. Meet so many people and develop many lasting relationships
good,"High paced work with a lot to do everyday, with not much compensation. Hours vary and are often all over the place. Great benefits as far as stock options."
good,You are required to do all the work that big pharmacy companies do with the lowest pay. The pharmacy makes very little revenue for the company. Not many opportunity to for growth once you are a manager.
good,"when the new higher up management took over, publix was no longer a family place to work.. corporate america took over. its almost like a military atmosphere."
good,From the benefits to my interactions with supervisors and to the work environment my experience is overtly positive. The people  I worked with were great.
good,"Stocking items on to sleeves ensuring all barcoded items were properly placed in the correct isle and shelf.  We performed daily janitorial duties to include removing trash and cleaning warehouse. "
good,I found good friends and people i genuinely enjoyed working with that i still keep in contact with. The job was very team oriented. The only can was that i felt that the management acted a little entitled toward staff lower down than them.
good,Great place to advance. I had a raise every three months I think. I worked in the deli section. It's always a little stressful working with feeding the general public. But nothing un tolerable.
good,Publix is a great company however it can be very stressful to work there especially during the holidays. Stock options are the best part of working here.
good,"Hard work,  great benefits ! Management was unpredictable and showed favoritism. It was12 years ago, so I doubt I could work the fast paced necesssry to be exemplary,  but I did love the interaction with the customers. My main goal every day was to be helpful, pleasant, professional."
good,"Publix maintains a high standard of employee and customer relations. The stock options are second to none. Fulltime employees can retire very well off with the employee stock options. The medical benefits are fair. It can be a very high paces job during holidays and special events. "
good,Great for a student or a single parent. They work around your schedule often and there are no issues usually if something comes up. I left because I relocated.
good,When I started with Publix it was all about the associates in their families it is now all about production of work which little labor I’m flexible hours and no family life outside of PUBLIX
good,Publix has good company benefits if you are with the company long enough.  Long hours and lake of advancement in career even though there is proper experience makes this job undesirable.
good,Publix is a great place to work especially if you're dedicated to the customers and improving their shopping experience. It is challenging to move up because there are so many associates who have the same end goal. In this area there is not a lot of movement and people can be stagnant for years until there is an opening.
good,Years ago employees were treated much better than they are now but I still believe they are better than most companies.  the benefits are excellent in comparison to other grocery chains.
good,"I loved working for publix, I wanted to move up and I was moving up until I got a new store manager and he was nasty. I called corporate on him so many times nothing was done."
good,"I enjoy working at Publix's, but sometimes it can be very stressful. I learned  a lot at Publix's, Management is good because it keep you on your toes. The workplace culture is good. The hardest part of the job is not having tools that you need to run a good department. The best part of the job making the customer happy."
good,constant work load with no breaks. Great customers that keep you smiling. clean work area. Great product.  Typical work day would be setting up the sub station and making fresh salads. Slicing meats for sub kits. cleaning work areas and setting up supplys where needed.
good,Working at Publix was a great pleasure. I've learned a lot while working at Publix such as accounting. The most enjoyable part was working with people who were just awesome people to work with and all looked out for our customers.
good,"At the Publix I work at, the management is awful. For such a big company who promotes how much they care about their customers, you would think they would care about their employees as well correct? Well, wrong. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the managers and the rude customers, but overall it isn't too bad. Publix does teach you a lot about good customer service matters and they also taught me a lot when it came to working a register and handling money. The most enjoyable part would have to be some of the customers you run into and the nice coworkers."
good,"Decent start up job, management plays favorites, a lot of work but you do not see the benefits of your work. Easy to call of days. If you are trying to advance you have to be the managers best friends."
good,"Good benefits, low pay, different management, clean environment, good people around, not for single parent, crazy schedule, takes time to get promoted"
good,Typical work day consist of constantly stocking shelves and assisting customers which I enjoys. I've how to use a pallet jack while offloading trucks the hardest part of my job is offloading a holiday truck which are usually very big deliveries. I also loves the atmosphere and working as a team player.
good,Worked as a stock clerk for a few years and helped bag in front of the store when needed.  This was a good job but was not able to meet/sustain my financial needs.
good,"Great attention customer service, culture fo the company. Prime products. Excellent co worker., I learned to do payroll, schedulle, attention to the customer. Money service. Promise of the company,"
good,"Working at Publix was fun at first and I wanted to move up but after being full time for 8 months I can honestly say that you become a slave to your job. When you are full time, you have as much responsibility as a Team Leader with less pay. You must come in when you are called in no matter what, you must always work with a smile on your face."
good,"A typical day at publix would have to be extremely busy, dealing with many different customers at once. Management is always available when needed, no questions asked. Also, their is many opportunities on working you way up in the company."
good,"I probably worked at a bad store, but the managers and full timers were lazy cause it takes a lot to get fired once you're moved to full time. I worked 3rd shift and generally got along with everyone, very fast paced and not for everyone."
good,"I have worked at Publix for nearly 12 years at 3 different stores.  I have had some good managers and some not so good managers.  I usually get along with everyone I work with.  Overall, it is a fun and fast paced work environment.  The only other issue I have is that advancement can be difficult."
good,My Publix career was a pivotal point in my life. I learned so much about who I am and what I could accomplish. As a meat manager my job was mostly to be on the sales floor driving sales and merchandising products. Driving other associates to obtain sales goals. ABC always be selling!
good,"This job taught me a lot about customer service, teamwork, and sales. "
good,"the culture there seems to be very cut throat, everyone is stepping over each other to move up. the benefits are decent but the stock they give you is very worthwhile. If you love retail its a job worth considering."
good,"working at Publix is good if you enjoy meeting new people, and if you are patient. its a great place to begin with and work your way up, and it has great benefits."
good,"The people that you work with are usually similar to you, but I have yet to have a manager who seemed to want you to advance. Customer service is good if you enjoy meeting a lot of people but your patience will be tested."
good,"Publix talks a lot about how well they treat their employees like they're one big family. To an extent this is true--the pay is decent, hours are generally flexible, and there are loads of benefits if you plan on staying long-term. When it comes to the day-to-day, however, management doesn't really respect you or your time in my experience. Customers are whatever, you have your good ones and your bad ones, but but there is a distinct lack of communication and understanding between the expectations of store/department managers and what the actual associates are capable of given that we are literally always pressed for time."
good,"The skeptical thing at Publix would be the hours they give.one week its alot ,the next week its a little less,and my opinion the worst thing their would be closing,because when you're stocking,you will have to do the freezer too(your hands turn purple by the time you're done)"
good,"Nice place, first experience as a cashier, hard work mentality, a great experience that helped me to improve my communiction skills, cleaning is the hardest part of the job and participating in donation campaign like ""food for sharing"" is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Publix has a great atmosphere to work in do to the principles that are enforced as far as superb customer service goes. They're very well known to treat and to grant customers first at any occasion during working hours. But generally , it can get very demanding do to the overload of merchandise and customers that the store generates everyday."
good,"Look, this job is great if you want that; just a job. It's not the same company it used to be. They'll work with your schedule if you're in school and you get pretty good benefits and vacation time. However, you'll almost never feel like you did enough. You never get a pat on the back."
good,"I've worked 7+ years for this company, and I cherish every character building moment. Publix isn't just a ""job"". It's a culture of good customer service. What I love most, is that the staff really care, and you'll see it in their work ethic. During the Fall season, it can become very busy."
good,I enjoyed working there and enjoyed the staff.  I really enjoyed my roll in the company running the line in the produce snake department. Was no hard parts of the job.
good,The work isn't overbearing it's the lack of communication in the personal progress that is inquired. There is always a great environment that the co workers provide for one another when issues occur.
good,"Drama in the deli,Lack of communication,,lack of team work,Managers lack of communication and leading,management.They don't give you good hours and they cut you hours"
good,"Good company depending on your location. Some store's have a good crew and good set location. Our warehouse is located 4 hours from us, so the punctuality of our trucks differs day-to-day."
good,"Publix is a very good company, I feel they sometimes fail in over all training. The company has very good insurance, and stock options. They do not though really give you a lot of family time. Sometime you get off at 11:00 PM and have to be in the next day at 6:00 AM. which I do not mind except when they do it six days in a row."
good,"Fast pace store , i learned how to fry and make some things i never knew how to do nice management . good co workers in all i enjoyed it because i always make my work fun"
good,"It was a great experience and I learned a lot. Too much responsibility for department managers. Associates not held responsible. A lot of hands-on,physical labor. Great people to work with. The only thing I didn't like was the constant changes in management. In nine years a lot of changes some good and some bad. They d a lot for the community, United Way, March of dimes the Lion's club and many more community events. Great benefits for associates. We receive paid vacation and holidays. Also the best part is as an associate for every so much you make they give you Publixs stock which is not open to the public. Not much more I can add without being negative. I'm done. A lot of heavy lifting depending what department you are in."
good,"Pretty easy job.  Have to be good on your feet and pretty productive.  Customers can be trying sometimes.  Management is kind.  Learned to handle money, use a cash register, and be efficient with time."
good,"A typical day at work requires doing transactions involving money with the utmost focus as well as taking care of customers to the best of your ability. I have learned a lot about communication because of Publix and that should help me with a future career elsewhere. I have also learned that Publix is very political and shows favoritism to workers who already have a relative in the company. They have certain managers who run the store like a communist. So many rules to follow, yet it can be hard to realistically do so. Management needs to be better and Publix should not hire those who have had severe issues with drugs such as cocaine. I work with good co-workers, most of whom respect me and some who don't. I try to make the atmosphere positive, but unfortunately the way the managers run the store make it hard for others to be happy and healthy. Hardest part of the job is honestly dealing with managers that have no people skills and treat others like garbage. The most enjoyable part is getting to make a difference in the customers days when they come to Publix. I have made so many friends with the customers who shop there so much."
good,This is not a part-time structured for a full-time student. It could just be the department I located in and my responsibilities. It greatly conflicted with Job/Life balance. I was not proud of my management department. Again my experiences are based on my locations. Other wise Benefits wise this is an amazing and caring company. Apply and see the amazing benefits that will be provided.
good,"Publix Associates provide world class service at very minimum compensation packages.  Would want to see an improvement in this.  "
good,"A fast-paced customer service environment with a rigid management team.  While there is room for promotion, for those who remain in a certain position the raises are minimal."
good,"Great company, productive, opportunistic,and competitive. Con for working here is that there is no life away from Publix. The hours are ridiculous and employees are worked like robots. Hourly associates under stress for not being able to meet time managed projects, and salary associates working over 60 hours a week to make up for the hourly associates. The work overload is more than what can be logically managed in 40 hours or less. Unfortunately, that is not a concern for the superiors."
good,I really enjoyed working in the Deli with all my co-workers. Loved providing all my customers with great customer service.
good,"I mainly worked as a cashier for the last 3 years, but over time I have become unhappy doing the same routines over and over again.  In the past, I have asked my store manager if I could be full-time and even work a little over in the Produce department, but she declined in both instances.  I was even asked if I could work as a grocery clerk by stocking up candy shelves, but my store manager didn't want that to happen either.  I eventually started feeling upset that no one would really provide advancement at Publix in Winter Garden prior to my resignation."
good,Assists customers with premier service. Assists in other duties as assigned. Assists in locating products. Restock supplies
good,"I meet a lot of great people working at Publix. every day is the same, bagging groceries all day. The hardest part about the job is the inconsistent hours I don't know if I will work six hours or 20 plus the next week."
good,"Cashier are to provide premier customer service to all customers entering the store. This title entails small transactions typically ranging to 200 dollars. Our duty also is to promote fundraisers for local organizations such as: Children's HealthCare of Atlanta, United Way, Special Olympics, etc."
good,Fun fast filled environment working with the public. Was able to grow my leadership at a young teen. Great foundation to help build a career minded individual.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of decorating cakes, pricing pastries, baking cookies, and organizing the baked goods."
good,Fun place to work with nice people and good hours. Management takes care of their employees. They are always pushing for best customer service.
good,"Good starting point for young people trying to get into the workforce at a young age, very consistent with hours for the most part"
good,"Working at Publix can be challenging, specially working on the beach. You get to meet different variety of people from all over the world. You learn to interact with them and making sure they leave the store satisfy."
good,I love Publix a good place to work if u are just looking for a part time job. customers are friendly. and you stay busy all the time make time go by fast. The company rewards it associates every once in a while as a thank you for all they do. publix is more of a family we come together as you do with your family at home.
good,Great place to work but very slow on promoting for hardwork. Publix workers enjoy there daily operations and if you qualify you have opportunity to work in many departments
good,Publix is a great company to have a career with as long as you know how to play the game.  The more people you get to know and the younger you are when you start at this company the more option you have for future advancement.
good,"seeking a challenging position, I get alone with my co-workers. the store coupon and other store compare coupon. when I give the customer the best  customer service that I can with a smile and welcome them back to PUBLIX SUPERMARKET"
good,"Publix has amazing benefits and job security, but that's about it. Advancement is difficult and many employees have a ""don't care"" mentality. To many, it's just a job and a paycheck. This may not be the case at all Publixs, but it certainly is at mine."
good,"The typical workday is about nine hours.  Working at Publix as provided additional experience in manufacturing, specifically food manufacturing.  The management team is supportive of the desire to advance and will help when possible.  The co-workers are great to work with.  I do not find many parts of the job to be difficult.  The most enjoyable part of my job is implementing changes to processes  and training the associates."
good,"A typical day at work is, helping the customers, always on the job, no breaks, and staying positive. What i learned at work was that you should just take your time. Management, always is useful. Management is always an extra kick. My co-workers are always exciting me. They give me inspiration to keep working to either get a better job or just to keep doing good. The hardest part of the job is that when the customers get a little impatient.All that teaches me is to never break character no matter what while working. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you get to see your customers leave with happy faces!"
good,"Great company to work for with good benefits.  Most stores advance from within, however my location favors toward certain nationalities. Hardest part of job is standing all day.  Most enjoyable part is the opportunity to meet and speak with people from all walks of life. Managers show favoritism."
good,Great place to learn alot of buisness skills for free and advance in your own buisness. Not much here for advancement people report that they been in company for years and still not advance to management level. Alot of supervisor positions but no management.
good,Publix itself is a great company with awesome benefits. Biggest issues are scheduling and communication. I enjoyed my coworkers and the fast paced aspect of the job.
good,Publix provides great benefits and job security for its employees. Work life balance is hard to have in an hourly or salary position. Overall you can go far if you want to put the company before your family and friends.
good,"Fast paced environment, the manager are great at providing flexible hours. Great co-workers caring staff, they are very understanding.  Managers have an open door policy. Customers are always treated like king's and queen's."
good,I love working at Publix... I get to meet all kinds of people and enjoy helping them and making them want to come back and shop at Publix
good,"I've worked for Publix for over 2 years, and it's been a long ride. I've had a lot of good experiences, and quite a few bad ones as well. My experiences differ wildly between departments, and the managers really do set the tone for the department."
good,"I am very thankful for my time at Publix. Publix has great benefits for Full-Time employees, this is also sometimes a con, as it can be difficult to advance in the company since there is low turnover among the full-time employees."
good,Overall great company however they are making some serious cutbacks to hours and managers no longer salary
good,"When you first come in you wash your hands and begin setting up the sub stations. Wash off the slicers, check the production sheet then begin making sub kits. In the morning the store is not that busy so you can pretty much get your production done quickly.The hardest part of the day are the lunch rush and dinner  rush."
good,I was a very efficient customer clerk. My work method was nothing but smiles. I had met hundreds of new customers every week. The big downside was for some weeks the work hours were less than 10.
good,"cut sub kits, fix sandwiches and dinner plates. slice meats and cheeses. stock floor"
good,"It's a fun first job for a teen, but once you reach that point where you need something better, it won't be easy to acquire."
good,"Go to your assigned area. That could be clerking or aisle assisting. I learned how culture in America such as ""extreme couponing"" effects employees and customers. The co-workers were always friendly. The job was very short lived as it was meant to be a temporary in between two jobs. There was no extreme difficulty that this job required. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendships that you built in the company."
good,publix 328 is ok to work always packed and some high class customers give nasty attitudes. hate the no beard policy
good,Set up fruits and vegetables where they belong. Receive and unload the daily truck. Remove all out-of-date and questionable items off the shelves. Proceed to throwaway using a handheld terminal. Sort each item received from the truck accordingly. Your day at work may either be enjoyable or execrable depending what kind of managers you deal with. You'll see hard workers as well as some lazy one.
good,"Great place to work, many benefits, opportunities to meet new people, and assist customers. A lot of room for advancement and growth."
good,work was good pay could have been better and over time shouldve been allowed.
good,Publix is a great place for students to work while pursuing their degrees from college.
good,"Learned to have patience and wonderful customer service practice. My co workers are awesome, the management team is hard to work with. The hardest part of the job is to balance and family life. There is no concern about family importance. It is all about the job and making the big wigs more money. I love my co workers and the way they still put a smile on their face regardless of how we are treated."
good,Good Company but Needs improvement at store in management. Great benefits
good,"I love my boss and coworkers. But for the amount of work and the personality changes Publix wants, they don't pay you enough money."
good,"After we paid our house off last year, my wife and I decided it would be better for us financially to change from full-time to part-time status.  Our children are grown now and we have no tax deductions left, so our decision was made easier for that reason. But as a floater pharmacist, Publix managers continuously places demands on my time by insisting that I work more hours than I want, even after stepping  down from full-time to part-time. Plus, they will change my schedule every other day to meet their needs so I never know from day to day where I'll be working."
good,I guess everybody has to start somewhere and Publix was my starting point. This was a decent job. 
good,"This was my first job, it was part-time but a very steady-paced work environment. I made sure all customers found all of the items they were looking for, packed their groceries quickly and orderly, helped them to their cars, collected shopping carts to return them to the store, and cleaned around the registers every night."
good,Fast paced work environment where flexibility is needed to respond to the dynamics of the Customer Service experience.
good,I learn most of life less from this place.
good,The management was very cold and uninviting and didn't care about the people only themselves.
good,This company strives on culture. Very great company. Good benefits and has a good work environment.
good,"Fast paced environment, clean, safe workplace. No one is overly friendly. Most people who work there don't smile and they look tired. Very long days and early morning and late nights. Good work experience. Labor intensive."
good,"The company sounds confident in its ""Premier customer service."" But the way they treat they're employees is very selfish."
good,"Stock groceries. Not the greatest management. Good benefits in the long run, but hard to advance."
good,Everyone claims it is such a good job! yes if you are only looking for a part time job only full timers there are the managers or people who have worked there for 5+ years!
good,Worked little over 2 years with Publix and although I did enjoy helping customer and doing my job. There was little room for advancement even after being trained for everything up to a management position they decided it would be cheaper to allow me to do the extra work with no increase in pay/ or advancement. Co-workers were by far the best thing everyone is nice a friendly easy place to start working. Management was very difficult/complicated as they are always moving managers around and most people after being promoted end up getting a demotion because of an unfair accident.
good,"people are always interesting, whether you work with them, or you wait or them! As in life, you always have the good, the bad and the ugly!"
good,"At Publix my typical day is directing customers to their desired location, stocking groceries in the right location."
good,I was a fulltime worked 5 days a week 40+hrs a week . I learned how to manage my time and how to balance a task and costumers at the sametime. The management was great to get along with and co-workers where okay to work with on certain days. The hardest part of the job was having someone take care of your section when i wasnt present. The best part of the job was seeing how good of a job i was doing after each shift and happy costumers.
good,"Publix can be a good place to work, I have worked there for 16 years but I have seen it go downhill with the morale and self-esteem. There is a lot of nepotism going on and they do not take the hard workers seriously."
good,"I loved my job at Publix. However they are not understanding to like after work. IE: Family Deaths , Divorce, and Children needs. The manager  Terrier is very uncaring and she seems as if she hates her job."
good,Great company if you want to work and go home. Be friendly but avoid becoming friends with everyone. The company has changed and people will step on you to move up
good,Very good for college students with a busy schedule. Hires underage employees and gives them reasonable hours to help them out. Has tuition reimbursement to help college students.
good,management isn't to great. my managers never really showed 100 percent but excepted results out of everyone else it hard to work when we run out of supplies.
good,"publix is a great place to work if u are part time, flexible schedules and thing, but if u are full time, its a challenge, depending on what u want to do, if your full time, that means open availiablity every week unless u are a baker, dsd clerk, or seafood specialist, schedule is different every week, and dealing with the general public is challenging because people say and do whatever they want, Benefits are outstanding if u get full time,, health and dental, paid two weeks, stock options, but if u are willing to sacrfice family time, its worth it for building something towards the end. company wise its one of the best out there, but retail and dealing with the public is very challenging.."
good,"Working at Publix is ok. Most people wonder how so many workers are happy there. The truth is they aren't, its just the rules they have. The pay is AWFUL but there were some great managers and some good regular customers that made the awful pay ok."
good,"Efficient training, dedicated and loyal coworkers and a positive work atmosphere. A feeling of accomplishment each day after serving the customer's with their satisfaction being the number one priority."
good,I work over 60 hours a week and work every day no off days. Great benefits and pay but home life. I was a grocery manager for 9 years. At 5 different store.
good,Mangers will keep their word sometimes. Some managers cut hours for a thicker check in their pocket but still expect you to get the work done in a shorter amount of time. Sometimes it’s not possible.  Great benefits and flexible hours.
good,"Working here really depends on your manager. Over the summer and in high school, working here was amazing. Now in college, managers expect me to skip classes to come to work"
good,"Very easy job, co workers excellent, family atmosphere, hours per weeks varies and some weeks you could have 25 or even 30 hours and then next week drop to 4 hours week only. That’s why I decided to quit and get a better place to work with fixed hours and dates."
good,"Initial start is exciting as it is a great first job. However, management is crucial on how well you advance. It’s a hit or miss depending on the store."
good,"As a deli clerk, a typical work day is usually very busy. I've learnt to just take it one day at a time . As far as management goes, I've came across a lot of great leaders and a few unpleasant ones. The hardest of the job and when we get rude customers and busy holidays but working with phenomenal coworkers helps me get through it all."
good,"I've been at my job at Publix for five years. Off and on managers talk about making me full time but never do, An even more so lately it feels like they're trying to ice me out by giving me very little hours. Granite they're always saying I'm a hard worker who always comes to work helps customers and doesn't complain. You can count on one finger how many times I've called out. I'm actually seeing doctors right now so that I can be a better associate, but with little hours it's hard to pay medical bills. I think my store manager and department manager are incredibly wonderful people but because of my medical condition I will probably never be full-time at Publix which more than likely has something to do with the people above store management."
good,Place was relatively easy. Biggest reason I left was overnight shifts were taking too long. As a student that didn't work well. Some of the employees were lazy but managers worked hard.
good,Somebody Needs to Lower the Hours That People Need To work in a calendar year from 1500 down to Like 1300 or maybe Even 1200 Hours So they can get Health Insurance or Have Health Insurance. That would Be Real Nice For those who really need it.
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Family oriented. Very clean and organize. We following all GMP lock out and tag out. Great benefits and time off.
good,"Management needs to help with being more friendly to workers, we're in it to win it as a team, some managers don't seem to have the right attitudes, makes you wonder how they became managers in the first place; part time people hours aren't guaranteed, you are told you'll get 20-30 hours and then all of a sudden you're only getting 12-15; majority of workers are hardworking but there will be some that hold their positions by being brown nosers and you will come to see that for yourself after awhile. Pay is slacking compared to other competitors, and I'm sure it could be better. Overall 6 out of 10 score working here."
good,"Publix is an excellent first job. For career advancement there are very few opportunities besides retail management, and the few positions available are extremely competitive."
good,"Management was okay at some point, but co-worker were not care about work or Publix, in general work day are crazy not organized, some people are  not enjoy coming to work everyday."
good,Not bad for a temporary job. It was a job for me throughout college. Most people are nice and friendly. It is a good place to work and moving up is possible.
good,I enjoy working for Publix you find a lot of people who can relate to you in different way. With great opportunity's. They are willing to help with school and further your future!
good,"Very nice place to work, very easy. no hard work except for some occasional heavy lifting. Can be very busy due to the time of the year or certain holidays. The main and, pretty much only problem about the job is the amount of hours one gets. Barely 30 hours in two weeks."
good,A very stressful job and has alot of benefits if your moving up in the company to a higher position. Other than that its not fit for me. I learned alot about customer service and money managment. I also have alot experience working with others and fixing situations quickly.
good,Working was fun at first but can become stressful very quickly. Bagging requires a lot of question and communication with customers as well as helping them to the car and collecting carts. Cashiering also requires the same
good,This a great company and has many pros. The main cons is that this place becomes your whole life as you move up the ranks.  Also it is not the best for families and the leadership can be very lack.
good,Good place for a first job but not a place to seek a career. Plenty of hours to work but the pay was just not there for the tasks and time being put in.
good,I worked in Produce and was moved to bagger without my permission and then the store manager cut my hours drastically. I work less than 10 hours a week.
good,Enjoyed my experience working with the public and with different people learn a lot about the retail business great benefits and you could retire  and live comfortable
good,"Where shopping is a pleasure great deas through sale adds stocks are great investments and people work great together at Publix, safety is always major"
good,"Overall my time with Publix was good but I felt as if it was time for a change of scenary. Publix is a good place to work but it’s just not a place for me to work for the next 2 years, But I hope to work with dominoes and be delivery driver."
good,Good starter job while working in high school. I worked here while in school because they are very flexible with hours. Would not recommend for a permanent position due to the workplace culture.
good,"Working in the deli is way more work than it's worth. It's tiring, you go home smelling like cheese and meat, and you have to deal with picky customers. I'd recommend any other department over the deli"
good,"Flexible company for sure. Work can be repetitive and dull which can make morale tough within retail. Be careful about lifting, especially in stock department. Management is very up and down."
good,"For working at my previous store #1459, It was very fun in the beginning and a very vibrant work place. Once the summer time roles around, I got less hours but it was understandable, more workers. When the seasonal associates left, I expected to get my hours back, but saw a decline in my hours from minimum of 10 to around 6 or 8 per week. Not the best hours but I never complained. I sadly had to move and I requested a transfer to a store closer to my new home, but there were no openings. I disappointedly had to leave the Publix company but the staff and most of the managers were welcoming and friendly at Publix Store #1459."
good,"Fast paced environment. Management can be unorganized and lazy. work place culture is upscale and proper, Best part of the job is good pay and not very difficult work. The hardest part of the job is advancement."
good,"Publix was an okay place to work, they had paid training sessions on hours. I highly suggest working here if in high school. If you get a degree while working there they pay your tuition after you graduate."
good,Hours are very very inconsistent and management makes excuses week in and week out not all stores are like this but managers  get moved around every couple of years so no store stays the same for too too long. Brown noseing is required and there are 100% favorites. Hours are hard to get if you manager had a grudge against you. I have seen many many times a manager lie strait to an employees face in order to save them from actually telling them why they are cutting there hours behind there back or demoting them without personally informing them.
good,"I guess it depends on the store you work for sometimes, and the managers you get. its cool for a starting job but when you've there for a long time and you have more responsibilities and bills to pay and family to be with, that's another story."
good,"Great for anyone willing to work all holidays and weekends. Competitive pay and good benefits. Publix promotes from within , management opportunities are easily obtained."
good,"Publix was terrible. the manager was petty and I worked 25 hours a week and barely made over 150/week. Everybody always called out, so when you actually needed to call out, you couldn't. People always called out because they didnt like working there."
good,Company has great benefits but very stressful and demanding job. Busy work day. Hardest part of the job was just learning everything at first. Keeping up with everything in on time order.
good,Fair warning unless you are a god in what you do the chances of you leaving the deli are slim to none. Publix is a place for teenagers cause when I worked there I was younger and it was just full of old ladies with beef with each other and young kids with drama. I like shopping at Publix I would never work there again.
good,"Its a decent place to work for. Depending on what you do it pays ok. Depending on your job status you'll have set hours. If you work in customer service your hours are all over the place. You'll come in 6am one day and 2-11 the next. There's good stock, and 401k. You get dental and vision insurance after 3 months, and heath insurance when you become fulltime. There's no discounts on store purchases. They usually don't hire you fulltime you have too work your way to it. When you become fulltime you get 2 weeks vacation and you build up sick time. You never know your schedule until every Tuesday night and you then you find out what day you're off. They baby customers and let them have whatever they want be it right or wrong. They don't offer overtime but expect you to work over and cut overtime on Fridays so your exactly at 40 hours."
good,The culture is changing at Publix. The newly promoted leadership is lacking in the ability to develop and assure job satisfaction with their teams and thus morale is at an all time low with management associates
good,"It's not for everyone. Where it may not have been a good fit for me it could be for you. There are so many rude customers and the risk of getting run over getting carts is high and then having to clean bathrooms, pick up all the trash from all the trash cans all over the store and vacuum every carpets in the store all in one chore is hard on anyone"
good,The company offers great stock benefits with paid vacations. Great job security with plenty of opportunity to advance and transfer to any place there is a Publix.
good,Yea customers are king but managers their are just mean in my honest opionion. Alot of 3 hour worksl days for nothing. Cant remember much worked here since i was 17
good,"Publix is a great company, but I feel I need to grow in other aspects of life. Like a actually career that will provide longevity and have greater rewards in life."
good,This is a retail based job.  Meaning no matter what you do here it is stressful an low pay.  Not many chances to move up due to people staying in their current roles.
good,"Publix will not hire you full-time unless under a special circumstance. Wait times for management are very long in Florida, so if you are looking for a way into management, be prepared for a minimum of two-three years of hard work. The friendly environment of Publix was definitely the best part of working there. Being able to make customers happy and leave them with a smile on their face is something that is very rewarding. "
good,"Certain managers will not ""take care""of a situation like they promise they will. Publix has high expecatations that are sometimes difficult to meet. It is a fast paced environment.  You always have to be on your toes never standing still. You are expected to smile even when a customer is rude to you and that's just maturity."
good,"publix is .. bad. people are rude, very long hours standing behind a register in a uncomfortable uniform that looks ridiculous, managers blame you for little things, everything is overpriced, nothing is half priced for us employees. i was told to stop talking??? since when is it against the rules to speak to your co worker ??? i was doing my job, i was polite to customer and i was quick. so why does it bother managers so much if you converse a bit ? ugh i disliked this job."
good,Publix is the best place to work and has multiple advancement opportunities! if you would like to make a career out of this job then you're in the right place!
good,"publix culture is great, they care about their employees. always make sure you are task oriented and looking professional. Never a lack of respect in store."
good,Working at publix was a great working experience and it has shown me a lot about being an adult and living in the real world. The pay was great and I loved working their.
good,"Publix is a great company,and give good benefits for his employer.his costumer have good traitement when. I work there,i do friendship for my co-workers specially for the costomur,and do what the ask me do"
good,the work place was one of great expectation.  Fulfilled job experience with many good moments.  A caring staff and forward looking management.........
good,Good place to work great benefits i do overnight and it just fast pass and hard work and after 12 years for it take a toll on my body and the hours r gettin to me to
good,I am a dillard high school student that would love to apply for a job if any one is hiring please  contact me i would love to be working with you and customers
good,its a great place to work amazing benefits. my coworkers always are a pleasure to work with there is never a dull moment. managers are willing to work around my school life.
good,"punctuality is taken seriously, team work is encouraged. Joined"
good,"Publix is an above decent company to work for.  They provide good benefits,  and match their employees 401K program.  Publix offers retirement benefits."
good,"I am unsatisfied with the amount of hours Publix provides to it's part time workers. The scheduling is usually shorthanded and they will constantly find the need to call someone in on day off. Publix does not allow it's employees to be treat with the same courtesy of it's customers, when the employee is doing personal shopping."
good,"Very busy place, learned to multitask and work with urgency, and proficiency.  The expectations where held high for all the employees therefore we were always reaching for a goal ."
good,"I loved the enviroment and working for the location that I was employed. The staff was great and so was management. However, corporate doesn't really care about the best interest of it's employees. They'll make changes and tell you that your position is no longer available just a couple days before you're due to come to work. You're then left with going to another position that has nothing to do with what you were hired for or left with no job or hours at all."
good,You cant go more than 5 minutes without management watching your every move it made it very uncomfortable to do anything because being watched can make someone very uncomfortable
good,"Working at publix is very centered around the customers. As a customer service staff it was my job to handle any complaint in a timely professional manner. It was also my job to handle large amounts of money at a time. I had to multi tast doing multiple things at once all while keeping the customers taken care of. Management were understanding to other customer and employee issues and always kept the business in mind. The hardest part of the job was handling complaints while doing many other tasks at the same time, but the most enjoyable part was seeing customers walk away happy."
good,The Deli is Area that is often overlook but very important. Our daily interactions range from difficult to happy. The customers are nice enough yet not if that make sense. Management does not have your back ever.
good,"Cutting fruits and salads and stocking produce aisle. Flexible hours."
good,"Working starts off the same every day for the most part. I work either dry grocery or dairy. I get as much as I can to the shelf as fast as I can. Usually feel a bit overwhelmed over the weekends and the store I work at doesn't allow overtime. I only mention this as I've heard other stores in the area allow for overtime. The current grocery managers do their job with exception of the their team leader. Everyone else seems to be on top of their position."
good,"Publix is a great place to work. Most of the employees got along as if we were family, Location was good just 6 miles from my home. Would see a lot of my customers at other retail locations, and of course would check to see if there were all ok. Was saddened when I left the company."
good,"If you want to make a career with Publix, plan on working ten years before being promoted. This is a good company if you are seeking a part time position to get through school (which they reimburse you for)."
good,"The company has a culture for great customer service. I learned how to manage production and inventory. Managers are traded out every 2 years, so the job can go from very enjoyable to very disasterous, very quickly."
good,"Overall publix is a good company, with benefits and options of advancement. "
good,"Before Publix I held 6 jobs at one time, all of which were very laborious. Very quickly I earned a full time position and after just shy of two years I managed to skip up two positions in a promotion which I have held since. After my promotion I was quickly transferred to our highest volume store in the district and are currently a candidate for another promotion. My point is, I know what it takes to succeed and get ahead. I understand consumer trends and I have a great understanding of the local demographic. You'd be surprised what you learn from watching exactly what everyone around you is buying. I work hard and I'm always consistent."
good,"The money is good,but you have no life. No set schedule, Management is TERRIBLE! They have no care for employees. The benefits is awesome. This job is not for someone who has small kids."
good,I've worked at Publix for 3 years easy job and just they have bad favortism towards other employees and I feel that public has excellent benefits but they take more care of the customers than the employees and the management is great depending on the store you work at
good,job was a great job management not so much. The management was very unprofessional. I was not happy that it stated they based the company on honesty but yet some management was not honest. Some of the management was clearly not qualified either.
good,"I come to work early, then clock in on my schedule work day. I learned that multi-tasking makes the job that much easy and it usually helps me get my task for that work done quicker. The boss treated me with respect as he does to all his workers. The hardest things to do at a job is to get my work done and have to pick up another co-workers load that was left. The most enjoyable part of a work day is  to know that all your ask gets done before i leave work for that day."
good,"Working with people is difficult enough but your co workers can make things better and worse. A lot gossiping and scandals between managers and employees. I worked in the deli and I tell people to avoid working in that department. Its literally back breaking theres a lot of wear and tear on your shoulders, feet and back. only get 30 minute breaks while the front service gets an hour. most demanding department."
good,"loved my job. great people I learned a lot was on the safety team, I loved the management team  I enjoyed the work I was cross trained to do a lot of different jobs"
good,"I never stopped while working for Publix.  So much to accomplish during your eight hour shift.  I learned how to manage my time proficiently, and complete all required tasks asked of me.  My co-workers were great as well as the customers.  Learning how to manage people and handle every type of customer is what made this job so valuable."
good,"The job is a fun place to work, easy money i have pick up a lot of skills and have also meet a lot of good people, co-workers are nice and easy to get alone with. The most enjoyable part of the job is when i get off knowing that i have done a great day of work and everyone you have meet was help to the best of my ability"
good,"great place to work, weekly pay with a free lunch at your service plenty of room to move around an grow with the company, christmas bonus an two weeks worth of vacation at the start of full time employment"
good,Publix is a great company. It give employees chances to move up and have rewarding career. You meet a lot of nice people along the way. Good benefits for full timers.
good,"Cut deli meats and cheeses, make grab and go sandwiches and salads for customers."
good,I started out as a bagger and worked my way up to a produce clerk  in which I work 40 hours a week stock shelf and take care of guest and clean
good,preparing meals for everyone in assisted living. Cleaning after each meal and resetting for the next meal. Making sure the residents were getting the meal they wanted was comfortable and accomodating their needs to the best of my ability.
good,A typical day at work would be to great customers with a smile and to giver premier customer service. I learned about how to run a register and problem solving. The hardest part in my opinion would be dealing with short staff days. The most enjoyable part of the job is that everyone for the most part got along.
good,"too many chiefs not enough indians"
good,"I was very young and worked under my dad. It was a decent job, i only worked it for 2-3 days a week and didnt make very much at all. It was a good beginning job because they will hire baggers at 14 years of age."
good,Great people and atmosphere but definitely hard work is required. You learn a lot about the business and possibilities
good,Always provide great costumer service and have the skills to direct them to the right products. Be able to delegate my team in an orderly fashion.
good,"If you like working face to face with customers, then this is the place for you. Not a bad place to work, benefits are great for full-time and management."
good,"eventually get great benefits, all the people you work with are friendly, negative in my experience told i was getting promoted from part-time to seafood specialist because of my hard work and ability to run the department then being told have to wait for one to retire then they didnt retire and changed it a few months back and told i have the position but it keeps being put back for that person to retire and they wont give me full time.  bottom line if you want part time its a great fit if you want full time dont even fill out an application unless you want to wait atleast a year"
good,"awesome co workers and team players"
good,This was a great place to work. Sometimes the people would be mean who shopped there.
good,We work as a team to get the job done. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people.
good,I've been working for the company for over 8years. You have to work extra hard to get what you won't. You do not have a life when working for this company. Expecially if you are full time. Customers are very disrespectful.
good,Great friendly environment with a lot of support and great training.
good,Every day I would come in and work my hardest. But the managers at that store would come up with ridiculous excuses to not give you a raise you well deserved.
good,Its a Good company to work for just some of the people are not too good to work though pay ok but the evaluation system is pitiful
good,"Tends to short pay when it comes to fluctuating work weeks. Advanced computer skills training, customer service driven."
good,Working with this company I've learned many things I can carry on with me in life.
good,"Very minimual supervision needed when management awares of your capabilities. I order products, make decision on fish products that the dept will sell. Working in the seafood dept. has greatly educated me on all aspects of seafood and meat. Publix provides training every year on seafood products so the Specialist can better serve our customers. By gaining this knowledge it assures our customer with the comfortability of knowing the items being purchase are safe. With that our customers has learned to trust and take my advice on the products we sale, which enchances sales growth in the dept. "
good,"Work was hard. Everyday is pretty much busy, the shifts are long, the pay checks are good. All co-workers are extremely friendly and helpful. I loved that about the job."
good,"Publix is a great company to work for. Publix have been my high school job, and one of the things I do love about the company is that they always promote from within, and they want you to move up. That is one of the things I respect of the company. I made great friends that I still hang out today from Publix, and every time I shop at the store I used to work for, it is great to see the familiar faces around. The only drawback I have with the company, is the frequency they change managers, but it is understandable because that some of the managers are moving up in the chain. Publix have a great retirement plan, and even offer part-time employees in on some of the action such as stock, and a 401k. I would have stayed with the company, but retail is not really my thing... Not unless it involves computers and then were talking."
good,I loved being at the back door and seeing a different element of how the store runs.
good,"I have worked in multiple locations in the store, they are flexible in moving dept."
good,"while this was a good job and it was easy, i didn't like the management. one day i came to work early and sat at the cafe til time to clock in, i thought i would say hello to my manager, well i sure wouldn't have thought that i would have gotten yelled at openly because i forgot my belt for the first time. i don't if it's just how rude people in south Florida tend to be or that was just my experience but other than that it's probably the same stuff you'd get elsewhere."
good,was my first job after school hours. provide flexible hours to fit my schedule
good,"Bagging groceries, cashiering, custodial duties, doing stock work, leveling the store, picking up shopping carts,"
good,publix has a great working environment. It also is has great associates to help progress within the company. Great management. & always very assure that customers are well taking care of
good,I've been with the company for 15 yearsr and want something better. I feel I can't progress as fast as I want to. I'm looking for something I can be reliable for.
good,A typical day at Publix is mostly helping customers. We also have other grab and go sandwiches and salads to finish every morning. The hardest part of the job is working in kitchen or working the chicken area. I do enjoy talking with the customers and helping as much as possible
good,"Publix is altogether a pretty good place to work with a few caveats. Stock is a huge plus, and benefits including 401K are available after working past a certain threshold of hours. Full time workers are guaranteed 40 hours a week in exchange for essentially requiring open availability. People are wonderful generally speaking, and there are small events that contribute to a largely positive company culture. Pay is fair, and actually on the higher end for retail, with the pay scale continuing to increase to accommodate rising living costs. However, scheduling is inflexible around holidays to the point of it being impossible to get certain days off. Schedule only comes out a little under a week in advance, making it difficult to plan for time outside of work. Scheduling, work flow, and overall experience can vary wildly depending on management, which tends to change yearly on average. Overall I have enjoyed my time but there have definitely been both a number of highs and a number of lows."
good,"The company is not what it used to be. The new leadership is putting the top people including those who own most of the stock before the basic employee."
good,A great company. Best opportunities are for the younger people. Great part time gig.  My managers are the best there is but with my age not a big opportunity for advancement.
good,I always enjoyed working alongside my fellow employees but I always felt like the management at Publix was always looking for a way to get rid of some of us and if we did not tow the line they would terminate us at a moments notice.
good,"Publix helped me out but I think I’m"
good,Fun place to work. Stock options after a year. Good and welcoming atmosphere. sometimes the managers can pick favorites but at the end of the day if you put in the work you can advance.
good,"Working for Publix is better than working at other grocery stores just because of the stock options and benefits. Benefits have significantly decreased, however, in years past and the pay does not match the demands of the job in my opinion. I worked in the deli, considered the hardest position, and they were not flexible at all with the schedule (or with anything for that matter) and even though I was considered one of the best employees I was not paid very well. I did get a raise shortly after starting but I felt my time was worth far more than the pay."
good,I enjoy working at Publix supermarkets. I go into my job every single day determined to get the job done. As of lately it seems that management is only concerned about getting there paychecks and not making sure associates are happy have the help they need in there working environments. I spoke with my store manager about getting me help in the frozen food section and he said “You do need help.” But it’s has been three months and have yet to receive any.
good,The pay is great theirs plenty room for advancement and growth most definitely I worked with Publix as a part time associates while I was in college finishing up they are very flexible with hrs around full time or part time students or people who work other jobs definitely in Georgia when I came to Jacksonville theirs a different breed of everything
good,"For a high schooler, Publix wasn't a bad first job to have.  All they required was that you came to work on time, weren't rude to the customers or goofing off unnecessarily. Well, I can't say for all Publix but mine wasn't too bad."
good,Working at Publix was nice at first until they begin making help out in other departments. They will schedule you for another department without even asking if it’s ok. The managers are very two faced they’ll tell you one thing and act like another. I am about ready to quit after a year because they seem to care more about customers than their employees.
good,"This is a very boring job and I only liked working in the pharamacy department. It’s something I recommend becasue after working there for 2 years, I can say that there are way better places to work at with less of a boring environment."
good,"I enjoyed working for publix because of the people who worked there with me. My boss and my fellow employees were easy to work with, and always helped"
good,"Nice place to work if you're in school or you want money. reliable, flexible, job security. worked there for five years and there's nothing for me here."
good,"I was going to college for the first time and wanted to get a job while adjusting to college from high school just to be able to get some money and get a taste of the real world. I have mixed emotions on my experience at Publix. Without a doubt I'm forever grateful for Publix giving me my first ever job, and my peers helped me no matter what and most of the customers treated me kindly. However, the management and corporate side of Publix forced me to quit. I was a first time, full time college student trying to balance school and work 32 hours a week. I would constantly ask my managers to reduce my hours but it would always increase and I was working more than the adults who had families and bills to pay whereas I had nothing. Publix teaches positive and great work ethic as well as how to properly treat customers, however it could be a challenge working there if you don't have solid managers and if you hate being treated badly by mean customers and don't like feeling defenseless."
good,"The manager I work for needs better people skills. not enough hours for what I need to make."
good,"It was a good first job, but it’s gotten bad overtime with the people there. Of course some days are bad but some are good too. Be prepared for rude customers."
good,"Publix prides themselves on customer satisfaction. You're trained to make sure the customer is right 100% of the time. You direct the customer, subliminaly, to sale items and different sections of the store to maximize customer purchases."
good,"Publix offers great benefits and a flexible schedule with regular co workers that are easy to work with most of the time. It's great to start off working here and they have advancement opportunities, although you'd have to have work a long time. Depending on who your manager is, you can have a great or terrible experience."
good,"Loved working at Publix, great pay and benefits for full and part time associates. My issues only started when I went into management. I enjoyed all the relationships I built working for  this company, including meeting my husband and best friend at my place of employment. They worked with schedule requests while I was in college and always tried to accommodate the needs of a student. Just don't go into management, they have a different regard for people who take those positions and the work/home life balance is not accommodating for a single parent."
good,"A typical day at Publix consists of putting on your ""fakest"" smile just to appease the customer.  During my tenure there because I was a younger employee my opinion rarely mattered but most of the fellow employees were rude as well.  I didn't enjoy the culture at all there."
good,"Publix is a good place to work if you don't want to move up. Once you move up, your life will suck and all you will be doing is working. You will get drained out. No work/life balance."
good,"As former employee, I can vouch that this company certainly has its pros. I would highly recommend younger generations(20 and under) to invest in working here as the company has a tuition reimbursement program and is very accommodating to minors with variable schedule(though your experience by store may vary..) Overall it has room for advancement albeit to those with patience. Those looking for a fast track to higher positions will find their commitment tested. Scheduling for my store was flexible although that too will vary not only by store, but by position as well. Those working part time will find limited options in some benefits, no PTO or vacation time for part timers which is ridiculous given that some of the employees on PT can have budget issues that prevent them from taking unpaid time off indefinitely."
good,"if you are looking to advance and stay long term, this is a good job, especially for people who are young, publix loves young employees because they are more likely to work there way up, this is definitely a job where you want to move up because just working 40 hours a week with the low pay you start off at isnt gonna pay the bill and let you live comfortably, the benefits are very very good and every 200 hours you work you get a free share of stock, you're set to retire wealthy."
good,"A typical day at work was productive and always steady, management was always on top of their employees to do what needs to be done for the customers. The hardest part of the the job was to have done all you could do for a customer and they complain and still were not happy. The most enjoyment was whenever the company would send us coupons for a free item in the store"
good,"no life, its all about Publix. 12-15 hour shift if the days/ holidays are hectic. normal work day is 10 hours. If you can not work all hours of the day this isn't the job for you. it is a grocery store so keep that in my. Schedule must be open."
good,I love working for Publix but I do not get any hours. I have talked to all my managers to see if I'm doing something wrong but they say I'm a wonderful cashier and they love my high spirit. Then I later found out that Al of the cashier's get only 2-3 days for 4-7 hour shifts and that's not enough to pay bills. Then they constantly hire people. I have to work a second job to barley make ends meet
good,"find equipment do safety check and go to your department listen to the supervisor and then go to work pulling orders, management really didn't micromanage and that was nice"
good,The company is trying to hard to change the culture and push new things. it is becoming too strict and employees are beginning to notice. I would recommend to someone who wants to make it a career but be ready to work hard and put up with a lot before making some decent money (10+ years).
good,"Great benefits and some great co-workers. After the first 90 days you will have a chance to sign uo for supplemental life, eye insurance, dental insurance and 401k. You also have a chance with every 6 month review to get a raise."
good,"I have learned many things from working in Publix such as gaining patience and multitasking. Even though some hours are very long, it  is still a great work experience."
good,"Publix is by far the best company I have worked for.  Everything was going great until we started to loose business due to being in a tourist-oriented loaction. There were weeks where I worked maybe 3-8 hours every two weeks. Granted, it was the slow season and we recently had a wildfire disaster that brought the revenue for Publix and the county down than previous years. Which is understandable, but I wish they did their research more and put in a local but not to far so tourists get lost location; or at least hired seasonals, like most of the county does.(like I said, more research and understanding of the environment of the place would have been more efficient.) What made it worse is they hire new people and started to cut more hours for part timers so they can give hours to the new faces we didn't really need in the first place. But maybe their is a method to their madness. I'm only giving it a 3 out of 5 because of how short my hours were and how they hired new people but couldn't give the ones who were their for the year it's been open."
good,The typical day at publix is outgoing you meet many people. ive learned while working at publix how you can make another person life so much better by giving them a helping hand
good,"Very productive place of work"
good,"Even though I am a student, my schedule is open from Monday - Friday for my work hours. Unfortunately, those hours are not given to me. I marked my minimum as 20 hours a week yet I only receive 10-17 hours. I need the money for school but I cannot make that money off 10 hours a week."
good,"Publix is a great company to work for you have great benefits and retirement , and you also have room to grow with the company. I would still be their if I did not have a emergency and had to move."
good,Reliable and devoted people who know how to get the job done. One of the best job experiences I've had in the work field. Great for people who want to start their career in the right direction.
good,"good job. But if your not going to make a career out of it, it will start to suck. Its alll about people. If in college stay in. And don't quit."
good,publix is a nice place to work. you have a very safe and fun working environment full of great people who are polite and care about your well being :)
good,"Customers aren't always happy, or motivated. However, it was a pleasure to bring out the joy in people and aide them however possible. I learned many things about providing legendary customer service and office skills like faxing and organizing while holding my position at Publix. The hardest part of the job was staying motivated in a toxic work environment, management picked favorites and coworkers were readily active in dramatics and criticism. The most enjoyable part I would say was reaping the relaxation from a hard days work."
good,I worked on the register and help customer with their grocery. Some of the worker are nice and others are just annoying. Some of the manager are nice and others are okay. The hardest part of the job is when you have a rude customers.
good,Very good pay and benefits but the long hours and stress dealing with very rude customers having to give the store away to please them is not worth it.
good,Não cumpre com algumas coisas combinadas e nao esclarece as coisas que acontece e tem muita fofoca
good,I provide great customer service at Publix. I'm a full time fruit cutter who goes above and beyond to make sure the fruit is top quality and so forth. It's a privilege to work with such awesome coworkers and managers. The hardest part of the job is getting off on time but the most enjoyable is proving excellent customer service to the customers.
good,"Fun place to work, where everyone is treated as family. The managers were very flexible with my school schedule and my coworkers were always willing to lend a hand. The training program could use improvement; if managers are going to assign people to train other employees, they need to make sure that the employees actually know how to do their jobs well."
good,"Although I only worked at Publix for a short period of time, I can say that I am thankful for the experience, and would recommend others to work there as well."
good,"At Publix, you can expect to see a variety of potential emerge; as there is a significant amount of training available in a variety of departments. The days there can range from extremely chaotic to the point of where you're genuinely exhausted from not having anything to do. The pay is decent, and the manager's attempt to help you when plausible. Even if that does take two to three times for them to finally get it right. Management is less than exceptional, and you should expect to see frequent problems."
good,The customer service training for Publix is fantastic. We thoroughly learned to treat every customer like a guest in our home. The employers there and coworkers were like family. It was a great overall supermarket to work for at that time.
good,"basically it was a great place to work I loved the company and the core of the company the benefits were great...some of the management really stepped up and helped me when my mother died and I had to transfer...after a couple of months I had to have some time to grief a mutual leaving of the company was granted..."
good,It was a typical job at first and i enjoyed it but then I learned that it was not getting me anywhere and it began to be a dead end job due to me not being able to get a full time position.
good,Publix is sometimes a good company to work for depending on management. But other than that i give it a thumbs up. It is also a good company to move up in & make a life career.
good,"Typical day at work consist of nothing but taking carts out, bagging groceries, talking and learning about customers."
good,As I was employed for 7 years with the Publix Deli plant I noted that most the management were easy going and genuinely cared. The bond with fellow associates will last forever. I learned that not everyone is actually capable of the job ethics and production level I was used to so I learned patience and implicated easier was to get things done correctly and in a timely manner. The job is a hard one and demanding on the body and mind. After 7 years and knee surgery the cold was too much and I retired from Publix. The very best part of the job were and always will be my friends that were once my co workers.
good,"Fast paced, customer oriented atmosphere, with lots of room for advancement. Friendly co-workers who were very helpful. My day consisted of customer satisfaction and alot of money handling."
good,Publix was a great place to work. The people I worked with were very knowledgeable and kind. The people shopping in the store can be very mean at times but that is all apart of the job. I would suggest this job to anyone really needing a job or to someone who is looking for there first job.
good,Enjoyed working and producing quality product for customers
good,i enjoyed working there i had to go to school thats the reason why i quit.
good,"Helping customers too their vehicles, bagging the items correctly. Doing to nightly duty too keep the store clean.I learned how too work hard for everything, management can be a pain but they strive too push you towards success.Getting carts and cleaning up was the hardest part, satisfying a customers needs and wants felt good"
good,I work at a fast pace store that keeps you busy. Love the people I work with and most customers are regulars so that keeps it fun to know the people that you provide a service fo.
good,the day is filled with busy work from the moment you begin. you will learn to deal with different sorts of people. the management is great and very well trained. the co workers have always been extremely helpful. The hardest part was standing on you feat for 8 hours a day. the most enjoyable part was meeting new people every day.
good,"My day is based on what time I'm scheduled. Early shift means I will cut meat, latter schedule is usually an add change. I am very versatile in my work environment. My manage utilizes me in every aspect to get work complete where there other employees failed to follow through. I have learned customer service goes a long way in making customers satisfied with their purchase. My manager requires a lot more from his stronger employees to make up for the weaker employees... but doesn't evaluate by a single bar of achievement but by each individual(doesn't seem fair). Co-workers vary on knowledge and follow through and can be frustrating. The hardest part of my job is the added responsibilities without financial reward. I enjoy cutting meat, dealing with customers and making them satisfied with their purchase, and proximity to my home."
good,I was young at the time and didn't like to work but now I see that it's the best place to work that doesn't require much education .
good,"I enjoyed my 12 and a half year tenure with Publix very much. I was most pleased with this job when I was single with no family. There are very few difficult decisions I have had to make in my life and leaving this company was one of them. After I got married and had a child the amount of time I was able to spend with my new family literally disappeared. I was expected to be at work 50-55 hours a week and on call anytime I wasn't at the store. Altough, the money was great, I did not appreciate the amount of my time and life I had to sacrifice for my paycheck."
good,It job to start at but if you dont want to be dealing with customers all your life then eventually you will grow and find something better out there
good,"It was a nice place to work at but, it just was not really fit for me. The best part i liked about it was most likely the cleaning part and interacting with customers. I liked to see the smiles on their faces because of my help. Their management was very well. The co-workers were great to work with; I got along with everyone. I learned to take on responsibilities like making sure the customers are happy with the service and happy enough to come back. There were really no hard parts of the job."
good,"Publix is a great place to work and can provide some fantastic benefits, but beware if you aren't young and pretty they do discriminate against you. You have to work at least 30 or more hours a week to get benefits. I learned a lot about different people and cultures. I also learned better Math skills."
good,"A typical day at the Publix Super market included: Stocking the shelves, blocking the isles, and assisting customers as needed."
good,"Great people to work with, great family atmosphere, less than stimulating job tasks."
good,"Greeting and meeting new people as they check out at the register asking them did they find everything that they need and assistant them to there needs or wants,"
good,Kept me busy at all times but nice place to work. It was a honest job very stable just work days kept going up and down on how productivity goes that day.
good,"Customer Service, cash checks, do Western Union, answers phones, sell Lottery and do payroll, assist all associates to resolve problems."
good,Very good environment and productive company to be working for
good,"The only thing I don’t like about this company is inconsistent hours, poor management (depending on store). But, everything else I can’t complain about."
good,Good people. Not enough hours. No raises. Not a lot of room for growth. Manager was understanding when I was ill. But never treated me as well as other associates due to my Illness
good,"I was a cashier so that's what I did all day. Scanned groceries and bagged them. I learned a lot about working with others and problem solving. The management was good. My co-workers were nice but some of the customers, not so much."
good,meat cutter is a fun job i would do it if i didn't have a family. I didn't like it that when i asked for set days off i got a hard time about it and then they get upset with you and don't schedule you at all
good,You can advance quickly depending on how hard you work. Managers are able to provide feedback and help coach you to go to the next level. Great benefits.
good,Best place I worked in for years very friendly environment where employees help each other’s out and the managers are envolved in everything and have great customer service
good,Publix is a very strict place to work at and they care a lot about the customers but in my opninion they don’t  care as much about the workers unfortunately
good,Una buena empresa nos ayuda a jovenes como yo a avanzar en la vida da opportunidad a estudiar
good,"* Decent salary and good benefits (such as discounted health insurance, paid day off on birthday etc)"
good,"The department I work in is busy and I feel like management has favorite employees that get certain exemption."
good,"Publix is a great company to grow with. Great benefits, stock , good pay. Some management is very poor. A lot of workers are stuck up and bullying is quite present from time to time. Customers take advantage all the time just to get what they want."
good,During Peak Tourist Season there is a high demand to meet customer needs and to insure that they have a good experience and come back to our store. Great partnership with Boar Head product.
good,"While I would say the company values employees, and really tries to compensate well, there is some truth to favoritism in workplace and managers being somewhat in-experienced and unable to relate to the average worker bee.  While I always felt at home, wanted, and respected there, I also felt like my skills weren't used, and that the job I was wanting was constantly out of reach.  Only worked for 6 months, so may not have given enough of a chance.  Publix really is a great place to work IF you can stay on your feet for up to 12 hours.  The people will treat you like family, whether you're working there or not.  I do value the culture there, but it's slowly becoming more like its competitors in the area of too much merchandising and drive.  Expectations of employees are a bit too high, and I constantly felt pushed to do more than I physically was capable of."
good,Good nice people cool friendly trustworthy honest loyal smart crowd down to earth  how to stock well managers cool nice culture getting threw the day getting money
good,Publix was a great company to work for especially as a full time student who was a looking for a part time job. I learned many skills and the ability to work with people
good,this  was  a  fun job  very  fast   paced  also family oriented . they are flexible  with hours  its like picking your own schedule. I hated pushing carts   worst part
good,It’s a great place to work great people and managers care about your needs and if everything is alright they ask how you are and it’s wonderful the co workers are so nice
good,personally I started to not like it about a year and a half Into working there. its a lot of hours standing in one spot behind the register not being able to move. also the hours. one week you could get 25 the next week you get 10 or 8. you get every week though so that was good.
good,"I've been working there for two years and it's a fine job, just one that isn't related to my field so I don't find it very interesting, hence the 3 star overall rating. The work is pretty easy in the Customer Service and other departments aren't exactly difficult either. The Deli is the busiest place to work, and therefore the most difficult place to work. The busier the Publix, the more hours you get. If you work at a slow one like I did, be prepared for 15-20 hours a week in Customer Service. Minors can't work in most departments, so they get even less hours at a slow store."
good,"Publix takes practically anyone. Good place to work for your first job. Job environment can vary from location to location, especially when they start swapping managers around various stores."
good,Atypical day is coming in for my shift and beginning to clean and help customers with there request. I have learned how to help customers with there request. Another thing that I have learned is to learn new things needed to make sure the customer got what they needed.
good,"I had a lot of fun working at publix I met a lot of people and I enjoyed what I did at work  I love taking out groceries, stocking I would love to go back and work it's a lot of opportunities at this place"
good,Overall publix is an incredible company to work for. I've been here for five years and would recommend publix to a friend or close family member. Looking for a new experience though and a job that pays more
good,"This is a great job to have. The work is'nt hard and advancement is easy to obtain. They have very competetive pay and allow flexible work hours. However some locations may vary in many ways. For instance, depending on location, you may not get the same cultural publix experience because of bitter managers. This was not my problem but majority of my co-workers had to deal with disrepect from their managers for whatever reason. The managers in certain districts...804 south hairston...have really bad attitudes as if they basically own you as property."
good,Publix is a good job if ur starting out. But after awhile u want more freedom. The management isn't all that good. Not enough hours either I just want a job that I can enjoy.
good,Been with Publix for 10 years need to make more money  also plan on going back to school to be a EMT/firefighter Publix has had its ups and downs but I'm looking for something different to do with my career
good,It's a fun place to work I enjoy working there and working with the people I work with its like one big family it's just a great place to work for and make a career out of
good,"During a typical work day I interact with a million different customers in and out each day. All while I am interacting I love getting to know new faces but mostly I love the same familiar faces that come in everyday. I love working and interacting with people getting to know how their days are going , if I can help them with anything and just helping them with which ever it may be."
good,"Fun atmosphere and their is room for growth. Although if you do want to grow in the company you have to start at the very bottom of the food chain and it take a LONG time to get to the ""top""."
good,I'll admit it is kinda a fun company to work with i love working with some of my associates others not so much but then the Management at Publix is just terrible in my opinion they barely give me hours when I was hired guaranteed at least 25+ a week now im lucky if I get 20+ last couple of weeks gone anywhere from 15-19 hrs a week.
good,"I would come in and start helping out the cashier before i became on i started as a bag boy."
good,"very fast paced with everyday being a new start to something different, good place to start at if your still going through high school."
good,"Industrial Maintenance dept. Not a good dept. for advancement unless you're in the in crowd. Fake talk and empty promises that don't pan out. Overall a very good place to work, untill you interact with manegement."
good,Work was never the same each day. it was always filled with different customers and great stories and conversations. I learned how to satisfy customer needs and how to work great under pressure.
good,"A typical day at work was usually the same for me, I would usually switch between bagging the products and carry them out with the customer, or work as a cashier."
good,"I was a Customer Service Associate; bagging groceries, attending the customers needs, taking out the carts to the parking lot and emptying the groceries, organizing convenient stands, and keeping a clean environment wherever I went. It was an OK place to work, everyone was friendly and when I would bag groceries it was a great way to meet new people and gain connections to different businesses and opportunities. "
good,"A typical day at work for me was handling the stores money such as lotto,cashing checks,western unions and 9 tils. Iloved doing western unions because i was actually doing work persay instead of dealing with a register. If i could do them all day i would volunteer. I learned alot of money skills for a near future job. I loved my co-workers and it was never a dull moment. Management just come and go but i had two managers in paticular who pushed me hard enough to be where i was at and without them i feel like i would not have learned a thing.  Most enjoyable part was interacting with my customers , made a few friendships with them and even some would special request me. It was a great feeling."
good,I work between to departments. Cashiering/customer service and produce to cut fruit when needed. Its a great company and there always busy and that's what l love best.
good,"Provides stress free work environment. Work one day from home each week."
good,"Work started out by collecting all of the carts from outside rain or shine and jumping on a register line to help bag on the day i wasn't cashiering. I also helped answer customer questions such as item locations and advertisements. I learned how to provide helpful questions to customers in a friendly manner while assisting them with any other needs such as putting their groceries in there car and providing them with an umbrella while it was raining. Management was pretty awesome though. If it was a really busy day, they never minded putting down paper work to help their departments out. The hardest part of the job was trying to communicate with other co-workers seeing as how we didn't have talkies. So there was constant running around. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people who work around you. Always friendly, professional, and they always have your back."
good,"friendly  customers"
good,graet job just not a lot of hrs and the people is okay to work with
good,"on Wednesday a busy day ,I learned that the team work makes it easy to manage time ,gets every thing in order ,and keep the business going well ,it was fun working at a good environment every body helping and every body satisfied"
good,"Publix is a good company to work for, you could easily work your way up the ladder. its also a great job if you are in high school"
good,"This was my first job growing up, its a great company to start for but I couldn't imagine living my whole life working for Publix.  I feel like its a great starter job as it starts hiring at the age of 15 I believe."
good,I loved working for Publix the only reason I left was due to the fact my stepfather had a double lung transplant and I quit to help him out.
good,All associates know is how to treat customers with respect and with dignity which helps perform their job efficiently. Most or all associates have tasks and chores to do before their shift ends (if working until close).
good,"All-in-all, Publix Supermarkets Inc. is an excellent company to work for offering competitive pay, outstanding benefits, and tremendous growth opportunity to its employees. The only problem it has, like any retailer, is that the demanding work schedule make it difficult to achieve a healthy work/life balance. Unfortunately, the is a major drawback."
good,"During the three years that I worked for Publix company, I accomplished most of my goals there and felt really comfortable duing my job. I started with $6.25 an hour and I was incresed salary every so often according with my periodical review. After a year of working as a grocery cashier, I requested promotion to the pharmacy that later on I was granted and I end up with a salary of $9.25 an hour. By the time I left the company, approximately 30% of my salary was increased since I started. I did all that in five years and I enjoyed working for them. I left due to a change of carrier. Later on, due to my daughter sudden sickness I dedicated my self to her recovery."
good,Really only a good job if you are a minor or just plan to stay with the company as a temporary job. I say this because the pay is pretty much bare minimum.
good,Was very nice to work with the team..but I was yuong.and I need a jod the is going to paid me enough to paid my bills..but for young kids looking for jods this is the company to work for.
good,"It wasn't that enjoyable. I got a pay-check of course, but the job was boring and repetitive. Perhaps it felt like it was a downgrade from my previous job at the county."
good,"Great place to work especially as a first job, which it was for me. I have been offered management opportunities so there is lots of opportunities for advancement it just wasn’t for me"
good,"Great job to start off but pay wasn’t the best. Was my first job. It’s a nice clean environment. It’s hard to get more hours if you want more hours, I was only part time."
good,"Work culture is good, as for starters, you start off as part time, giving you about 15 hours per week, they usually give you an hour break which is a lot for part timers. Their policy is really strict."
good,"This is an excellent job if you need security and  sure job that you cant get fired from. It is a good high school job, unless you want to further your career. I'd say the only downside about publix is pay and the fact that hours always poorly fluctuate."
good,I was a full time cake decorator and loved the art work and imagination that customers allowed me to use. I worked with great managers and team mates.
good,Challenging & engaging work place that's clean and very professional.  Great customers and effective managers.  Most days started at 6:00 a.m. and ended at 5:00p.m - 7:00p.m.
good,Publix is a company for many opportunities of growth.  I enjoyed and was able to witness first hand the treatment towards the employees as well as the costumers.
good,Publix is a great company for students or those that have a second source of income. Pay is a bit higher than our competitors. bi annual treviews and bad
good,"Most of the positions are straightforward, not challenging.  I gained some insight into human nature when interacting with customers."
good,"Publix isn't a bad company, but in my store it's absolute chaos. They have great benfits but it's becoming more to me that it isn't the job for me. But over all it's a great place to work benifit wise."
good,"Great company, with awesome supervisors ans staff. Loved all the benefits, would def go back. Loved everythig about this company but had to move out of state."
good,Great Company. If our thinking about management get ready to wait. Great place to work for while in school. They take longer then other companies to promote. Great job to start and learn a good work ethic.
good,Working at Publix Supermarkets for a year allowed me to increase my skills in customer service and learn the precautions to take during safety issues that must be addressed. I also experienced a loving atmosphere and have built relationships with many customers as well. The hardest part of the job would be to advance from part time to full time employment.
good,"I clock in and I am running till it is time to clock back out. I start the floor, that consists of three cooler cases and one table. Pulling the product that is needed for that day. The items that did not get produced will have to be produced to go on the floor. This will slow down your whole morning. Then as you are doing this you must check the cake orders for the day to see the earliest time so that you can strategize how to get them done in between filling the floor. Then once you have the floor finished you have to begin the production sheet for that day. This is how your whole day goes along with customers coming to buy product, ask you bakery questions, order wedding cakes, and walk in orders. The managers wanting to know why the floor is not filled when you had it filled but you are so busy you haven't had time to go and recheck it. Whoa it is a lot."
good,"Publix is a great place to get one started in the work field, or for retiries to fill in some income. They always work with your personal schedule, allowing to have week days off and able to work on the weekend and still maintain 40 hour weeks."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me waiting on customers, providing their cold cuts in a timely manner. maintaining a clean work environment, stocking, making platters, and breaking down and cleaning the kitchen. I learned how to prepare foods and excellent customer service. The hardest part of the job was staying clean, but the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and my amazing coworkers."
good,This is the 3rd time I have worked at Publix which is very rare. I love the environment but my only problem is when it comes to promotions. I have gotten the run around alot.
good,"a typical day at work consists of day to day operations such as customer service, pack out (packaging baked goods/bread slicing and bagging). also, cleaning whenever you finish up after the day ends. meaning washing the floors, counters, and other duties. I recommend getting along with who you work with. It makes a world of difference when you have great people to work around. In my experience, having a great coworkers makes a world of difference. Departments have difference work loads with similar pay *part time* (from my experience). I recommend finding what that is and not work harder for the same amount of pay."
good,"Working at Publix isn't bad, but I'd feel better about it with a higher pay. As a customer service staff, depending on your willingness to learn, you are faced with a lot of different responsibilities that could even be manager level."
good,Publix was my first job when I turned 16 and I would recommend this as a first job to anyone. They are very friendly and warming as they welcome you into the publix family. The training is fun and short.
good,"not a bad place to work at all, but it definitely takes a special type of person to work there. if you're willing to put in the hours you can really benefit from working here."
good,"Good place to work but they don't give enough hours and is hard to work in the deli . If you are allergic I don't recommend Publix , you have to work with chemicals"
good,"Fast paced environment, great employees . You will love what you do just a few people have sour attitudes if you can get passed that then everything else will be fine .. managers are always open to listen but not help make situation better . But working for this company theirs so many different positions and possibilities for you"
good,a typical day at work involved lots of physical work and attendance to customers
good,"Early morning hours are spent baking off all the fresh items needed for opening hours."
good,Fast pace work environment. Compensation was great for a first job. Job advancement was slow but worth the wait.
good,"Different hours and days"
good,The employees that I worked with were nice and courtious. The managers were sometimes hard to get along with. I enjoyed working for Publix most of the time. The pay was fair.
good,"Working at Publix consisted of clocking in on the dot, reviewing my work plan for the day, and then executing it. Since Publix is very much about The Customer is Always Right, my job title filled in all the holes of customers' needs: whether it was bagging their cashing their checks, distributing money orders, checking out their groceries, bagging their groceries, walking them to their cars, closing, and janitorial work."
good,some of the management work there help for too many hours in a row
good,"I love the work environment at Publix; everyone is friendly and helpful, and coworkers are very cooperative. The pay is great for such a common job, and I have learned a lot about customer service with my experience at Publix. The only complaint I have about Publix is how difficult it is to get sufficient work hours as a front service clerk. I typically receive less than 9 hours a week when my preference is 10-15h per week."
good,"Publix use to be a great place to work but in that last few years, corporate has made some less than helpful changes and many people are either quitting or do early retirement"
good,"job was easy , coworkers are nice , management could be better , hated getting carts , good break times ,bagging was good, it was good overall and i recommend it"
good,"I loved working for this company I was able to be a helping hand. the work her was very easy once I got the hang of it, it took energy each day I worked."
good,I loved working for Publix because of the environment I was in. They are extremely motivational and my managers did not label us as lower staff. Publix is a family ambience with no negative competition. I disliked the fact that some managers had favoritism but we are all human so it was accountable but not completely wrong. If you would like to go up in this company you would need to work more than breathe to show grit but that's normal also. It's a perfect starter's job because it is necessary for people's true colors to show. No interference of personalities and everyone is extremely nice.
good,I have great co-workers & supervisor you receive stock & other great benefits
good,"A typical day at Publix is usually busy mostly in the evenings. Since Publix was my first job I learned all of my Customer Service skills from working here first. It taught me how to work under pressure when deadlines are due, how to deal with angry customers when a product may not be in stock. Taking customers out after their order is done. Cashiering, which was alot of fun because I enjoyed ringing up orders. Management was so helpful and dependable because whenever a complaint was out of the employees reach the managers was always there to fix the problem. Co-workers were very patient in training you to the best of their knowledge about the store and the position in which you were hired for. The hardest part of the job was pushing the carts back in the store in the hot sun. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customer's."
good,Publix use to be the great and caring company you could call your second family. A company that George Jenkins could be proud of. Now the only concern they have is profit. They do not care about their employees or their families. They put on a show for the public and media and behind closed doors cut back hours and tell their employees they are liabilities for having kids.
good,"I was extremely proud to be selected to work for Publix. Unfortunately I was misinformed about my position. I was under the impression that you could advance quickly and if you were not happy with your department you could be moved. I was also under the impression I was hired as a full time associate, however I worked less than 20 hours most weeks. The pay did not commensurate with my experience. Lastly the management is highly unqualified too hold their current positions. Publix could be one of the best companies to work for but they treat the customers better than the employees. I put customer service first and foremost but I also believe that the employees should receive the same treatment."
good,"Lugar ótimo de se trabalhar, com pessoas incríveis e dispostas a ajudar sempre."
good,I learned that not all people work the same or have the same work ethic. I also learned that people where given more opportunities than others are given.
good,"if a customer threatens an employee . The customer should be held accountable for they actions, not  the employee being terminated. I had a bad experience with management & customer relations at this company. It is good to shop there & work there, but at certain locations managers favorites are giving promotions and benifits."
good,"Very productive "
good,Ready to leave. If they are unhappy the give bad hours or no hours and are not respectful of anyine. I hate going to work because I never know what the day holds. My manager may ignore me or hug me!
good,"I spent years trying to move up in the deli and then again in customer service, and again in meat department. During the 7 years I worked there I had dipped my toe into every department and each one said the same thing. You'll do it you'll get there, but no proof to follow through. I've known people there for 15+ years and haven't even been glanced at for management. "
good,"It was to fast paced and stressful. I wasnt 100%sure how to make the sandwiches and it was never really explained to me. If it was explained it was in a quick ""you should know this manner""."
good,"The pharmacy would be consistently busy and for a 5-9 hour shift you would work stations, rotating every two hours. Normally, there weren't breaks or lunches unless you wanted to take one, but then your time would be cut."
good,"It was very difficult to work for this company and have a good family home life. They want you available to them any time, forget it if you have children that need time."
good,"Honestly, i have only been working at Publix for almost three months and i can truly say the managers suck, they promise flexible schedule but give you the weirdest, most off-the-wall times ever. They've had me come in for a 2 hour shift, take three days off, then work me a 10 hour day. I told them upon the day i got hired that i needed 30+ hours a week, holidays off, and morning shift. that is all..... i have worked ONE morning shift in the since i started. i have only worked closing / night shift. If i would've known this would happen from the start i would've worked else where. I got no training and was forced to train two people just on my second week there. Also i have only gotten about 15 hours a week on average. i have taken peoples shift, never late, came in if someone called out, and did my job correctly YET i am still not a cashier almost three months later. When i brought it to the managers attention i was ignored. They ordered me a new shirt and neglected to give it to me up until last weeks even though i asked multiple times a day for it. Because of all this i was forced to get a second job to make ends meet. The only reason i would recommend Publix to someone is because its a good first job if you're young, and/ in school. Also i doubt most of the stores are as bad as mine."
good,"Ehh I worked here for almost two years and was cross trained in just about every department. It was good until what i call ""the great shift"" happened and all of our new managers didn't seem to understand that their employees are still human beings and they are not capable of doing  several different things at one."
good,Hours are all over the place. No set shift. Never know how many hour you will get some weeks you get ten some weeks 38. All and all Publix is great. Just hard to judge what kind of hours you will get.
good,"Very multicultural with young as well as elder workers which is good. I work the front-end and my goal was to move to HR since Publix hires from within. I bag groceries, clean floors and toilets but opportunities just don't seem to be there. Most of the management have been there 10 years or longer. The good percs is that you are allowed to set your own schedule and generally you come to work and do your job and go home with little supervision. The bad percs as indicated is that job advancement is not too good. The pay sucks and there is virtually no benefits. I am told that more opportunities exists once you have been there for a year. At the end of the day my feet and legs are killing me. I downloaded a step tracker app to my phone and from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. I took 10,664 steps during an active time of 2 hours and 46 minutes, because when you are standing still at the cashiers lane you really aren't taking any steps. I wore out two pairs of skechers FROM INSIDE THE SHOES. Go into any Publix and you will not find any associate sitting. It is all about standing and walking ALLDAY."
good,"Publix itself is a great place to work but for the limited hours given  work at the particular work place, lot of hours promised and you never too much know what your schedule may be and working hard only lead to working for everyone else fulltime as they are out but hours drop as they come back"
good,"I enjoyed working at Publix but the Deli manager was a mean, hateful, unbearable person and ultimately the reason I quit my job. I loved the store managers and the employees throughout the store. The customers were great. I really twish that store managers could have done something about the deli manager because I hated to leave my job of almost 5 years"
good,"Excellent customer service, great for teenagers as their first job teaches very good work ethic and skills to be able to go to their career jobs. And to be able to move up into the company to actually make good money and have the ability to support a family in the higher up positions just a regular worker is good for someone who doesn't have a family to support."
good,They work hard on pride in having long term employees that understand what it is to be a part of the publix family. As a part timer in the bakery and in customer service it became stressful and annoying to fight for hours as a bagger and even more irritating to have my hours cut in the bakery.
good,"I have worked with Publix for almost 11 years now and needless to say the company has changed Immensely. Their is no work/life balance nor compassion for the associates life needs. The company only looks out for it’s self. A.k.a “business needs”. Benefits are depleting, which was a major selling point for Publix."
good,"we have good day. we have to learn about seafood and all the kinds "
good,"Lack of training, managers demoralizing employees, push to breaking point... Taking away some of benefists for employees and so many full time employees who have 3 + year with Publix ""WHAT IS PUBLIX DIRECTION""...."
good,"managers are terrible. no one helps each other at all. the deli department was a war zone. you never have the materiel. or the staff, or anything to fully serve the customer"
good,"its was a lot of work, physical work I mean. The coworkers didn't act professional a work like I am trained to do by the military."
good,"Good people, but horrible management while I was there. Got pulled back in to the office to get yelled at because I complained about a 30 minute shift. Would work there again, but not at the same store."
good,Publix has great customers but management changes so often that procedures change with each new manager. One week you will get 24-26 hours then the next week 10. If you take a day off they punish you the next week with no hours. If you are sick you have to have a doctors note for each day you are sick so there is more pay out of your pocket!!!!
good,"The company promotes an employee focused philosophy, but does not maintain that philosophy in actuality. The expectation of management is that they are available 24/7. There is no work/life balance at all. Vacations have been cut short and new parents are forced to cut their leave short due to “business needs”. Instead of building up struggling associates, management is encouraged to hire new staff to replace them. Additionally, they have implemented a hiring strategy to hire minors to indoctrinate them innto Publix culture to make them believe there is no better company than Publix."
good,"If you dont fit into the managers click, they will not give you hours and they will slowly push you out the door. They will write you up for the smallest things like forgetting to clean out a bread box."
good,It was a very family oriented work place where they cared about not only the job but you and your family as well.Publix has premier customer service and quality products. Everyone associate is nice and dedicated
good,"Good high school job, difficult to move up and keep soul intact."
good,It’s a very stressful work environment but it’s not a hard job. But the management in the deli are awful. That makes the job hard. I love my job but my hours are not consistent and the managers don’t care about your home life
good,"Cashier with excellent customer service. Don't like to promote the older employee's. You must start young and work your way up. The younger employees will get promoted before the older employees, even if you have the experience. I am very lucky to get my foot into the door. Very hard to get full-time employment."
good,"•Perform night-shift closer duties, including cleaning and sanitizing work area and counting till in order for work space to be ready for day-shift. Maintain shelf inventory and overall organization throughout entire shift. Provide customer service and care at checkout"
good,Work hours suck if you do not have an open availability. The job is mind numbing. The environment is okay but the job is boring and not worth the pay and hours.
good,Publix was a very hostile place to work. They are not very tolerant of other people's cultures. Publix does not accept different religions people of different religions are treated differently.
good,"It was an okay workplace, just management wasn't all that great. Didn't let people who should move up to do so. But loved everyone I worked with."
good,"Ability to cater to customers needs, specially if you are a people person, Management needs refocused on founders vision, co-workers could have better sense of team work, training could be more available and encouraged."
good,"I was a multi-tool of the store, spending time across departments. I was responsible for inventory management, store appearance, safety procedures, team management/mentoring, and always great customer service. Extra tasks were regularly delegated to me. As with most organizations, there were great people to work with/for and there were not so great people to work with/for."
good,My goal is to make everyone feel like they have left with a gratitude of shopping in this establishment. what I have learned is how to accomplish the time in the clean-up in the time given. also the length of time it takes to serve your customer and still manage the satisifaction of the customer. I do find it hard to have a co-worker constantly complaining about their job. It's hard to keep smiling at times when you have a co-worker who is constantly complaining.I ignore the negative comments and concentrate on serving the customer to the best I can.
good,"I liked my job in the bakery. When I was hired I was looking for full time. I was hired as part time but told I would work full time hours most of the time. I had good hours for the first month, then the hours started getting less and less. I was averaging about 12-15 hours per week, They kept hiring more part time people so they didn't have to give benefits and giving everyone less hours."
good,Overall a great place to work. Management was always lacking though. Corporate doesnt really care about it workers. Customers have become spoiled and are allowed to treat employees how they want.
good,"Publix is a wonderful company to work for. It was an honor to work for tem for the last 3 years. Coworkers were fairly kind, management was poor. I decided to resign from Publix and find something new. Something that I can advance in, something that will motivate me to keep going, and somewhere I feel welcomed."
good,"Typical day at work consists of unloading truck by yourself and not getting any help, yes it's fun when you all talk together in the back room or help eachother out on the sales floor but if you work a side department you receive no help."
good,Publix as a company is not a a bad place to work. Hourly employees are treated much better than management. No work life balance at all in management positions and extreme stress levels are the normal way of life.
good,It was ok to work at publix. Just wish it was more lead way to move up or make more money. Overall it’s all what you make it and I feel I could have did more then what I was given.
good,"Long hard days.Always changing guide lines."
good,"Depending on the location your choose. I worked in Gwinnett and it was very racist. Managers would never give hours to certain race. A typical day was being on your feet all day I learned pretty much of everything but you have to ask and want to learn they have not problem giving you what you need to succeed. The hardest part of the day is when you worked all day running around the store and cashiering, collecting,baskets in the parking lot and you have to close and clean up the entire store. I felt a cleaning service should of been hired for that. The most enjoyable part was the customers and learning how to use those coupons I never had to get off work fight through traffic and grocery shop later."
good,Everything about my job was great. I loved my job. Work hours were crazy so wouldn’t be recommended for a very family oriented person. we just had for management throughout the whole warehouse
good,"Work was okay. The days went by fast, the work was easy. Every day I would come in at 5:45am and look at the job list of things to do. After locating what needed to be done fist, I would get a team together and start the work"
good,"Publix is a good company to work for for a first time job. Although my experience the last year at Publix was not a good one, I do not hold that against the company itself."
good,"It is a fast paced, uptight environment. Also some of the management  are prone to unfair judgement and slow in assistance of subordinate personnel seeking to transfer departments because said individual realize they needed to try something different."
good,publix is a great job if u need a second job for some extra hours or if youre going to school and u need a set schedule and all that theyre are very linent on that and support it.
good,great company to work for but if you are at the wrong store it can be hard to move up and advance. i have been at the same store for 5 years and the management has been horrible.
good,I was a bagger for a year. Fast paced for the most part. Good to have as a first job. Nothing special. I started off earning $8.25 and after a year of working there I received one 25 cent raise.
good,Using the meat slicer was fun other than cleaning and cooking subs and other hot items it was very relaxed. It was a job that's all about customer service based making the shopper happy.
good,"Publix was a great place to work while I was in school. The hours were flexible, and they really helped work around my busy schedule in college. The work was always fast pace and you stayed busy the whole day. To work here though, you need to learn and have people skills."
good,"OPEN THE BAKERY GET MY DAILY TASK STARTED BE PRODUCTIVE AND WORK IN A TIMELY MANNER TO GET ALL MY WORK TASK DONE AND COMPLETED ON TIME "
good,"I have always felt Publix was an awesome company. My advice is to be careful of your location. My relocation to the Charlotte Division has been horrible. The management here is horrible compared to Publix everywhere else. Management would be considered bullies, condescending, and not approachable. Management constantly threatens your job security. This is not the Publix way. Normally I would recommend Publix and still do as far as pharmacy is concerned stay away from the Charlotte division."
good,Publix is a great company but it is more for teenagers in high school. I did not like that they gave me so many hours for only being part time and then when I had asked for a schedule change they gave me 1 day of work a week and that is not fair. Not willing to work with you or your schedule unless you're in high school. Managers played favorites.
good,"Publix was a great place to start working. Great group of people but had to move on once I graduated college. They do provide room for advancement, you are just waiting quite some time for this to happen."
good,Okay place to work part time other then that it is not a great  path
good,Great associates to work with who all were on board with training to upgrade our team abilities ...working with and for others
good,"long shifts, odd break schedules, low pay. if ur not a department manager you virtualy make no money."
good,"Typically, I work 35 hours a week. I cashier and package groceries throughout my shift until the end and then clean the store before I leave for the day. Overall, Pubix is a great place to work if you're seeking to move up to management after a few years as well as if you need a flexible schedule due to personal and professional reasons. The most enjoyable part of my job is putting a smile on customers' faces. The hardest part of my job is at the end of my shift when management doesn't take a step forward to make sure everything is alright before the shift ends for every co-worker's responsibility,therefore, we end up staying longer due to other people's procrastination."
good,"Pay very well!"
good,"I been with the company for almost a decade and haven’t been able to get full time. I’m at a place in life where is necessary for me to have a full time job, where the weekly hours I get are secured and sure. Im not looking to jump from job to job."
good,I really enjoy my job just wish the hours was more flexible. The managers try to work with you but if you not open then you don't get any hours pretty much.
good,"Always gave lunches for their employees every other month"
good,"Must be a hard worker. Don’t be late or miss any days.                                                     It’s very hot, unless you go to a refrigerated warehouse."
good,"The store is cleand and the customers and co-workers were Great.Management is out of touch with employees and are not at all concerned with well being of staff. If you hire in at part time be prepared to work full time hours with NO benefits and people that want full time struggle to get it??Crazy, I only wanted to work part time but was working 10, 11 hour shifts and sometimes without a break for 7 hours too much!!"
good,Not a bad place to work just be on your toes and watch what you say because at any time you can get in trouble if a customer hears a private conversation and doesn't like it. Because if they complain your management won't back you up.
good,"They will definitely hire new people with less experience and give them a higher hourly rate. Full time benefits are great, part-time. . . not so much. There is very little training, so better for the self motivated."
good,The job environment was based on how fast you performed your job duties.  There were at least 2.5 accidents a week and poor communication between co-workers.
good,"Publix was a good company, the employees were nice, but there was a few issues with if something happened with family they wouldn’t help you out and let you go handle the situation, I had one manager let me take 2 weeks off for a family members death. That was the only nice thing I really remember, other then that, a few managers were pretty nice."
good,Basic day to day was very simple but the problem was management not being more active with their employees.  New recruits would be hired but not trained properly and would become lazy almost a month into their job.  I learned how to manage stressful situations and how to lead a group of employees for night chores.  Another problem was the pay.  We would not get paid enough for our hard work when picking up the slack in other departments.
good,"Fast paced days. Dealing with customers of all kinds and with all attitudes. Same with co workers, of course."
good,They gave us good hours but we would often work more than we were supposed to because people would quit or call out with no punishment. Managers were also never punished and often the people under them would be punished instead.
good,The work environment is relaxed but fast paced. The management is usually okay. Moving up in the company is very hard and they pay is very low for the standard of living.
good,"The job was stressful due to the customers and their attitude. My problem was that I cared and I like to see my department neat. Unfortunately, I was overworked due to staff shortage."
good,"I think things work differently at my store. My manager is months behind on giving six month evaluations and raises. Don't expect to get properly trained for anything, and in my region, expect the minimum required pay raises regardless of performance."
good,Great place to work especially for college students because the hours are flexible. Has a friendly and family orientated environment. Great customer service
good,"I was making little pay, so I requested a raise which I got a small raise and then they cut my hours."
good,It’s a good company to work for when starting in the work force and for students without restrictions. They offer benefits to full time associates and partime associates with a certain amount of hours worked per year.
good,"I really like working at publix but you will have to sacrifice your personal life for this job. I work in the Deli and it is very stress, watch out for the people who just go in and wait for their check and dont do anything."
good,Inconsistent and unpredictable part-time hours. Management unreliable and self-serving. Co-workers supportive and helpful. Positive team environment. Opportunities for advancement limited.
good,"They pay a little bit over minimum wage, and raises are generally anywhere from 0-$.50 every six months. Your hard work WILL go unnoticed, however, and they refuse to train you in new skills. Everyone joins because they hear about how many advancement opportunities there are and how incredible the benefits are and how you can get rich on the stocks here. Not true. They don't need or want people who are ready to go all in and move up the chain- they need worker bees who will follow orders until they die or quit. The benefits are competitive, but they guard their full time positions tighter than Fort Knox. There are many people who got VERY rich off the stocks when the company was growing, but since they split the stocks and received a new CEO, the stock has been essentially worthless and trying to earn them is a 3-year process of jumping through hoops."
good,"Publix Supermarket was my first job. As a 16 year old, it was nice to see what it is like to work for what you want and reward yourself accordingly. As I said, it was a good first job."
good,"It is a great place to work, but it is extremely controlled. The consistent tests and always being subject to random tests makes it almost anxiety ridden. They never over staff, always under."
good,My manager was very kind. He always set aside time to talk if there were any concerns. The work was hard but for an entry level job the pay ($10.50 /hr) wasn't too bad I thought. You also have to help customers while out on the floor stocking the shelves. The customers really appreciate the help they get and feels really good to help someone find what they need quickly and accurately. What I miss most about this job was helping others.
good,"Typical day would be helping customers of course making production in the morning for lunch and cleaning, cleaning,cleaning. Publix was a very cleanly environment i would always eat anything made fresh from the deli/bakery because of it. "
good,"Publix taught me how to be everyone's dream employee. Through many different training courses, the company ensures that all employees have a dedicated and can-do attitude daily."
good,Love working for publix. Enjoy connecting with customers and upholding responsibility. Typical work da consisted of preparing cooked food and slicing deli meat for customers.
good,I love being a cashier. I love talking with all thr customers. i hate how i am treated by management and their style is s***. get it together publix....
good,"A typical day of work for me included clocking in, serving customers, talking to customers, helping customers, cleaning, and clocking out. I learned very useful conversations skills and how to prioritize my work to make as many people happy as possible. The management was probably the toughest part of the job, they were very unorganized and disrespectful, but I just reminded myself that I was there for the customers and just to get through it one day at a time. My co-workers and I got along very well, I made some life long friends in just a short amount of time and I would not change it for the world. The hardest part was realizing no matter how hard you try, not everyone will be happy. There are some people who just will not let happiness happen, and that's okay. The most enjoyable part was when the regulars would come in and we would chat and catch up while I did my work, it made it feel less like a job, and more like catching up with old friends, which I loved."
good,"great people, great deli food, hard to get a full time position though."
good,A great place to work especially if management is kind friendly and understanding of life situations. Very clean and organized working environment.
good,"The hours were difficult as they changed daily and weekly.  I loved my colleagues and had a great relationship with them."
good,It is a work environment that needs managerial improvement. The managers in my department never agreed on anything. One manager always over rode the other. There was no balance. The workers in the department were not treated the same way either. Over all the customers were amazing and somewhat understanding when it came to rush hour around their lunch breaks.
good,"Each day is very similar. Whether I am assigned to work in Seafood or Meat I know I will need to take care of both sides at any time.Rarely is there a slow day as I have learned our store is tracking much higher growth than any other store in the region. From unloading pallets 4 days a week, managing the meat case assuring 100% customer contacts when out front on the case. Seafood and Meat require constant attention to the display and the seafood case requires much higher attention. Whether opening or closing there is always a list of work I must get done."
good,"•	Head meat Cutter"
good,"Scanning customers purchases. Greeting and helping them. Keep the store nice, clean and safe for everybody. Management is nice and efficient. The coworkers are easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is not getting enough hours. The nice part of the job is making new friends/acquaintances everyday."
good,Very busy and productive. My co-workers are sweet and lovable. Not meeting the customers needs is the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting the customers.
good,"I worked here for a little while before pursuing better opportunities, management was love and hate especially, i was a low level stock clerk so everything in grocery was my fault regardless of if i just arrived or had just got off. Benefits were never offered to me even tho i worked well over the minimum amount of time required to receive them, i often worked 40 hour weeks to only be considered part time and you are NOT allowed overtime so if you hit 40 you clock out and they wont upfront tell you but they expect you to work off the clock in secrecy so everything is ""perfect"" overall i wouldnt recommend anyone ever being a stock clerk for them"
good,"Set work each day in block segments of time, with adequate training. Everything I know about computers I learned with this company as their programs were specialized for their needs and changed several times through out the 14 years I worked there. Routing was the most difficult task in the broad spectrum based on product quantities in trailers based on length. I particularly enjoyed the freedom to work unsupervised throughout the majority of my employment. Most of the my co-workers were proficient in their abilities, but did not always display a committed work ethic. Management appeared to be somewhat off base with favoritism in the office and limiting of other management officials."
good,"Hard to have a balance of life and work while working here full-time. Publix definitely has its pros and cons. A pro being that most managers here in my experience are nice, however this isn’t the case for all. Some will treat you like gum on the bottom of their shoe."
good,Publix is a great place to work. The culture is family and customer friendly. They hire young people with lots of energy. Management is supportive and attentive to the needs of employees.
good,"I learned the proper way to bag grocery items and to greet customers the proper way. Their pay was more than minimum wage which is good, the most enjoyable part of this job was the nice customers getting to meet new people."
good,It’s hard to advance within the job because they pick and choose who they want to promote instead of giving other people who’s really interested in advancement which is really messed up..if they like you they’ll promote you simple as that..everyone who’s left Publix says it’s the best thing they ever done so now I see why..oh yea you get written up for everything too...
good,Publix is a great company. But I left Publix because of the management was terrible. They would not help with anything and my store was not organized at all.
good,Was once a great place to work and a place I wanted to work the rest of my career.  The company changing over time has made it unbearable for a lot of people.  It’s not a people’s first company like it was for most of the company’s life.  Extremely high stress.
good,"The hours working at publix in the grocery side is sometimes unpredictable. The hours are all over the place. Yes the benefits are great but for me that wasn't enough, specially with a new family started. I wanted to be home with them more often and not work different hours every other week."
good,"Good place to work for someone who doesn’t have a better option . "
good,"Decent company but very difficult to live on the income earned. Lowest paying job I have had in many, many years.  Must be physically capable of hard work that is consistent. Must be able to learn tasks that require thought and genuine care. Must be people-oriented and extremely flexible. Must maintain hours to keep benefits."
good,Publix is a great company to work for. Only that is wrong is the supervisors  Publix check in people . Meeting other peoples. learn to be a better security officer
good,Promises will be made about the amount of hours you will get and then those same promises are broken by the same person who promised them to you. Not a permanent career for anyone with a family.
good,"Very kind staff, very clean environment. Schedule rotates. Not much room for advancement or raises. Evaluations very strict. Fun people and great customers."
good,I ring customers orders. Communicate with them about their day. I learned that customer service is the key to a great business. Management has been great. Workplace is nice. The hardest part of the job is not being able to satisfy every customer.
good,I enjoyed working at publix because i got to interact with different people everyday and it showed me how to preform great customer service. I also enjoyed making friends with my co workers.
good,"Management and co-workers were wonderful.  Hardest part of the job was wearing a hairnet for me personally, though I agreed the necessity was a health requirement.  The best part of the job was learning how to prepare and up-sale the ingredients to new recipes that was presented to the customers and/or general public whom visited the store.  The worst part of the job was never getting enough hours on the weekly schedule to barely make a good paycheck as well as adequate enough paycheck to continue to commute the 30 miles to work.  It wasn't what I was looking for though I gave it a shot."
good,I worked at my previous location for 2 years and I loved it. I relocated to go to school and the management was horrible. They disrespected my working and did not agree with the hours that I provided them that I could work.
good,"Accepting the fact that management can be a bit unfair towards employees and what they deserve, for example full time and or the hours they need to be able to pay their bills on time. One week you'll get plenty of hours the next you'll barely be working three days. It's incredibly difficult to acquire a full time position."
good,The company is vary hard to advance form the bottom and  if you do you have to kiss a lot but to even have a chance of advancement verses the quality of work you put in
good,"If you're younger, and wanting to make some money, Publix is the place to go. It's a great way to build customer service experience, as well as valuable life lessons."
good,"Work is tedious.  Good focus on customer.  Not much communication on expectations. Need to be noticed by managers, but hard to be an exceptional worker.  Better have social/political skills."
good,"Very corporate place, it was all about just the numbers. Was an overall good place to work as an associate. Once you get into management it gets pretty cut throat."
good,It's a hit or miss; hours for part timers are inconsistent unless you have an amazing assistant manager and coworkers. Full time is next to impossible to get. Promotions are next to impossible to get. Turnover rates are high and skyrocketing with the direction the company is going. Not many people are happy staying with Publix but more so tolerate it. Publix is not a company that treats the associates like actual people anymore. It's becoming Walmart.
good,It's cold and you never know how many numbers you might have to do or how long your going to be there. A lot of people are rude that already been working there for years.
good,"It’s a great place to work, however, the management is extremely inconsistent when giving hours. Great employees that get along for the most part and all are hard working."
good,"My department manager was amazing. The store manager was terrible. He never approved overtime, would not hire anyone new to help with workload and he blamed the departments with the district manager would ask how the store was failing."
good,The job itself was alright. Pretty simple to do. Management not really involved but I absolutely loved my teammates. I was in school and worked here...
good,"A typical day at work starts entering at 10 AM, putting my apron on and stepping into the back to see the work we have set up to do for the day. I grab a float loaded with a specific aisle and take it out to replenish the shelves. I greet the customers I see along the way to the aisle I have to work in. Management isn't the best, but it's expected to be that way at whatever establishment you're employed at. The hardest part of the job is pleasing your superiors specifically, they can't decide if they want it left or right at the end of the day."
good,Great leadership in retail locations but lack of reality in corporate setting. Great benefits. Company seeing significant changes with leadership shift and losing focus on customer service.
good,"Publix is good if you're a hard worker or you flake by and play their games. If you bleed green doesn't matter if you work or not they'll reward you. Just pretend like you care, and actually don't work too hard because they'll praise you but will exploit you until the end. Specially if you're a full timer, they will suck you dry for nothing.  They indoctrinate and force feed you Publix beliefs."
good,"the deli isnt a great place to be at publix, with poor managment and customers berating you the deli always seemed like the end road for alot of associates."
good,"Is a great place to work for if you are planning to retire from Publix, but the management is really bad! For you to grow up in this company.. you need to know someone and kiss a lot of butts!"
good,"this company is an awesome place to work, from CEO's down to baggers, you are apart of a family at this company. "
good,Good company overall doesn’t promote the right people. Management style drives away good employees because they don’t feel valued and feel under appreciated for there hard work and dedication.
good,Publix is a good company to work for. They offer stock benefits to only Publix employees. They also care about their customers and will go above and beyond.
good,The people around you make it a pleasant place to work for. The job is like most other places except a little more strict on policies such as name tags and appearance.
good,To begin the day is a good experience if you work in front. I like this because I can keep everything in order and clean and on time. Is not a hard work if you are organized and do not waste your time. I enjoy talking to customers. I enjoy seen customers giving back a smile face.
good,this was tough for me as i tried to juggle both work and family trying to make everyone happy and cracked under the pressure. the deli manager was really nice though
good,"This is only my personal experience, and does not necessarily reflect upon the whole company. I witnessed an insane amount of disregard for food safety and the health and safety of employees. The entire department was always extremely criticized for any sick days taken, even when the manager would take about one per week. Any complaints I lodged fell on deaf ears as politics were much more important than results."
good,"It was fun working there because of the amount of friends I made there. Other then that, it had no value to my skills. I enjoy working there. I was a  cashier, as with all jobs concerning money, sometimes there would be discrepancies in the money matters, but it would clear out. No issues other then it was just a job. Not something I would consider long term"
good,"If you're in your late 30's to early 40's and you start at the bottom you can give up advancing at this store. The pay is low and the hours are bad. Management will promise promotion then give it to the ones who are in their 20's. It doesn't matter how many years experience you bring to the table."
good,Closing is about the toughest thing you can do because it requires you to stay between 12 a.m. to 1 make sure you get enough rest and your detail oriented and cleaning up
good,"Publix is an easy job with okay benefits if you are willing to move up in the company. Nice people. Very clean and professional. A lot of people move in and out, so you get to meet a variety of people."
good,"Publix is a place o literally only do your job and go home. even though your suppose to only do that anyway. publix is the type of place where perfection is the key for everything. everything must be perfect to work there, and lets be honest who's perfect?"
good,"Publix is a wonderful place to work Part-time and allows a change to meet various people. However, it is not all it is seen to be. The company is very demanding and you will be expected to work long shifts. The worst part of the job is you will rarely get many hours of work a week."
good,overall the company is a great investment however management and location play a key roll in stress level. customers can be very rude and demanding. management can lack compassion and appreciation towards hard work and what you deserve.
good,I was not there very long. I started in the deli which I didn't want but they insisted. After I didn't do well they finally put me in the bakery.  According to one employee I was very slow and she ridiculed me in front of other employees. She was the only problem I had. I quit when I got a better offer from another company.
good,"publix is a good company to work for, they have paid tuition, vacation, 401k, health insurance, everything someone is looking for in a job. Go Check out publix today."
good,"Great job for college students, little room for improvement, people are nice and friendly. Management is poor and needs improvement only in the Savannah area."
good,"working at publix was great besides being part-time forever, it seems to be alot of favoritism in each department, its always alot of work for little pay."
good,"A typical day at Publix is decent. As I stated above, the managers aren't the best. They're flip floppy and hard to get along with. It's almost hard to adjust because new rules are being enforced every day. The workplace culture is a 5 out of 10. They show favoritism and treat a lot of employees like they're kids. Opinions don't matter and problems don't get resolved. The hardest part of the job is following your schedule. We're scheduled to get out at a certain time but always stay 2-3 hours over. The most enjoyable part about the job is actually interacting with the customers and putting a smile on their faces."
good,"ring up customer groceries assisting customer with questions , the other employees and nice to work with but u can stand for long hours which I don't like"
good,Good side is I've worked here for over 15 years first full time and now part time and have been lucky to have some great managers and leaders at the company. Other side is if you work in the retail stores the general concept of work and life balance is difficult to achieve. There isn't a option for a set schedule if you are a full time employee.
good,"As a front service clerk, you must have a lot of patience with not only Publix customers but also your co-workers. A variety of people are hired at Publix and many of them are quite fun. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with customers' needs when we are already understaffed. The scheduling system is very inconsistent with work hours given."
good,"The business is a good business because of your benefits and you can make good money. The management isn't very good, they lie a lot and give poor hours. They hire new people every month when the original workers don't have more than 10 hours per week."
good,"I Enjoy my co workers "
good,I enjoy working with others on my team.  I strive to always take care of our Security Officers and constantly explore ways to build morale and motivate.
good,"Cashier, customer service, get along well with other associates. I've learned to ""tweak"" my customer service skills. The hardest part of the job is standing in one place for so long. I enjoy interacting with customers."
good,"I was with Publix 15 years, one of the only Publix stores in Deland until the 90's,  I learned a lot from working there with the woman of that time, when the founder George Jenkins use to come into the store, very different culture then now, but good group of people I worked with back then...."
good,"Your everyday schedule is different. The co-works were mostly young teenagers, so there was never a dull moment. Management was always right there to help with any problem the cashier or customer has."
good,Management was horrible and overall organization of advancement among employees lacked greatly.
good,"Great place to work,Most enjoyable part for me was closing."
good,"This company is well known company . It may look good from outside ,but there are some flaws depending on the management of that store. Benefits are great ,but no work like balance."
good,"If you dont have a great team to work with, or you dont get along with your team/ managers then working for publix is a nightmare. I honestly really rather work in the hot sun in Texas near the closets point to the equator. I was told that the benefits weren't to be used til i reach five years. store 817"
good,Company hard to advance unless you are in the right crowd. Getting full time is a lost waiting list.
good,"The co-works for the most part are fun people to work with."
good,"Of all the jobs I've had, I gotta say this has been my favorite. I loved interacting with my customers & co-workers. I learned so much. However, they are extremely strict about everything. They recently set new rules for everything. They have lost some of the best workers they ever had, due to the fact that people do have lives besides publix, & occasionally, peoples kids are sick, in the hospital, people losing family members etc. They tell u that family comes first, but they don't really mean it. I've seen people go into work sick as dogs with fever, etc. But they r too scared to miss work cause they don't care. They don't want to hav to hunt sum1 to take ur place. No matter what happens, they expect you to show up for work. But inspite of all that, I still loved it! "
good,Its just a job for high schoolers. Not worth it unless its full time.
good,"A typical day began with seaching for a vehicle to drive.Pre-trip inspection followed by receiving your run (delivery)for the day.Deliveries include interaction and asssistance from associates at the stores.The hardest and sometimes most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with co-workers, traffic,and bad weather."
good,"A typical day at Publix is very busy. I have larned many different things while working here. Some examples are processing prescriptions using different override codes, speaking with insurance companies regarding issues with medications, and most importantly how to deal with a few very difficult patients and having them leave with a smile! I would say that is the hardest part of my job!! I get along well with my co-workers and members of management very well. The most enjoyable part of my job is me being able to help someone and making sure that they are happy when the leave the pharmacy."
good,Most all positions are understaffed with increased expectations for results. Leadership is out of touch with the day to day.
good,usually i start my day off by bagging then going out doors to receive carts. basically i help customers threw out the store.
good,"Publix is flexible with your hours, especially good for those going to school/college. If you are willing to stay with the company they will train you for advancement in the company. Offers cross training in different departments to gain more hours or to help the store out when needed. Working with the public is very demanding and takes a lot out of you. Customers can be very rude and demanding so you must have great customer service skills."
good,"If you get scheduled at least 20 hours a week, its a fantastic job with amazing benefits. If not however, the job is very average compared to others. The hardest thing you'll have to do is clean the store, which is not very hard after the first time you're trained."
good,"This is a fine place to work. They allow flexibility with work schedule.If you want to move up into management, then there is a possibility. It may take some time to advance."
good,Fine place for a first time job. Management varies by store and the one I worked at could have had more friendlier managers to workers. If you want advancement it takes a really long time
good,"It is very hard to move to another department or transfer. I have previously worked for Publix in the late nineties as a customer service desk and cashier. I love working for Publix but not in the Deli department. I only accepted deli to get back into Publix, however once your in deli it's hard to move or get out."
good,"Start you work day 6 a.m."
good,"I work in event planning at Publix, there is no opportunities to get promoted. Hours vary too much. Pay is good but raises are small;  .25¢ each 6 month after evaluations. Travel reimbursement is quite small too for having to drive around your own car for delivering customer orders."
good,"I like my job, I just don't believe that we get paid well enough to deal with the extra stuff Publix require of us compared to that of a normal grocery store."
good,I have work for 12+ yrs and still am PT. I have met w/ management and followed the correct procedures but have been drug along and fed bull for over 2 yrs now. I am no longer willing to wait for then to make up their mind. I need sincere and direct decisions.
good,"The people who work there will become your family, they offer every chance for growth imaginable. You have an opportunity to be something big, but the hours aren't ideal for family people."
good,"I was initially hired with the expectation of becoming a full time employee. After 3 months, full time employment was not offered and another job opportunity presented itself, so I put in my notice."
good,I enjoy assisting my customers at Publix. They are Funny and Loyal to me as a Cashier. I look forward to seeing my customers and coworkers. I will be there for a few more years.
good,"I have worked at Publix for almost seven years.  Publix is an exceptional place for a first job.  It takes a long time for employees to move up in the company though.  Also, seniority plays no role in scheduling.  I have enjoyed my years at Publix!"
good,"Overall a good place to work, moving up or receiving full time is very difficult. I would reccomend for a first time job given the available flexibility."
good,"Good company to work for, limited paths for advancement. Management is fairly easy to obtain, however further promotions are limited due to amount of people interested."
good,"Publix as a whole is a good company, like any corporation it has its short comings. Depends on the store you work for and the area that store is located. It’s hard to give an overview of every store"
good,"Public's has it own down side working part time with them was good but it was not my career choice it was mostly to pay descent amount of my bills. I really did enjoyed working there at beginning i enjoyed talking to a custimers traveler, hearing there stories on where they came and etc... building relationship with customers was really fun and relaxing."
good,"The initial training was in a different position that I currently hold.  "
good,"Open to training those never worked in a grocery store."
good,"The company is not bad in general but the management is horrible, if you try to avoid the management you can have pretty decent time actually... Most people are decent (there are bad apples in every company) but the true downside of this company is really the management... they hired a new guy end of last year and he is absolutely clueless, also tried to blame the workers about his failed strategy because they ""didn't do it properly"" but when your strategy is ""do nothing"" it's hard to not do it properly..."
good,Fun job but after 3 years you get burned out. Your pay varies based on your speed and efficiency which was nice but it seemed like new rules would be enacted to slow you down.
good,"A day in the life involves installing, maintain, building or buying software applications.  Process and multi level security are a part of life. Management is interested in metrics.  Work life balance in not much of a concern."
good,"Not a bad place to work. It made me realize how much i really don’t like working with the public, but the work environment wasn’t bad. Everybody looked out for each other and there was a level of respect I don’t see much elsewhere. You’re treated like a human being. We always had a guaranteed break time.Unfortunately, one of my manager’s didn’t favor me and started cutting my hours and eliminating my pay raises, so I ended up having to look for another job."
good,"I enjoy my job at Publix. Everyone is friendly, it is a good company to work for. I do a lot of different things in the pharmacy from your average customer service, to going above and beyond to get patients what they need."
good,Publix Warehouse is a great place to work. We get free meals everyday and get paid fairly too. The only downside is the management. They don’t seem to care about your needs unless you make a big deal out of it.
good,If you manage to get full time there are many great benefits available for you. The number one priority is customer service. You either have great management or you have horrible management.
good,"I don't get many hours, usually about 4-6 a day, 3-4 days a week. I mainly just bag groceries and retrieve carts from the parking lot. I learned patience and responsibility there. The environment is busy, always moving doing something."
good,Everything was quick and had to be done right. With one mess up you got in trouble and wasn't fair for one person to get in trouble when everyone else that messed up didn't.
good,"Fast pace and customers are god. Customers are allowed to treat you anyway they feel like and you are not allowing to defend yourself.. Thank God, the majority of the customers are nice and some are like family and friend.."
good,Publix is a great company to work fore its just that it is not convenient for a par timers like me because there is no sick pay or vacation pay for a part timer i find that very inconvenient.
good,"For a first job it was great! It helped me get some working experience. I Learned how to stock, block, maintain products and shelves as well as learn how the store works. The atmosphere is half relaxed, half tense: You're expected to be fast at your job even when you're first starting out, yet you're not required to run. Most of the associates are easy to get along with aside from a few exceptions. The hardest part of the job usually depends on the aisle you block as well as the time you're expected to finish it which can be ridiculous. Aisles that involve paper and school supplies are easy while others that involve soup cans and small products can be a challenge. If you work there just know you won't always live up to your bosses expectations and it can get chaotic at times."
good,"I enjoyed my job even though it was stressful at times. However, after 6 years of devote service, FT was still a distant dream. As Publix has become more about the dollar sign than benefiting the employees. They keep most employees PT now so they don't have to pay benefits."
good,Management plays favorites and doesn't like being told when things are not being done correctly. Not being able to do the job correctly because of interference from others.
good,"Shopping can be stressful. Publix loves to enrich the customer shopping experience, by providing legendary service to all. No matter who you are, help is always there at just a question of "" excuse me, may I help you?"""
good,It was fun but she put a new hire employee and i asked liked 3 months prior of him getting cashier and he got it before me and i felt very bad at myself.
good,Helping people. Learning the stocks and how to keep things organized and going after the things people need so they stay happy and keep coming back to the store.
good,"Good job but difficult to advance unless you are a favorite. Hard work alone won't get you promoted, you have to follow direction without question or thinking outside the box."
good,Best southeast supermarket chain to work for in this period of time.  It’s been the leader in customer service and stock reimbursement investment via paycheck and company match making everyone feel an integral part of the company
good,Company offers good benefits as long as you are completely vested. Part-timers have no benefits. Company rather hire minors than to give the opportunity to an adult in need of a job to make end meet.
good,"I started working at Publix almost 3.5 years ago. I started out as a front service clerk, and have since transferred to the produce department. It has been a good part time job in the evenings for me. The managers have worked with me to help make my schedule work with my other job."
good,"Publix is a good company, but the department I worked at was run by  female managers, and would only promote their friends who were girls, I was working my way up, but my managers were 18 -30 girls who obviously had their own thing going."
good,"I enjoyed the schedule and employees as well as the Guests. "
good,"So i just started working at publix a few weeks ago as a deli clerk and i can tell you now. The pay every week is nice but things take a turn right away in the deli! Im part time working over 31 hours mostly and i just feel like im being used. To get no lunch discounts or any discounts in the store sucks, my coworkers can be a bit bossy and some have bad attitudes, and lastly the customers ARE RUDE. You have to have thick skin especially in a busy area. My publix is understaffed and no one else is being hired. For 11$ an hour i guess i can deal being a college student but be prepared to not get out at scheduled timing especially during closing or rush times. Overall i enjoy when it isnt too busy i just wish recieved more than the benefits provided especially when you have to wait just to recieve any of that"
good,"Busy doing multiple tasks from leveling to inventory control"
good,Anyone can do this job so the only way you can distinguish yourself is through hard work.It takes forever to  be promoted. The job is boring but stable.
good,Great start as a first job in customer service. You get the real experience of customers and working with other people. It can be rough during summer days with the heat with no water breaks. Constant working and they demand you always be doing something productive.
good,"I worked for Publix for nine and one half years. It is a good place to work if you happen to have the right store manager and district manager. It was one of the best retail pharmacies to work for. However, the last few years they have become just like CVS and Walgreens.  Metrics have become more important than customer service"
good,"Being the first job I ever started Publix has taught many values of customer service. It was no walk in the park as a Stock Clerk in a supermarket, but not only has the company has taught me the meaning of hard work, but the meaning of kindness, patience and family."
good,Publix is a decent company to work for. They pay decently and will usually work with your scheduling needs. They also have certain bonuses that are given through out a calendar year.
good,"A typical day as a cashier would be standing at your register and waiting for costumers to come to you. If it is slow managers would like for you to stay busy by doing miscellaneous tasks such as getting carts, refilling candy, making coffee, refilling the bags, and simple cleaning tasks. You learn quick how to satisfy the costumer needs while continuing to work at a fast pace. The culture of the store depends on the management, but the people who work with you keep the job enjoyable. The only downside would be having to deal with some mean costumers and the inconsistent hours. Some stores do allow you to trade shifts and add extra hours (it depends on the management), but not all stores do. This is the most annoying part about working here because, if you need more hours you have to wait till someone else calls out so you don't know much in advance."
good,I want a more enjoyable work place. I would like to go to work and learn something new. I personally do not like to take an hour long lunch break. I like a 30 minute lunch. Quick turn around and go back to work.
good,"I wish I could've stayed, but my financial situation and my injury required me to leave. I didn't like the salary over time. It fit my needs in the beginning, but that kind of payment would not facilitate any kind of life outside of living with a parental figure."
good,I thoroughly perform my tasks and I've learned how to be properly organized. The management is strict but the co-workers are enjoyable. The work can sometimes be tedious.
good,"I loved working at publix, however, when they too all of oart time's inventory bonus away I was bothered. They took it away for the full timers to get more money for their holiday bonus. At least that's what I was told. Though we still do get a holiday bonus as well. Also, I don't like that you don't get a raise when you move up a position. That's not fair."
good,Very difficult to advance into management. Almost there and then being told there are no positions available. Daily routines are pretty set in stone. The desire for advancement is long and tedious but it's hard to do unless you know someone higher up to push for you.
good,"I work in the deli department which extremely fast pace due to the lunch time and store location. We are right off the 75 interstate, and being we carry most items and a pharmacy we have a steady flow of customers. I was part time, so we did not receive any benefits. I did not like the idea we have to wait one year for benefit and Publix hire only part time associates. Even with these shortcoming, I love working for Publix and the co-workers I worked around. I still recommend anyone to work for Publix, my reason for leaving the position is medical. I could not do the long standing, causing severe leg and ankle pain."
good,This company cares about the community and their employees.  I check customers out all day everyday and the routine only changed if the cashiers were scheduled to help bag.  Management seemed to work with you on scheduling. but only if it worked for them.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the cranky customers that came into the store and the most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers who all seemed like my other family.
good,"Depending on what day it is the paste would be fast. I learned how to communicate easily based on what a customer is buying or even the energy they're giving off. Most enjoyable part of my job, whether I am in the meat department or on the register, is the customers and helping them when they need it."
good,"I learned how to communicate with co workers and customers, the management is outstanding, they make you feel like family and will go out of there way to treat you well, the job isn't hard, I think meeting new people is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,It really was a good place to work but the management was a joke. They had no idea what they were doing and made a lot of hollow treats. Another thing is that they never followed through with discipline so everyone got away with anything.
good,Publix is a great company but not a good fit for me. I work full time hours under a part time category. I would maybe get one a day a week off. One incident I tried to schedule a day off in which my request was ignored completely.
good,"fast pace, take on a lot of responsibility, long days, no consistent schedule, deal with difficult customers, 401k and stock options, great customer service experience, phone experience"
good,Publix is a great company but it is very stressful environment. The hours varied way to much and the pay you received for the amount of work you did was not worth it.
good,"Although the busier times are a bit stressful (busiest store in region), for the most part it is a good company to work for- great benefits, advancement is possible (especially if you are willing to change stores).  If you work full-time be willing to give up most of your family time.  Management is not always well trained."
good,The roles at Publix are great for students and young employees. their wages fall short of those expected from the head of household. You cannot provide for your family unless you are in management.
good,"On a typical work day you run through a lot of customers. Its known for customers to be extremely rude and you have to deal with it. Management is awesome but extremely unorganized. The honestly the hardest part of the job is the job in general.You learn to cook certain items, restocking floor products, making customers orders based of specifics, date and price items, and also learn how to have more patience when it comes to people."
good,"Publix is a great first job to have, especially when you're young and just starting out, I have learned that it taught me a lot about having patience with customers and providing the best customer service I can!"
good,"During my day at work I handle Western Unions, Money Orders, Customer returns and complaints, answer and transfer calls and handle money(customer transactions and cash office duties). Publix has taught me how to handle challenging customer situations with a calm composure. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers (who are most of the time wrong) and trying to extinguish the problem."
good,"I do say, my first few weeks with the company proved rather nice. However, between a rigorous academic schedule and the late-night hours required of a stock clerk, I found a dangerous lack in a good night's sleep."
good,cashier for groceries; standing for long periods of time. Inability to advance to a higher level; enjoyed working with customers and finding products needed.
good,"Work on keeping the store clean and once I've done most of the cleaning go and dry dust the floors and remove scuff marks on the floor, I would go outside to gather the shopping carts, then bag items then go back cleaning the store for closing. most part if you fast you don't get yelled at a first time Management that has no experience in running a store and the other Management don't know what they are doing. And after getting hurt doing things they told me to do without having training and not covering the cost of the hospital bill was the last draw."
good,"Typical day was testing new and existing software applications.  During the time I worked at Publix, I enjoyed many friendly people and I do miss them.  "
good,I had fun working here. Started as a bagger and moved to produce very quickly. Mangers are good for the most part. but be prepared to be relocated on a regular basis.
good,"Publix is very customer service oriented. If you are seeking management positions they work with you trying to succeed your goals. Depending on which department you are hired on to, the work load is extremely demanding."
good,"Publix can be a great place to work. If you're in school they work with your schedule. It just depends if you're full time or have a great manager. It's really hard to move up and the hours vary, they're NEVER consistent."
good,"Publix managers are pretty hit or miss. My current manager is a wonderful and upbeat guy who is dedicated to helping his employees and teamwork. However, my previous manager would demean and punish her employees while hiding away in the office for hours. The company is constantly expanding, and therefore, very quick to promote to management, which is sort of a double-edged sword. I've seen some great hard-working folk promoted into management, but then I've seen the workers who try so hard they treat the others around them like dirt."
good,"As stated above, good pay, however can be slightly nit-picky at times about things like uniform and customer service. Breaks were good. Starting pay for a bagger is $9."
good,"A typical day of work is preparing foods to be sold; leafy salads, pasta, chicken and tuna salads, desserts, party trays consisting of sandwiches, meats & cheeses, cold cuts and fruit. Plus hot foods such as fried chicken several ways hot lunches with 6 choices of vegetables and more choices of entrees. Then there's the sub sandwich station. Many patrons say they like Publix' sandwiches better than many of the other competitors because of the quality of the products and the price."
good,"Great place to work , but no growth potential in certain areas  , Managers try their best but many are under trained and lack interpersonal skill. The people are great but there is no growth potential in certain areas."
good,A typical day at work in the Publix Deli consists of working in a fresh food department along with a costumers come first attitude. It is rewarding every time a customer is pleased with their service.
good,"I enjoy working for publix. I dont enjoy the fact that we are currently being micro-managed to the point where it is exhausting to come into  work. My managers are great and seem to really care about me. there are a handful of employees that I work well with , mainly because they are the only ones that speak english. I don't have a problem with workplace diversity,but some employees dont speak or comprehend english and it makes my job very difficult."
good,"Publix was fast passed, and fun. I worked as a cashier and as a Deli Clerk, I also was crossed trained in the Bakery and as a stock clerk."
good,"Publix is a remarkable company to work for! They are very structured in their training. Management style varies with each location. All full-time associates are at the mercy of the automated scheduling system which can take some getting used to. The days can be long but the rewards are great with bonuses. If you're looking for a career in any department of the supermarket, with plenty of opportunity for advancement, then Publix is for you!"
good,"Always keeps you moving around"
good,"All employees are like family so a typical work day at Publix, is practically like being home. We all work together and do our part as associates to ensure that customers come and leave satisfied."
good,A typical day at work involves non-stop flow of customers and a high demand for complete efficiency as part of the customer service staff. I've learned to effectively handle situations involving all sorts of personality types and more importantly how to do my part to diffuse a climbing situation based on protocol.
good,"Usually understaffed, but days move fast. if things go wrong, and someone is injured, store manager just says ""get over it"" "
good,I got this job fresh out of high school and it was a great starter job. The salary was low but what can you expect for a 17 year old kid with no college degree?
good,"Changing in style of leadership, no promotions from within. All upper management hire from outside company. I have been there a long time and seen lots of changes to the companies philosophy."
good,Best part of the job was helping customers and seeing smiles on their faces.I learned different methods of training people and how each individual varies in learning.
good,"It is Publix which is great, it is like work heaven unless you are in the Deli which is like the dark part of in heaven. Deli is stressful and runs like a dictatorship. The Deli is the dark dirty corner of each store that very few enjoy."
good,"Nice place to work with great potential for advancement. Good compensation for managers, descent benefits, long hours, erratic weekly scheduling."
good,had to keep store clan and neat. keep customers satisfied ..have a good knowledge on where all products are in store .. unload and reload trucks.. organize inventory in back room and on shelves
good,"Publix is a great place to work, the managers want to help you succeed. The customers and co-workers are like family.  I learned how to provide Premier Customer Service and to take pride in everything I do."
good,"Publixt es una empresa dedicada a la publicidad e impresion digital."
good,fast pace work place and have to be a hard worker I opened the store I liked that better than closing the store. met a lot of different people learned different meats and cheeses and now I love more different foods
good,"I am a Registered Pharmacy Technician after working for the company for 6 months and on a daily basis I assist the Pharmacist with daily functions. Call insurance, fill prescriptions, greet customers when they either drop off or pick up their prescriptions. I also do data entry with the info written on the prescriptions and process any insurance or drug manufactured coupons. I enjoy working in the pharmacy, but I am hoping to go back to school and get a Masters degree in Social Work, but hoping to gain more knowledge in the mental health field before deciding."
good,"Working for the company for 3 years, ive tried to advance myself in their branches. i started as a bagger, worked up to cashier, denied customer service, and now currently im doing publix simple meals as a aprons clerk. Ive learned alot about customer service and being able to bend and cooperate under difficult circumstances. The best part of the job is seeing customers that ive bonded with and even if they are not shopping the come in to say hi, because of the service i gave them."
good,"My co-workers are cool and fun to be around, my managers are not. I enjoy being able to help customers with their needs, and I love scanning their groceries."
good,unload freight and stock shelves and help customers. co-worker help in other areas of the store when need.There's no help from management for future promotions.
good,The people are amazing to work with and the work is non-intensive. Publix prides it's self in high customer service. The guidebooks are very easy to read and very informative.
good,I was put in difficult positions with the tractor and trailer. the assignments were given out unfairly.
good,They are a great company to work for with great benefits and great potential. Co-workers are great and working with the public can be fun. I have learned many things over the years from work related things like cash handling skills and inventory control. I have also learned great lessons in life like working with the public and enjoying the small pleasures in life. Any job can be trying at times but every day came with new lessons to learn.
good,Very fast-paced cashier work.  Much standing and a lot of smiling and talking.  I enjoyed customer relations.  My co-workers were friendly.  The hardest part of the job was sometimes ten or twelve hour shifts with no breaks aside from the unpaid lunch hour.  Most enjoyable part was the satisfaction of working a responsible position and doing my job well.
good,It was a fun places to work but had its problems did not really want to give hours
good,Start at 4pm and finish by 4am.  Focus on the job while dealing with cold and wet conditions.
good,"There is little no room to advance in this industry, no store benefits, my store is very focused on race, managers override what you say to the customers. never get out of work on time"
good,"It was my first real job that didn't involve mowing lawns at the time. Short 6 hour shifts two to three days a week. Simple responsibilities and easy work loads from day to day. Management was decent at worst and decent at best, nothing special to be perfectly honest. Same thing can be said about fellow employees. The worst portion of my employment was probably any outside work during harsh weather conditions (it was a simple job). The most enjoyable had to have been about payday as the job itself was rather bland in terms of excitement or otherwise standing apart. The only thing I can say is that I would have better invested my time with a lawn mower in those days."
good,"On a daily basis I work with the general public and help them find what they need as well as to have a great shopping experience. The most enjoyable part of this job was to see all of the customers happy, knowing that I had something to do with it."
good,"Publix is a good place to work for while being a fulltime student in school, they have flexible hours, and have many different department opportunities. They start off with good pay, and good hours."
good,"Publix is a great place to work for, especially if you don't mind your hours varying. The People and customers are typically nice. The only con for me about this job is the varying hours. There's no set hours, it Ranges From 14-25 hours a week and you go in at different hours every day. it isn't constant. All in all the management, coworker's are great once you get to know them. This job has opened up my views as well as helped me become outspoken and customer oriented. it taught me that its not always about you. The most enjoyable time is getting to know the employee's and being able to assist customers properly knowing they're satisfied."
good,"Created pastries on a conveyor line. Supervised a crew of six to ten people working on the conveyor line. Helped pack pastries in the frozen department. Created rolls, pies, breads for frozen packing and shipping."
good,I helped hundreds of customers each day. I had to deal with coupons and price matching. The management was very friendly. All of my coworkers were very friendly as well. I had to provide everyone with the best customer service around.  
good,A typical day started at 5 am and included many jo tasks. Enjoyed working with the public and seeking new ideas of making improvements to make the job easier
good,"Productive and fun work place, only problem is that they are cutting hours and one cannot live off the hours they give. i have to find another job to compensate for the loss of hours. I am used to working over 60 a week and i am only getting less then 35 a week now"
good,Go in to work and work with customers and also cook good recipes for the customers to sample.
good,"The Pharmacy is a well oiled machine, we will complete 250 to 300 different prescriptions in a day. I have learned all required skills and techniques to be an efficient pharmacy technician with in 6 months. Publix offers exceptional customer service. Management is well organized and has high expectations. The hardest part of the job is smiling when a customer completely insults you. The most enjoyable part is helping the sick patients feel better."
good,My pharmacy district manager was a nice guy but didn't explain newly instigated pharmacy programs in depth with assistants. They were OK to work for but I'm looking for other work elsewhere at this time.
good,"I learned that the harder you work in the position you're in you may get over looked, but keep trying to succed or pursue other opportunities elsewhere to actually become secure."
good,Im Need More Looking Better my Career Goals. Like Taking Care Of Customers Make Sure they are been taking Care of..
good,"The schedules where flexible, the people nice, and the work not to strenuous. I recommend this job to people who are just starting out or are just rejoining the work force"
good,"Publix is a great company to work for if you enjoy working with the public. Great benefits for part-time and full-time. Great opportunity to move up, and only internal promotions."
good,The good management team and fellow staff. I enjoyed my time working there and was given plenty of opportunities to grow and learn as a Publix employee.
good,Ive been working there for a really long time and being doing everything i can an they never gave me a rase. I will have to go weeks an weeks without working because they never let me work.
good,"Overall, it's pleasant enough. The management preaches about making a career of the company and about how we're a family at Publix. They go on to talk about how you can move up in the company. While this may be true for some, it's not guaranteed. If a manager doesn't like you, they can slander your name and reputation to other managers to the point where you are basically stuck in one position forever. It's not bad work, but it's not good for long term."
good,"Es una empresa dinámica, organizada y de oportunidades me encantó trabajar allí"
good,The company doesn't like giving hours to people who have things to do outside the job. They'll give you 1 day a week schedules and you get paid little for that week cause of that.
good,"I've had good stores and bad stores.My most recent and last store was the worse. It depends on the management. Overall management fine. Most recent was so angry, mean and rude that the whole grocery department quit (literally)."
good,Publix was a fantastic place to work! They provide all nessacary trainings to all their associates. Its a great place to start a career and build a foundation.
good,a whole year in the Publix deli is enough for a lifetime
good,Publix was initially a great place to work but more recently like the rest of the industry has become increasingly stressful with less supporting help. Supervisory micromanagement is an issue and can be hindering at times.
good,"Overall a good company, but opportunities not available as presented in the interview. The Customer Service Team is very supportive and understands the concerns the front end employees have."
good,"In my opinion, working for publix is a great high school or college job. They are extremely flexible and easy about the times you need to work. Downside is, unless you plan to move up in the company, management isn’t always willing to help you."
good,I am proud to be a employee. Is a great experience working in retail. There are friendly associates that work with the company. Very clean store and storeroom.
good,A very important job with need of money counting skills. standing up at least 4-5 hours max with no breaks. Also being able to be friendly and approachable to everyone.
good,"Hours are flexible, things get a little hectic but it's pretty low stress normally. Vision and dental is offered to part time associates. Stock options available."
good,"Working as a deli associate was very interesting. Learning the different types of meats and cheeses, how to handle the cutlery, weighing the meat / cheese , packaging it all a certain way."
good,"Great place to begin working as a highschool or college student. Publix provides 401k matching, stock contribution and tuition reimbursement for part-time employees"
good,"Enjoyed working there alot of"
good,Great company with great benefits. Fast paced and friendly staff! Getting to know customers and what the liked to better serve them. The hardest part is just finishing production because there is a lot to do and make while helping customers in between
good,"Seeing and getting to know your regular customers, having the availability to help when needed and just being able to put a smile on another person's face."
good,"Working at Publix has made me realize the importance of customer service, and communication skills. I enjoy making customers have a memorable shopping experience."
good,"It was just an okay place to work while I was there, it is fast paced which is nice. The management was a revolving door during my time, thus making things inconsistent. Overall it is likely a good place to work ."
good,"The pay could be better and management can ruin the entire experience. Good coworkers can alleviate problems, but not all of them. The same works in the opposite sense as well."
good,High customer density workplace with multiple department opportunities and flexible hours and department staffing. occasionally understaffed but functional.
good,"I enjoyed working at Publix, there was always something different each day, the job tasks were the same but dealing with customers you never know what to expect,"
good,If Publix paid more in the corporate sector it would be perfect. with longevity you have the opportunity to obtain Employee Stock Options that garner dividends which you can use to purchase more stock. free money just for being an employee
good,"Great place to work, friendly people, great customer service, learned alot. They train you very well. Also many benefits they have to offer. The hardiest part of  the job is standing on your feet all day."
good,My typical day was definitely busy. The hardest part about that job was dealing with unsatisfied customers. I had to learn to have a lot of patience working for Publix.
good,"Employment at publix was fantastic. Here, we received the opportunity to further our skills in development, and customer service. We passionately served others as a team."
good,Was a good job unfortunately I wasn’t always given enough hours and I had to move to another city where a Publix wasn’t close. Working there with employees who were nice was amazing.
good,"I have greatly enjoyed my time at Publix while also being a college student.  They are willing to work around my school schedule, and they always care about me as an individual."
good,If you are looking for a company that you can retire and see that your hard worked money is going to benifit your future work at publix i regret quitting to work in retail I was there 5 years had stock built up and 401k my hubby had a good chunk in as well and the hours they really do work with you!!
good,"I was young when i worked here, money was decent but not much to live off but a solid first job for a high schooler but otherwise its not a bad place."
good,"Personally the place is a good starter job for someone, wouldn't recommend it for a retirement job. Scheduling can be very difficult from time too time and the pay could be a lot better than what is offered."
good,Existenunpatros de beneficios.  Pero no son los más óptimos al hacer un cuadro comparativo con otras en él misma área de desempeño
good,It's a good job to have while being in school. The hours are super flexible. The environment is usually nice and the associates are welcoming to one another and to the customers.
good,While upward mobility can be slow and you have to really work to get full time and or a management position it is worth it. Benefits including stock options are probably the best in the market. They take care of you and work with you for scheduling purposes. The culture was one the best I've been with.
good,"No breaks are scheduled frontend You have to ask to go to the bathroom "
good,The job met reasonable standards for the time being. I really enjoyed the work environment while it lasted. The job is very reliable and dependable. They also provided helpful staff.
good,I was hired on th spot. Started at pay rate of $9 per hour. Went from cashier to customer service after 3 months of being being with the company. Hours where limited
good,The typical week for a baker Clerk is preparing for the food and supply truck three days out of the week. The other days we maintained Publix standards by ensuring fresh baked goods and customer service.
good,"I left for more personal and health reasons, but its a great place to work for those just starting out. Many different positions to choose from and friendly team."
good,Enjoyed working at Publix and I would recommend family and friend to apply with this company. Its hard to get full time so if that's  your looking for it won't happen right away.
good,This is a great company to work for if you can handle the hours. They pay is great and being paid weekly was great. I’m just looking for something with better hours and benefits.
good,Pay sucks can’t afford to live on your own and barley with a roommate..... working 40 hours a week you should be able to afford that. I would recommend if you’re looking for advancement but managers have horrible schedules
good,"Working at Publix has been a great learning experience, for a first job it is very easy and my coworkers are nice people. A downside is that hours are not consistent and if you request a day off they punish you by limiting your hours."
good,"Work roughly 32 hours a week lifting objects up to 20 pounds and stocking products. Required to have excellent people skills as well as stay on your feet, and constantly moving for more than 8 hours a day."
good,"The mailing center at Publix is considered entry level. That includes the pay. It can be fun. there are some great people there. Other than the pay the hardest part is the hours, early morning 11-12 hour shifts on Monday. Some of the routes also have late shifts ending at 5:30. There are stock options which can make it worth it."
good,"This is an interesting place to be a chef. I still get to cook and explore my creativity, but also get to teach people how to cook. The guests want to be there and learn, which makes each class generally a positive experience."
good,Publix is a pretty decent place to work at but it mostly depends on how your coworkers are and how your manager is. If they are bad you'll have a bad experience.
good,Publix works on your hours and they’re always kind to de customers and associates. They’ll push you to try to escalate professionally and personally. A lot of people from here been working for years in this company so it means a lot.
good,"working here is like buying a mystery box of cards. you never know what you get until you open them. Some managers are amazing and I would love to work with them again, others if you didn't kiss the ring hardcore you never moved up and would be passed up for a promotion by someone who did."
good,"A fast-paced environment in the deli dealing with customers constantly. It will test one's patience, and I learned how to deal with all sorts of people. I enjoyed helping people and making their days better. I learned all aspects of the deli and the management was great. The hardest part of the job for me was when I made a mistake on somebody's order and upset them- I felt very bad but it is just part of the job, everybody makes mistakes."
good,"it it very close to home.convenient hour.i enjoy the people i work with.i enjoy meeting new people that come into "
good,"Publix has great benefits and as a result, is one of the few companies left that has many employees with the company for more than 10 years.  They also are very flexible with scheduling.  They are very family focused and it is understood that family is first."
good,I enjoyed being a bakery sales clerk fast paced kept busy met a lot of people.  You get to know the regular customers.  Part of the job was learning how to decorate baked goods.  Taking orders over the phone.  Holidays were very fast paced
good,"I had to be at work at 4:30 Am most mornings to unload trucks. I moved pallets of produce to either the cooler or the produce work space as needed and then began to unpack and get the produce to its proper location."
good,I need a place to work as a student in high school. I just finished school and I’m currently looking for a job in the morning and plan on keeping this job in the afternoon because if the possibility of eventually working on their shipment trucks
good,"Awesome fortune 500 company to work for, treats employees fairly, opportunity for advancement, benefits if full time. Lots of support from management."
good,I really liked publix it just didnt offer me a set schedule and when I was part time the hours like dissapeared. They don't like it when you find an alternate job. I have two children now and I would like to enjoy them growing up. I would go back to publix if i didn't have children it is a good place to work but now when you have a family to worry about.
good,A job thats good for beginners but definitely a stepping stone to something more. Management can be stubborn and will give the impression of hearing you out but mostly nods their heads and aits for you to move on with your complaints.
good,"Although I did have some issues with coworkers not doing what they were supposed to do and having to pick up their slack, it was an easy job, although fast paced and somewhat stressful at times"
good,"Publix is a fine place to work if you can stand highly variable hours in a part time position. Moving up to a full-time position is difficult and predicated on management giving you the option."
good,Publix is a great company if you're just starting your working journey. For me its not feasible as far as advancement considering my age. But yes overall a good company.
good,It was a good place.  The people were nice and everyone. I really have nothing to say about my time working at Publix. It was a place of employment and I worked there.
good,This job is very fun and easy.  you get to meet  and talk to a lot of people. The tasks assigned are extremely simple and anyone can do them. They give you a lot of busy work so your always doing something
good,"The company itself is good overall,  advancement tended to be who you were. Management changes in the stores were too frequent causing constant policy and procedure changes, sometimes just weeks apart. Makes for a difficult work experience."
good,Publix is a great place to work if you intend to stick it out for the long haul.  The ability to buy stock is wonderful.  Many of the customers are regulars and friendships are formed.  The hardest part of the job is the inconsistent schedule and having to stand on your feet for extended hours at a time.
good,Some chill some very very bossy although was a OK place to work at hardest part customer complaints  I learned alot to much to explain culture was amazing other staff were nice
good,"Great company to work at if you're in highschool, past that unless you're looking to transfer out of state to one of the newer areas you'll be at a severe disadvantage when it comes to career advancement or promotion. Within Georgia almost all managements spots are full, so you have to wait for someone to retire out for a position to open up at the top, which takes time to translate down towards the bottom of the ladder. That being said managers are generally fair with a few exceptions, they're understanding and flexible. Pay is pretty great, unbeatable by other grocery store standards ( stock clerks start at 11-12 an hour with zero experience where i was). Decent benefits although the quality has declined in recent years. Great retirement/stock options. "
good,Enjoyed working at Publix but the pay is to low to sustain a living. I was hired with no experience and trained for my job. Best take away is training in customer service.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with but it was just too boring for me and the hours they would give was ridiculous and I needed more in order to pay bills
good,I loved working here and taking care of my customers it was just the employees very rude and nasty attitudes very lazy too. But I loved my manager and store manager
good,"I was only part-time, but for full-time employees, Publix shows appreciation to those who work for them. Furthermore, the benefits are through the roof."
good,"Learn as much as possible, and work your way up.  The chances for success is greater when you're younger. Always be eager to learn, but humble enough to receive information."
good,"Always had something to do. Learned very little other than basic customer service. The management was bad, bad scheduling and improper ethics. Very rewarding culture, coworkers where the best. Hardest part of the job was keeping the shelves stocked and organized. My favorite part was that I had a chance to advance, but didn't as it wasn't my path."
good,"Publix is a great place to work,however you only receive approximately 25 hours per week as everyone is only hired part time and you do not receive full time until you are promoted.Our manager was horrible at scheduling and leading her team, she would leave during peak times while everything is in chaos. Hardest part of this job was trying to bail out all the co workers who fell behind on a constant basis especially during peak times. I enjoyed the interaction with customers at the counter and at the sub station."
good,"Able to work in a fast paced environment. "
good,"It is a nice environment. The management always kind, willing to lend a hand and they were very understanding . An average day was just stocking, and working the cash register. The hardest part, were the rude and ungrateful customers."
good,"I do not wish to ad this review, the website is forcing me to write something here in order for me to continue on. Publix is Employee owned. That is all i will say about it."
good,Cool I really liked it it was chilled and all my  co workers were hardworkworkers but I was upset when I had to move to another state and job searching is hard.
good,it is an enjoyable place to be in while one is attending college. workplace culture is very good as long as you work hard. the most enjoyable part is meeting up with new customers.
good,This is the perfect first job to have. I always tell people who are just starting at a young age to try to get into Publix. The hours are not amazing unless you are management but at least its a good place to start.
good,managers are terrible but customers and coworkers are great. some managers act as though they do not care about the associates abd as thugh publix is the only thing worth living for . if anyone gets a job here be prepared t live eat and breath publix. its hard for you to be in school and still work and get hours they dont really give hours like you need them too.
good,"Stressful fast paced environment . Room for advancement . Management quality varies from store to store , department to department . As a whole , a fewer company ."
good,"Publix's scheduling could use a lot of work. There is no set schedule, even for full time. My most recent manager was not at all interested in helping me advance in a career in Publix."
good,I starting working at Publix when I was 17. It was great for the first month until I turned 18 after that I closed almost every night when I had school the next morning at 7. I stressed this to management who make no changes until my availability was changed.
good,"I really liked my co-workers and my pay, but management here was very strict. If you don't like authority figures flexing their power, don't work here. Also, no benefits like a discount or free meals, just the pay for part time workers."
good,Publix is a good place to work but as any other jobs there are some ups and downs for intance as a part timer they cant just cut your hours from 35 to 20. I feel like I wanna start a career else where like in the medical field.
good,"Great culture, but advancement was extremely slow. Benefits were great, employee stock options were generous and his health insurance. If you don't need advancement, I'd recommend."
good,It can be laid back at times and we interact with hundreds of customers. We focus on premier customer service at all times and that each customer is satisfied. We have a diverse company and work with others with different backgrounds.
good,"You get to interact with the customers face to face at time, help them locate an item on the floor, properly input the medication they bring and follow pickup procedures. Work on troubleshooting, like making sure their insurance goes through or checking on the errors stated for certain medications. Fill and bag up each medications."
good,"I would have stayed, but the salary required was too low for my needs. I had a daughter in college that was moving out of state. My wife and I chose to follow her."
good,"people are friendly, associates work together, hours are not guaranteed though, no breaks aside from mandatory lunches, cross-training is available, management is pretty good about communication"
good,Publix is an awesome company to work for.  A typical work day is very fast paced at customer service. I have learned many different roles with the company. The hardest part about the job is having enough hours to schedule associates to accommodate business.
good,"It's a good company to work for. The management  appreciate the hard working employees,the only thing I font  like there is the work schedule, you will never know when they will schedule to work."
good,"There are never enough people working, the upper management doesn't like having a lot of workers. They overwork the knowledgeable people. I have been there on and off 26 years and barely make $14 hour. I love the people I work with and most of the time I enjoy the job. I wish they would give more PT benefits and reinstate bonuses. It is nice that you can change departments to get more experience."
good,It was my first real job. It taught me how important appearance is to the customer. It also showed me what working for a corporation was really like. g
good,"This job was really just a stepping stone for me as a first job while I was in High School. For me to learn about responsibility, do what the boss says, Uncle Sam takes a piece, and payday is Friday."
good,"Publix is a great place to work. Their pay is fair, great benefits, great coworkers, with a team environment. Plenty of opportunity for advancement, but manager's hours are very demanding."
good,"Back when there was six or seven hundred stores the culture was still upbeat with a lot of good folks all pushing in the same direction. The last several years, with the massive growth into northern states the culture has changed. Kind of like what happened to Walmart. Still a good deal. Stay under the radar, take advantage of the retirement program and you can be set for life in retirement."
good,Publix is a great company that gave me the chance to start working and learning the value of having my own money and being responsible. I am thankful for having the opportunity of beginning my work experience with publix.
good,I love working with people i would talk to even when not working. I love being able to get to know customers on a more personal level than just what they buy.
good,"It's a good company, but salary is not compatible with my expenses, and I don't get full health coveage. I am looking for better career opportunities."
good,"I have worked here for 2 years and so, at the beginning I liked it a lot, but now its gotten boring for me. Some managers are not very nice and dont care more about the associates."
good,"The company is great and offers many benefits to part-time workers, such as 401k. The company promotes from within, which is fantastic and the job security is amazing. However with that there is a low turnover rate for employees who are full-time and 4-5 years experience. This makes it near impossible for new hires to stick with the company."
good,"Very nice place to work, Cashier, Very good management team, hardest part for me is working with very young people, I enjoyed meeting all the customers and the employees"
good,"go in a 6am leave at 6pm"
good,"The job is not half bad, it's somewhat relaxed and easy going but he management is not so great. The managers are lazy don't really care about the associates below them and so on."
good,Publix was a great place but throughout the years alot of incentives was taken away and hours became harder to get. When she was at your max pay they made you work even harder almost in a way to get rid of you.
good,"A typical day in the deli at Publix was pretty smooth especially if you were trained well. You basically would prepare for your shift clocking in and washing your hands. If there is a customer waiting to be served, you are expected to help them immediately. Once your shift is over, you must make sure that all of the task required of you are completed."
good,"Only work at publix if you want to get started in your life. Definitely not a lifetime job, unless you are older and management material. "
good,"I believe that overall Publix is a good company, however the particular store that I worked for has horrible managment, we are constantly short handed according to my bosses yet I am pulling less than ten hours a week sometimes even though at my age I really need the hours to help pay for bills. Coworkers and other managers from other departments are constantly asking for me to cover call outs for their departments, yet my own department is having trouble scheduling myself."
good,My first experience at Publix was amazing. I loved my managers and they always worked with me to help suit my needs. I learned great social and people skills and how to go above and beyond to make sure the customers are helped appropriately. However the second time around the management really liked to take shortcuts on how they do things and they would never work with you to advance. They would also make schedules against your availability give you as few hours as possible.
good,Publix is a great place if you want to make it your career. I however didn't want Publix to be my career so it was only a temporary job for me. But while working there I created amazing friendships with so many people.
good,"Very easy to learn everything if you just pay attention, some of the managers are really nice, but some of them can be very rude or very intimidating."
good,"Depending on your department and store location it's constantly business. I loved that there wasn't a seniority problem, it was more so about work ethic and how hard a person worked. It was also a con though, harder shifts for harder workers."
good,"-Great Company"
good,It is a good place to balance school and work. Making friend is so easy. Smiling at costumers is a must but that make your shift more funny. Also is wonderful working with a great team
good,"Active place to work, management varies from store to store drastically and can entirely change your work experience. Flexible hours and benefits are a huge plus"
good,My mother has worked for Publix since before I was born. I have had many other family members work for this company also. I was happy at Publix until they knew I was going to move and therefore would not allow me to cross train into a department where I may have been happier. Overall it was a great experience and is where I honed all of my customer service skills. It was a great place for me to start my work experience and I would absolutely go back given the opportunity.
good,"Benefits made good friend, worked way up in the company."
good,"Long work days"
good,"Those of us who have worked since opening store - were guaranteed a certain number of hours per week. We have now received raises in the last 2 yrs and our hours have been cut as they are constantly hiring new teenagers at a much lower wage. As an an example, I normally received a minimum of 15 hours up to 24 hours per week. Last week I got 4 hours scheduled and this week I am scheduled for 3 hours."
good,"Just like any job, everything is good when you have the right management. I've a lot of good people while working at Publix. From time to time you can earn free half subs. Every month corporate will send a coupon for something in the store."
good,"It's a great place to work. Workplace culture is pretty chill, but get the job done. Management is awesome and understandable of situations. I learned how to cashier."
good,"se trabaja muy duro, los horarios son muy desgastante. No tienes fines de semanas libres."
good,"Different stores have a different vibe with the people hired. All areas from Florida to Alabama to South Carolina, the people are different. I Loved working for Publix in Florida. I did not enjoy the people/management in Alabama. Overall, Publix is a good place to work. Very chill and easy going."
good,"Publix overall is a decent company to work for in the retail sphere, pay is decent, hours are good if you prove yourself.  Hard to get fulltime, harder to get into management.  Perfect job for someone in between jobs or a college student trying to pay for rent and the like. They are flexible on scheduling but expect to have a very open schedule if you want to maximize your hours."
good,hours were inconsistent and the management at my store was awful. tried to hard to be by the book and would bend his back too far to please customers to the point where we would refund people boxes of chicken wings that they already ate and were coming back with just the bones. benefits are good if you qualify for them. only way to move up in the company is if you kiss the managers booty
good,"Publix is an overall good place to work. I went back to Publix while I was finishing a degree. They give you a great amount of flexibility in your schedule. Most managers I worked for were completely wonderful and supportive. One thing to know, Publix promotes from within. No amount of college education will get you a promotion. So if you are a cashier and want to move up to management- you best have the time to devote solely to Publix (completely open and available work schedule). My store is known for promoting young kids (18 and 19 year olds) who have no responsibility, no college education and can commit to working until 11pm. These kids started working at the store at 15 and have had 3 years or so to ""learn"". They get this ""supervisor"" role (as a staff member) and yet have no proper life training (or college) to help them understand what it means to be a leader."
good,"great place to work and for career advancement, great customer service, clean workplace, wonderful staff, great place to create trust foundation with customers."
good,"While I enjoyed working for Publix for five years, towards the end of my time their management guy really downhill and they promoted people that did not deserve it. But overall it’s a great place to work."
good,"If you like people and working hard this is the job for you. Don't expect to hear you are doing a good job, you only find out when you have an evaluation. There needs to be more coaching, but it also depends on your relationship with your upper management. Publix needs to allow new managers to complete their training."
good,"Once you get into Publix you are there as long as you want to keep working there. The pay is pretty good, and the benefits are great. Be sure to commit."
good,"People and co workers are nice but management, very very cruel played favorites and only bumped those they liked personally not those suited for the job."
good,Overall not a bad place to work all my coworkers are usually friendly. The store manager can be very passive aggressive. A typical day at work for me is bag customers groceries and get carts from the lot along with a small amount of cleaning usually just a few of our registers.
good,"Publix is a great company to work for if you are going to go down the retail path. there is a lot of opportunity for growth. unfortunately like everything, if you know someone with in management, your most likely getting promoted over someone who doesn't with the same credentials."
good,It's a nice place to work depending on your managers. The customers are difficult sometimes because our policy is so relaxed but it trains you to be a good customer service rep.
good,"Not a bad place to work, however after 5 years there,  felt as though I was under-appreciated and they treated me as though I wasn't important and could be replaced any time"
good,If you enjoy working with the public Publix is the place for you. In my years working at Publix I've learned the complexity of working in the grocery industry.
good,You help customers fine their groceries or you can help walk their groceries to the car. You have to stock up the shelves with two or everything in the store.
good,"Publix is a good place to work if you can work with many different people of many different capabilities. It also requires being on your feet for a considerable amount of time in a shift, as well as a ready smile. A typical day at work did not exist for me because I was cross-trained as a cashier, so I would switch back and forth between positions. The management is understanding and fair, although there is a fairly high turnover, both in management and in associates. The hardest part of the job is remaining positive and focused on customers even when you are having a bad day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the kids that come through with their parents. I enjoy playing peek-a-boo with them."
good,This company is a great place for people who are new to the work force to start at. They are flexible with hours to help work with students and other conflicts with scheduling. Great working culture as accompany.
good,"Publix can be a good place to work depending on what you make of it. Depending on your department you're able to come to work and leave without taking your job home with you. I learned some good skills working there as far as customer service goes. Management is descent but could improve on teaching associates more hands on. The culture is nice if you have lively coworkers that are accountable for their job. If everyone is on the same page this job is smooth sailing. Hard pats of working a Publix could be dealing with difficult customers or working during the holidays. Things I enjoyed while working there is the fast placed duties that made a full day of work seem quite short. It's a great place to work If you're planning to finish or go to college, as they have flexible hours."
good,"I like this company. Working life is good here. I am working in this a sqa contractor and my project may end soon, so, I have to find a new position. Also I am looking something local now."
good,I have enjoyed this job because I love people.  I truly provide great customer service by listening to the needs of the customers.  I am responsible for bagging groceries and walking the customers out to their vehicles.  The hardest part of the job especially at a high volume store is the physical aspect of keeping shopping carts out of the parking lot.
good,"Regular fixed busy hours"
good,The workplace can be stressful and fast paced. The culture varies from store to store. The hardest  part of the job is working with/ around the people who dont want to work. This job requires a lot of team work.
good,"•	Preparing and serving meal samples to customers"
good,"Overall, a good company to work for. Fellow associates are great and most of the managers are amazing. The hardest part of the job was/is dealing with irate customers. I learned a lot about working with the public."
good,"Wouldn't recommend working here. Management wasn't great, lunch breaks were very short. Only pro is you getting paid weekly instead of bi-weekly. And you got no employee discount! You pay full price for ever in store, you couldn't even get a drink from the endless fountain without getting fired."
good,"The main things were getting little to no hours at times. When you did it was 20 at most as a part timer. The managers are okay l. Customers, up and down hours are the cons but they tend to change. Recommend for college students, retires or just a side job just cause."
good,"The benefits are good, the payscales are fair, our customers enjoy the experience we offer and management is usually able to make arrangements regarding scheduling when the need arises."
good,Great place to work and would recommend for a person starting to work in the work force   All that is needed is a hard worker will do work there way up.
good,"I did what I enjoy doing; cooking.  Worked with a great team.  The hardest part of the job was standing on my feet for long periods.  The most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers.  Typical day consisted of preparing and cooking meals.  Preparing samples for customers, and clean up; at least 3 times per shift during the week; 5-6 on weekends."
good,was a good place to start working at i would recommend it to younger people only problem is its hard to get any full time employment and the management has a problem of hiring from without instead of promoting from within to the only full time positions.
good,"After a year of working at Publix, the customers are a double-edge sword. You have friendly customers, and you've got unfriendly ones too. But a little help usually goes a long way. Working with co-workers is a good experience. Management is good too. The job isn't too stressful, and it could be fun at times. Publix is a nice place to work, and a good starting place for a first job!"
good,"Overall a good company to work for, great benefits. That job teaches you a lot more than just bagging groceries. Just gotta find the right life/work balance."
good,"the management was terrible at the time that i was a part of Publix. it wasn't until after i left that they actually fixed what was going on, it was a good first job though"
good,This company is a great company to work for if you're employed as a full-time employee.  Compensation is minimal for part-time employees.  Management is very professional and supportive.
good,Working here has its ups and downs. Good benefits but schedules are inconsistent every week. No set schedule. Management is good for the most part however there are a few bad eggs. most associates are friendly and great to work with.
good,"I go in and do my job as required, opening for production, assisting customers with the produce they wish to purchase, whether is be cheese or deli meat.  Online easy orders are made as they come in to be made. Working the hot bar for a customers order.  Frying chicken and cooking sides."
good,"I enjoyed working for Publix. I loved dealing with customers. I also liked do my work in excellence. Working in the deli was  a great experience., making new dishes was always exciting."
good,"The staff and guests kept this job fun. Management worked ALONGSIDE you as a team. There was a puke spill, and my manager cleaned it up by hand instead of calling on a bagger/cart attendant to do it. This speaks volumes about publix's policy over other stores. The only problem I had was the limited raises."
good,"Publix can be wonderful or horrible depending on leadership. If you have a manager that genuinely cares about staff and actually works themselves then it is a great place to be."
good,I would recommend someone to work here.  They were accommodating when I needed time off and also when I asked for more hours.  The benefits were good for part time employment.
good,"Managers held favoritism when it comes to career advancement. Coworkers drop out to make it harder for others, but don't have consequences. There needs to be less favoritism for everyone to equally be team players. People need to advance in the company for the loyalty that they have, not the friendships that they have. False promises to workers that they'll advance in the company is the reason why workers relocate away from the company. There are people who walk around with cell phones uncaught and people who spend hours in office chatting with the managers to avoid doing their job, but they get promoted even when they slack off at supervising and problems arise."
good,Overall a great company to work for. The department I worked in was very stressful and fast paced. The management team was good by changed frequently.
good,They expected too much with little to no training (personal experience). No longer care for employees or customers like before. They only want you to push more product on the customer. Orientation use to focus on how you can help the customer and about the wonderful Publix culture. Now they show you how to properly examine a customer and their basket so you know what items to suggest that they buy. It makes me sad to see how far the company has fallen.
good,in my personal opinion I think Publix is overall a pretty good place to work for most. Good benefits and nice people but for me I just have a different vision on how work should be done.where I would like to work this somewhere I legitimately feel I could grow with the company
good,"Working for Publix was a good opportunity until I reached age 64,then I was fired so part timers could take my place.If you start with Publix at a fairly young age you will have good opportunities for advancement."
good,"Being a grocery stock clerk can be a bit demanding at times.  There is more responsibility than working up front as a bagger or cashier.  Sometimes you will be the only person working on the grocery floor as a stock clerk so you will have some customers that ask you questions.  Overall it's a good place to work, especially as a part-time job or first job for some youngsters."
good,"Before applying at Publix, I considered the grocery store a relatively upscale store due to its reputable status and clean nature. After working at the store, I realized that there are no lies behind it. The employees are all friendly and we clean the store very frequently so that the store remains neat. We have a policy ""don't pass it up, pick it up"" which just means if there's one tiny thing on the floor, pick it up; it'll help the store seem that much nicer. "
good,Typical day at work was boring most of the time. I learned some things but not much. Management wasn't the best. Good workplace. Memorization was hard. The friendships that were made was good.
good,"I would suggest working for Publix. Overall, Publix is a good company. Great benefits. It is a fast paced environment and very high demanding. Can make a career from it and move up."
good,Good job to get you through college or high school. Could be good if you plan to stay long-term. Opportunities for promotion are pretty good. I was satisfied working there.
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Publix. Great managers, great staff. There was little to no room for promotions. Flexible hours. Great for students in school."
good,"The company has changed a lot over the years. Customer service was always top priority. Understaffing on a daily basis has made it harder to continue that tradition but yet they still wanted us to render more,  with less help.  It is more about ""numbers"" on a spreadsheet now than quality work.  Promoting associates into management that do not have enough time experience. Took away bonuses for part timers (which are still shareholders), which left many with less incentive. Make it hard to reach your 30 hours a week to get your healthcare. Full timers get sick days, but you have to be near death to take them. Vacation coverage in the pharmacy was impossible to take because we didn't have enough technicians to cover for you. Becoming like other big corporations out there.  Still a decent company to work compare to what's out there, as long as they keep their stock private and decide not to do public trading."
good,"In my short time of employment with Publix, I have both noticed the good and the bad with he company.  The benefits are great, however the main benefits are for full-time associates.  This can be tedious as you have to prove yourself and may take at least 6 months if there is an opening.  Which in turn can be hard for someone wanting to transition into the company.  Also as for trying to get into management where the major benefits and pay is, it is very competitive, and I mean that with sincere word.  there is a lot of competition with not only around multiple stores, but also possibly at your own.  Yes, the pay is very good, but the hours are all over the place and you have to have an open availability in order to be considered for full-time. There are still more pros and cons, however this is the the basics of it."
good,"this is a good company to work for, working as a part time associate is not fun because you don't have any benefits. But  to be a  full time worker there it not something easy to get."
good,Publix is a great way to get your foot in the door with work experience. They have great fresh departments that have specialized job classes where you can get experience to move onto something better. It provides great benefits but it can be very hard to get full time here.
good,"the problem with publix is they have you doing a 4 men job by your self..you have to be super fast and efficient with your work .. the down side is that if your are not full time when season ends so does your hours of work,,"
good,"good first job, learned a lot on how a big company works, management was relaxed and engaged, most enjoyable part was the customers, generally nicer customers."
good,Pharmacy is a very fast paced profession with a lot of demands from management and customers.  Must be detail oriented and able to work quickly and accurately.
good,"I worked for Publix for five years before being written up for the first time, for .07 hrs of overtime (4 mins). I would go back to work if I could work at a different store."
good,this company thrives off of high schoolers and college kids. Flexible schedules and stocks are the only reasons that makes this job worth having. Being nice all the time is stressful.
good,"I love the environment at Publix, the coworkers are friendly and most the managers are easy to get along with. The downside is career advancement, unless someone at the top is fighting for you to advance, it won't happen. Also, getting full-time is difficult because it's cheaper to hire more part-timers than pay full-timers for vacation time and benefits. If you can afford to live off the minimal salary because you live with your parents, then working your way up the ladder is possible given enough time. It's not so great for those of us who have to support ourselves ."
good,A lot of small orders being in a college town. Had to deal with a variety of people and personalities. Staid open later than most others and have to have patience with students.
good,It is a good company but I want more with my life. Man0isnot properly trained and the upper brass is becoming less connected with the average worker. Publix has to get back to its roots.
good,"it was a good active place to work as a team with great benefits, with great communication. I would come in at 12pm get all my product together to stock"
good,I had fun working there. Some of the people there are awesome and always willing to help you out. You never have to work the whole day. You have more then enough time to spend with your family.
good,"I like working for   publix cause they paid out vacation and they provide a lot of overtime then earn raise every year ,it's a very nice company with a lot of opportunities to work for."
good,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time working as a Produce Clerk at Publix, although I would like to have better managers, and better opportunities to move up in the company, but quite honestly I can't complain. They've given me a fair pay and  a good, safe and clean work environment. The hardest part of the job for me would be cutting fruit, because it's the most stressful. It's not that the work is hard, it's just so stressful that it makes my day much less enjoyable than it would be if it wasn't. My most enjoyable part of the job would be my coworkers. They all have good heads on their shoulders, and are very easy to get along with. If I needed something throughout the day I could easily walk up to any one of them and ask for their assistance. Overall Publix isn't a bad job."
good,what i loved about publix the most is how its so important the impression it makes on its customers and how working there shows you how to increase your customer service skills. Publix is dedicated to its customers.
good,not where I plan to work much longer due to not my type of work and lack of fairness towards employees. Not the job for me and not my lifelong job either..
good,"It's a great place to work for just starting and retirings employees. You can move up in the business, but it all depend on you and how you treat others. Each publix employees/management  will treat you differently no matter if they say they treat everyone with respect and or caring for everyone, let's think realistic. Your experience will depend on how you act and think."
good,Want too much for little pay. Customers are very impatient. Its usually busy. Others employes are really friendly and nice. I enjoy working with other that's what make the job go by.
good,"Pleasant but hard work, Publix takes pride in customer services so you better believe that comes 1st. You better drop everything for a customer. Most customers are greatful for your help, others not so much."
good,"Co workers are fun,  management is good,  not very good pay though.  The highest raise you get is $.25 every 6 months of work.  Very hard to move up in this company."
good,Overall good company to work for. Associates become more like family. A wide verity of jobs to look into. Great benefits such as insurance and 401k including part timers. Employee owned company.
good,"Very fast paced environment making subs, slicing premium deli meat, completing online food orders and slicing cheese. I learned how to slice cheese, make specialty cheese dishes and platters for events. Management is okay but could communicate more.The unique thing about my job is that we have a variety of everything and the best quality of any competitor. The hardest part of my job is having to complete online orders and serve customers at the same time.The most enjoyable thing is the customers."
good,"A typical day as a front service clerk (bagger) consists of bagging groceries, walking customers to their car, retrieving carts from the parking lot, helping customers locate products in the store and answer any questions, as well as cleaning duties, and the occasional opportunity to acquire skills as a cashier. I have learned all about providing premier customer service, and how to communicate with my customers effectively. Generally in the workplace, the front end team is more like a family once you find your place. Almost everyone is helpful and managers are always supervising and able to answer any complicated questions,etc. The hardest part of the job would be the cleaning duties in my opinion. Although getting to know regular customers and meet people from all walks of life daily make up for the harder days."
good,"I got experience of having led the department without supervision of a manager. Exceptional customer services skills, dedicated to high levels of customer satisfaction and meeting aggressive business goals"
good,You will be busy all day and having to do a lot at one time.  Management can be difficult to deal with.  Coworkers aren't always motivated by normal means.
good,"Unload trucks , load the shelves with products , help customers , load the trucks back up , organize the store make sure it is neat and clean. Help the customer out the best you can."
good,I enjoyed my job at Publix. I worked in the fresh food section. My boss was very good to me. I loved the hours that I worked. It was a fast paced job that kept me interested.
good,Publix is a good company because has a great stock purchase plan and a good 401k.   Therefore people who works there has to be ready to work holidays.
good,Managers were professional and the company pays fairly well. My only complaint is the excessive micro managing but other than that it's a great place to work.
good,"I would take care of returns and do money services , example cashing checks, management is good for the most part, like working with my associates, the hardest was having to do floor care, the most enjoyable celebrating peoples retirements or transfers"
good,A typical work day was the same every day. It was very customer service centered. I learned how to provide customer service to all types of people. Management lacked something to be desired in some cases. The culture was that of trying to be productive and customer centered. The hardest part of the job was dealing with disgruntled customers who were difficult on purpose. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my co-workers.
good,"A typical day at work is where you always maintain a customer comes first attitude, creating a palatable atmosphere for everyone to enjoy their shopping experience."
good,Job can be as great as the management around you. There are places to advance in the smaller departments. Paid weekly.Stock available once you are full time and work 1000 hours a year.
good,I love it there but I was only seasonal. I had fun with my boss and coworkers they were great still talk to them to today. But they dont pay enough. Too bad.
good,I worked for Publix for several years and worked ion many areas of the store. I was very flexible in areas. Work load could get very busy and heavy at times. Fast pace and always positive customer service .
good,"Publix is a great place to work. People meet diverse workers and different managers who care about their value. The most memorable moment for me was the day my manage took me to lunch for doing an excellent job. He talked to his boss how dedicated I was to perform my duty. I had some hard time at first because I was not exposed to the procedure before. However, my manager assisted me and provided some information."
good,I enjoyed being a customer service representative at Publix through high school. I switched departments to try the bakery at a fast-paced store and was not given proper training.
good,Publix is an awesome company. They give you a reasonable amount of hours. if you keep up the great work then you move up faster. My job experiences started with publix and i learned to be more responsible.
good,"Coming into work is not exactly easy going depending on the hour, majority of the time you are working. But as long as you focus on what you gotta get done, and make your day more enjoyable with your coworkers, time will fly."
good,I worked at Publix for 13 years with 9 of the being in management. Great benefits but hard to manage work/life balance when in management. 50 hours a week and you will work most weekends.
good,"Love it, has great benefits as well as co-workers. Also has free lunches for the workers. The pay is great as and we get stock in the company. Overall great place to work."
good,Great place for teens to start off working. It's a good company to work for but hard to advance if you're in a smaller store. I can't see myself working here for the rest of my life
good,Really good place to work and grow I've made a lot of customers happy Working here everyday is a good day at publix 😌 I kinda wanna go back because I miss working there
good,"This was my high school job for 2 years. While it provided income for a basic job, it was very demanding and at times may not have been worth it. If I wanted to move up however this would have been a good company as the company does take care of people who stay there for a while."
good,"That's not just the company slogan. It really is a great place to work, so long are you're customer driven with flexible hours. Can be frustrating but benefits are a plus"
good,"great place to work, very friendly company. never had a bad experience with them. the only reason i am leaving is because i am only part time and i am looking for fulltime"
good,Most enjoyable part is establishing good relationships with customers. I have been able to develop great rapport with many of my clients and some of them just want me to service them instead of other colleagues.
good,I enjoyed my job.  I learned a lot with this company.  I worked my way up to manager.  The people were easy to work with and can be fun.  Working their hours was the hardest part of management.
good,This was my first job and it was a really great experience. I still shop at the Publix I worked at previously. I only and one bad experience with a manager but other managers were great.
good,"I worked here in the deli. The work here is very busy, especially if like me, you worked in the kitchen preparing hot food. The pay was not terrible, more than you will get at most grocery chains. I was part time but usually netted at least 30 hours a week which was fine with me. Moving even laterally in this company takes years, don't expect to get a promotion or pay increase in your first, even second year. The company only promotes within which is nice, as that means no outsider is coming in to steal your management spot you've been eyeing, with the exception of pharmacy as those are licensed managers."
good,Associates and management really took time out to work with you and genuinely cared for one another. Working here was honestly a pleasure. I would recommend anyone to work here.
good,"Great company to work for whether for a summer or many years. Many benefits emerge as you work through the company, exposure  to the interworking of a fortune 500 company is critical for anyone getting started"
good,"The job itself is great, I come in, I work, I go home. This isn't a job that takes up every moment of my life. On the negative side. I have been there three years now, and am often neglected. I often see newcomers receive first dibs on available shifts and earn more hours than I do now. It is quite unfair. Also, my managers tend to criticize me until there are higher ups visiting. They often put on a mask to make everyone seem like working here is so much better than it actually is."
good,"The  atmosphere at Publix was fun, positive, and uplifting. There was not a single person I worked with that wasn't friendly. Publix is a great company to work for as they offer a lot of good benefits. With Publix, you can work your way up from the bottom and possibly become a manager if you wanted to!"
good,"- Easy work, a lot of cleaning up behind other employees."
good,"Cutting fresh fruits and vegetable daily for catering trays, and bowls. Replenishing shelves, all while providing assistance to customers. While working at Publix i have acquired safe handling skills, sanitation skills, time management, and knowledge of various produce."
good,"It is a nice place to work, but their requirements for full-time work conflict with my personal life. I need a career, not a job. I have also worked in customer service."
good,Publix is a great place to kickstart your transition to adulthood and is known for there benefits. Publix offers great opportunities to advance in customer service.
good,A typical day at work is you're always on the run. There's plenty of opportunity to move up and the culture here is wide. Customers are treated like family here and it does feel like a family. Good company to work for.
good,This was a nice place to work during my college years. They were very flexible when I need off time. They move management around quite a bit.
good,Working there isn't bad at first. The problem is that publix feels like it is necessary to change mangers and relocate them every 3 to 4 months. This makes it hard to get hours.
good,"I loved my job at Publix as far as the job was concerned, but the management was selective in who they likes and wanted to promote. I worked there for almost 4 years and did not get to promote to cashier till almost my third year. There was never room to promote within the store. They had to many employees so they could offer 10 hours a week. I couldn't make enough money to buy a vehicle or attend college. I realized after 3 years it was time to move on and find a job that offered more room for growth and potential."
good,"Good benefits for college students. Competitive pay. Unstable Hours, multiple times they had us stay til 12 am then show back up at 5 am to open the store. Customers were one of the best parts of my job there, most of them were friendly."
good,pay is very good..hours is also very good..co workers are satisfactory..everyone is a team member..health and vacation benefits are excellent!!
good,if you want to advance and make a decent amount of money you have to wait longer than normal to even be considered for management. there are so many other people pushing for management that even if you are aggressive and persistent it takes too long. someone can only make $10 an hour for so long before they see the need to seek a higher pay.
good,"Great people work there . everyone is friendly and nice , some however aren't so friendly and nice . Customers are really great and nice most are regulars who continuously come back . overall great place to work with some of the best employees ."
good,"A typical day at Publix was ringing up purchase items and completing transactions. Also, keeping the isles clean and blocked in between customer transactions and after closing."
good,"You are on your feet for eight hours. If a customer walks down the isle you are working on, you are supposed to stop what you are doing, walk up the customer, smile, and ask if they need help finding anything."
good,Company is dedicated to premium customer service and high qualityproducts.  I learned to consistently and efficiently produce bakery goods each day while putting the customer first.  the hardest part of the job was standing/walking 8 hours a day.  The best part was the teamwork toward the common goal of premium service.
good,Publix is a great place to work if you are a high school or college student. They are very flexible and understanding. Though you will come across rude customers the nice ones out weight that. Great coworkers and staff in every department.
good,i worked for publix for about 3 years received great benefits and was paid fairly. co-workers were very nice and pleasant to work with. publix is a great stepping stone
good,you get what you put into it. Customers are kings and queens. they ALWAYS come first. Not much to say. Co-workers are vets. alot of benefits in the long run
good,Publix is a fine company to work for. They care about their employees and try to make the workplace a family environment.
good,"A great place to work full-time and for moving up, but part-time is a large workload and stressful. Management is very hands-off and expects part-time to fulfill a role of a full-timer."
good,"Limited growth opportunities. I enjoyed working in the food industry. I worked in the meat, deli, and customer service dept. Many of the employee's were on a part time basis including myself."
good,"This is a demanding field.  You must be good at following rules and doing exactly as told.  When you know what you are talking about, helping customers is very rewarding.  The benefits and pay are much better than other companies in the same industry."
good,I have learned a lot about working with the public and how to work with others here.  Management is very good about working with college schedule.
good,"""Where shopping is a pleasure."" Publix's motto. Management stresses this concept a bit too much. Oftentimes forgetting about the well-being of the associate. The company cares about the associates and offers benefits, but most, if not all interaction is done at store level. The company has great ideals, but I do not agree with some of the policies. Dress code is incredibly strict."
good,"Teachers great leader ship and problem solving skills in order to maintain proper skills on being a cashier."
good,I think that Publix is a great place to work if you have good management in your department. Coworkers are generally happy to be working there as well which makes the work environment easier.
good,"A good place to work,  room for advancement,  and good benefits..  Over all good place to work and build a career and move up in the company.  Great experience with customer service"
good,"-the best thing about working there is customer service "
good,"Great company, excellent benefits, flexible hours. Difficult to get full-time right away. Job can be very physically taxing. Weekend/Holiday work gets old, especially if spouse works M-F."
good,There is room for advancement but it takes a long time to do so. You are on your feet all day so be sure you have on comfortable sturdy shoes.
good,"I enjoyed meeting and servicing the public, this was a part-time position with a quality employer,  however the scheduling was spasmodic.  The uniforms were great. The training was sufficient."
good,Would work and manage the cash register & money while i assist customers with finding items. While helping co-workers ( stockers & baggers )  find and correct the rite prices ( coupons /sales / discounts ) help assist the baggers in packing the food products. My co-workers where very helpful towards making & speeding up the long grocery line  to help frustrated customers.
good,I learned that it's better to look busy than actually be busy. Make sure you are not more than 4 minutes late or else it will prohibit you from getting a raise.
good,Love the employees they really help you through everything and supervisors are understanding. Just which they never cut-back my hours really loved the company.
good,Publix is a great place to work especially while in high school or college. There are also several departments to choose from.
good,Everyday I'm usually surrounded by very friendly customers and very helpful coworkers and management. This is a great job and I enjoy working with the people that shop at Publix and the associates I work with.
good,"It was a great workplace to work at, the co--workers were very friendly and helpful. I loved the friendly customers who always made your day."
good,"Retail work is usually a struggle, but I loved every minute of Publix. The type of day you have really depends on who is supervising that day and who works with you during your shift. All the managers are great."
good,"My job at the pharmacy involves constantly checking queues to ensure accurate workflow balance. I am the most experienced technician and find myself solving many problems throughout the day. Problems include: insurance rejections, overrides, product availability (due to ordering), requesting refills from doctors, and correcting directions or day supply for prescriptions. Also I complete all data entry on all prescriptions, fill all medications, and check out customers. Along with the previous duties I can order pharmacy supplies, inventory, and process returns of inventory. I get along with everyone in my work place and we have a fun day while working. I like to teach people how to navigate the computer to better the workplace. I understand how the program works and how to achieve good numbers necessary to satisfy corporate's expectations."
good,Publix is an associate based company and takes care of you. retirement is great. overall good atmosphere. will always be a demand for groceries. good job security.
good,Publix had by-laws used by the company for termination. They used children underage for tricking you with alcohol and tobacco sales. They told us to store the purchase if the person didn't have I d until they returned with one.  It could have been a trap.
good,"Everyday there was something new that came up and that's what made it fun. Friendly people everywhere you went and at times, a fast paced work zone that kept everyone on their toes to get the job done."
good,All and All This is a great place to work. Once you start working This place seems to consume you and your life outside is very little for time to yourself.
good,Management was average. There was a lot of favoritism in the workplace. I enjoyed being around and helping so many people but this was really just a job for me while I was going through high school and secondary school.
good,"I am able to be customer focused and pay big attention to detail. I can find creative solutions to problems and can work with a diverse group of people. I am highly organized and independent, and can also work well in team environments."
good,"Publix is a great company to work with. Excellent safe and evironment place."
good,I enjoyed working there but unless  you are willing to make an invasive personal identity sacrifice and lifestyle commitment to the company they aren't  keen on promoting the quality of pay for their part time associates. Be ready to move up or keep them just on the weekends.
good,Giving customer service at its finest. Working with others that want to display that same customer service. Helping others together.
good,the management is good and you meet some great people. You learn great life lessons and plenty of techniques and information to help you in future opportunities.
good,"I had to get product from slots, off a headset and take them to the correct loading dock. Hardest part was the stacking and getting used to it."
good,"Not a tough job, just heavily labor driven. Hard work for little pay. Given freedom as long as you complete your tasks by night's end, as well as what your managers ask."
good,This is a big grocery chain that is very big at promoting within the company. You will be working on weekends and holidays.
good,The staff is generally friendly and most everyone wants to do well. The managers listen to their employees and do what is best for the company.
good,"Not a bad place to work, just the pay is not enough for me for all the work I have been doing."
good,Publix is a good company to work for but the work is monotonous. It's hard to move up in departments because everybody else wants to as well but they have good benefits are are very flexible with scheduling.
good,"Efficient customer service, clean areas, consist moving, safe environment, good manager supervisory. very pleasant feeling for pleasing customer"
good,Publix was a very fun place to work. At times it would get crowded but their motto is that the customer comes first. It feels like a family working here. The benefits are extremely amazing if you're working full time.
good,"It was a very nice environment where i interacted with many customers and got to learn them by name, I also got to learn and know the employees as well."
good,I have learned since working at Publix how to demonstrate premier customer service and ways to deal with conflicts of interest that may arise within the workplace.
good,"Great and friendly managers and employees. Customers are usually easy to deal with but can be difficult at times. Publix is willing to work around their employees' schedules, which is great for those in school."
good,This organization has been very kind and patient with me.  The management will work with any productive student's schedule to provide a comfortable yet mutually beneficial experience for both you and Publix (especially if you are considered part-time).
good,samething as I post on my publix review it is a nice job to have at a young age and understanding easy to get along with the co workers nice place to work and everything
good,"publix is a great placate work, my only issue was the managers only looked out and cared for themselves. our grocery manager told us to pass every coupon customers gave us, but when corporate found out and got angry of the matter, he let cashiers get fired for his mistake."
good,"Co-workers are amazing, customers love you, management is friendly. One of the top companies to work for in America, plus you can buy as many stocks as you want with company!"
good,The typical restaurant environment. The food there is great so it makes waiting tables there easier and you can give you honest opinion of the recipes.
good,I enjoyed the Publix culture and the people working there were awesome. I recommend Publix as a great high school or college job.
good,Friendly and provides pay increases with performance. Very well ran company and many opportunities to climb the ladder of management.
good,Great place if you are looking for a summer job or income during school. Set your own availability and frequently work with great management.
good,"Mainly a professional work environment with some exceptions. As a company, Publix is a great choice for students especially; they're very flexible with their scheduling and even offer to pay for some college, however it isn't always the most reliable source of income for an independent student or adult living on their own because hours and scheduling can be very inconsistent and pay is not within living range. I learned many skills in just a few short months of being a Deli Clerk; food safety and sanitation methods, food preparation, time management, customer service, sales techniques such as companion selling and upselling, and a wide range of product knowledge. The hardest part of working in the deli is how dirty the job can be, but the best part is the people I work with and having the opportunity frequently to meet and interact with customers."
good,"A very customer friendly environment. I never knew what I was coming into in the morning, so I had to be flexible and ready. I enjoyed the morning banter and self paced start. I'm a very detail oriented person and my work reflects the same. The hardest part of the job was finding time to stay updated on specific corporate issued training modules. Never enough scheduled time in the day. I was very fortunate to work under very qualified associates and was able to draw from their experience. The most enjoyable part was the team mentality in accomplishing the days goals. Everyone tried very hard to work cohesively to achieve what was required."
good,I loved the co-workers I worked with. Some of the management showed favoritism. The most enjoyable part was when it gets busy.
good,Enjoyed interacting with many different kinds of people and getting to know them personally. Very busy environment and was dependable in supplying enough work hours.
good,"Publix is a strong company They are extremely competitive in today's pharmacy industry.Daily routines were very busy and many tasks were expected from all staff members. They offered plenty of up to date education required to maintain current professional and managerial expectations. There were good and great co-workers I dealt with.  Personalities of each were both easy and not so easy to work with. I believe the hardest part of working with Publix was dealing with juggling the many tasks per daily schedule upper management required me to accomplish. Program initiatives were understandable however the times allotted to accomplish all the tasks were limited. In my opinion, juggling patient care programs versus daily business requirement did not seems to be balanced. Working with and caring for each patient was and still is the most enjoyable thing about my working in pharmacy"
good,"Constant steady work, new tasks quite often good work pace motivated environment willing to help with any task at hand without criticism."
good,"An very nice place to work.Good enviroment and the general manager are very good ,they listen to you in a very patience manner and they are quick to find a solution to your needs.The only negative is that they need to hire more full time employees so the motivation and  retention of the employees increase."
good,"The managers and associates at Publix are wonderful. They are all very helpful, respectful, and fun. Everyone works as a big team and the communication over all is good. Everyone is pushed to be their absolute best that they can be and if that does not happen as a team we help that person success. Moving up in the company is very easy and they always recognize their employees for doing their best. However, in any business there are sometimes communication issues but this can happen at any place of business."
good,Great company to work for.  They are very accommodating to students and their changing schedules.  I work in pharmacy but it seems as though all departments have great employees working there.
good,"No two days were the same, with the customer base constantly growing, but the quality of service had to be consistent. The departments all worked together to give each customer the best possible experience. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and sharing brief fun encounters with new people every day and, of course, seeing them leave with a smile!"
good,"The Publix environment is one that allows for advancement among those that work hard for it. It teaches customer service while striving to reduce overall costs. The other team members are, for the most part, positive individuals that care about the customer and one another."
good,"Working at publix is fine for a first job, flexible with scheduling. good first job while attending school. however it is not a good job to make a wage that works in today's economy."
good,"Good people and good work environment.  The management is very encouraging and plenty of room to move up within the company which is encouraged so long as you are not working in the pharmacy.  Also, I was promised full time hours and after probationary period the hours have not been awarded.  I left a full time job at higher pay with an understanding I would be working full time after training period.  This is why I am looking for another job.  Publix is a great place for part time work.  Really good benefits as a part time employee."
good,The manager was very unsanitary. My manager would sell fish that was pass due or any meat that was ugly already I just didn't feel right to sell that kind of product to people and get them sick and possibly kill them.
good,Publix sets the standard for all other retailors. Employees should work for another company before coming to work at Publix so that they can realize what Publix has to offer.
good,"Fast Paced, Trying to maintain a certain quota of orders in order to keep your pay level. Its a very competitive job. The more orders and faster you select them the better you are paid. Felt like a Football Player!!"

good,An enjoyable experience where customers and employees are friendly on a daily basis. Some days are filled with questions and answering and others are more geared towards in-house work. Management was kind to work with and aiding when employees had troubles. The experience I have gained and learned was to respect clients and always work hard no matter the day.
good,"I did the batch processing and report distributing, I also serviced and maintained the mainframe systems. I took care of the backups and system defragmenting."
good,worked as customer care representative. Great first job. I moved and was not able to transfer to store close to my residence.
good,i love my coworkers! the managers could be a little more compassionate. its more based on favor-ability than ability. very flexible its easy to work and go to school. part-time employees are not guaranteed hours.

good,"Maintain the highest levels of customer care while demonstrating a friendly and cooperative attitude"

I loved getting paid every week. Being that I'm a small female, taking bags out to customers cars' was tedious and was sometimes scary to do at night. But overall I loved the job."
good,Working at Publix was a very nice atmosphere to be around. I enjoyed working with my fellow co-workers and learning about different opportunities about working for the company.
good,"At work I was an employee that was expected to be above my current status as a customer service and back office staff, I had to be a manager because the management we had did very little in trying to help customers and getting things done. My co-workers were good people to work with. One of the managers thought that she was better than everyone else there and did not like the fact that I did her job better than her and wouldn't lift a finger to help out myself or other of the customer service staff when they needed it, she just sat around to look pretty. I enjoyed working with our customers they knew that if they wanted something done they came to myself and a few others there."
good,"Publix has been a great company to work for. I am, however, looking for something that is closer to home and lets me use my artistic skills. I would like a job in the photography field."
good,"Responsible for efficiently processing and stocking in the grocery department, which includes dry food, frozen food, and diary food sections. Also responsible for unloading stock, reloading the salvage truck and maintaining the cleanliness of the department."
good,"First off any kitchen you work in is going to be stressful, that's the nature of the beast.  So,  managing customer and typicall day to day production (grab n go products, salads, sandwhiches) can make for a stressful shift.  The best part of working with Publix is the opportunities they provide you to advance.  You can make some great friends like I did, and build great relationships with customers.  Overall, this is an extremely great company to work for."

good,"A typical day will consist of me coming to work, clocking in and than my day begins. Co-workers were always enthusiastic and you can just feel the love as soon as you walk in. During that time i have gained great customer skills. This job taught me how to work well with others. I learned a lot about business and responsibilities. The hardest part of the job that i will say is leaving. I loved being at publix."

Other duties included greet and assist customers, removing poor quality product from shelves on a daily basis, maintained a clean work area at all times both in the cut- bar area, the backroom, cooler, and on the sales floor.

As needed, I provided written instructions for co-workers and management. Team work is a necessity in providing the wonderful customer service that Publix is known for. The most enjoyable part of the job was serving the customers  and their dependability and just knowing that they were getting what they wanted and needed and then some."

good,"My time at Publix as longer than many but in the end as much as I value the core values of Publix culture, it wasn't the place for me.  I worked in various departments, picking up skills and growing as I went but after 10 years I had gotten so mired down in trying to play a certain role that I couldn't clearly see what I need to do to advance and make Publix better."

good,"great people"
good,"I was the low man on the totem pole, as a Grocery Clerk. I worked there for two years, and I knew what I had to do every time I came in. But yet, everyday I came in, they always tried to yell at me and tell me what I needed to do that day, even though I knew what to do. There is a lot of drama in this company. People will stab you in the back, in order to receive a raise or promotion. I have seen some of the laziest workers in my life at this company. I would sometimes run laps around some of the other employees, and when I addressed the issue to management, all they had to say was ""We understand that they are slow and lazy, but at least we get a little bit of work out of them"", as I stood there drenched in sweat, realizing that this job was a dead end. Overall it was a great experience, you just have to have thick skin, and be able to take a rear end chewing every single day you come into work (even if you wear head phones to work). I learned a lot of customer service skills that I will be bringing with me to my next job. PUBLIX= Where Shopping is a Pleasure, and Working is a Nightmare !! Also, If you plan on having any type of life with this company, think again. You will work anywhere between 40-60 hours a week, and even more during the holidays. Low pay and hard manual labor for a measly $250 a week paycheck. Not worth it, in my eyes. Grocery stores are open everyday of the week (except Christmas and thanksgiving), other than those holidays, you will be there for about 10 hours a day. Also, the 401K plan they have isn't that good. They tell you to invest 100 percent into"

Ive learned that in this business the customer always comes first and they are always right. Being loyal to customers is a top priority; it helps sell the product an makes the customer corfortable and able to trust your judgement on products. The hardest part of my job has to be nothing because its always a laning experince and i can almost always figure things out on my own. i am a quick learner. the most enjoyable part of my job is being able to make specailties such as making delicious fruit bowls and making flower arrangements in the floral department.

What I learned is to be friendly to customers and helped them as much as I can, work wise, how to manage a backroom by cleaning as I work, straighten the shelves as I work and always being attentive to when products are low on the shelves. The managers are helpful; they inform us if we’re doing something wrong and help us improve. My coworkers help each other, when one is behind or needs more help. The hardest part of the day is when we have to make displays and have to make sure the store looks presentable before it opens. The most enjoyable part of the day is the satisfaction you get when helping a customer, also when I have worked hard and my manager acknowledges it."
good,"good people, good hours, decent pay. Higher management doesn't really care for their employees as individuals."

good,"My main foucs is to make the customer happy. I run the register, bag groceries and self check out."
good,I enjoyed working with some of the employees. I had some pretty bad experiences. Management was pretty poor. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone I know.
good,"Good job with ability to advance. Managers don't always listen to schedule requests though, even if they're emergent."
good,"Proficiently unloaded/loaded trucks, inspected inbound shipments for accuracy and quality assurance and maintained back room to maximize efficiency of stock control"
good,It was good experience. Dealt with an array of situations from technical difficulties in the office to customer related issues.
good,"I've had a great experience working with Publix. Customer relationship is the most important thing. A typical day at work for me is to begin by loading the shelves with merchandise, counting out of stocks, and securing inventory control."
good,"great company with awesome benefits, really nice work environment, great oppurtunities for advancement within the company"
good,You have to work at a fast pace sometimes and have great customer service skills
good,By working for Publix I was able to advance my communication skills and build relationships with its customer base. Management was very good in offering suggestions on handling situations with customers to not only resolve the problem at hand but also keep the customer happy in the end.
good,"my first job, learned a lot about customer service, also operating a cash register"
good,"A typical day at work is getting customer's groceries checked out and bagged. I've learned how to communicate with people better. The management is not that great, at least for customer service. I enjoy working with my co-workers. A lot of them are my age and go to the same school as me. The hardest part of the job is wokring long hours standing in the same place and dealing with rude customers. I enjoy meeting new people, sometimes you meet the nicest people."
good,"I believe the hardest part of the job is handling patients that are irate. collectively as a team we can efficiently take in, count out, and dispense medication. Also we must handle being the bridge for the patients and the doctors. I am used to high intensity and volume per day. 200 plus prescriptions per day can be smooth sailing if we all take initiative to notice what needs to be done and what takes priority. I love helping people and to have things ready prior to their arrival. To see their gratitude and appreciation is what makes my day. If I can assist at least one patient or even just a random person to help their day be easier that is enough for me."
good,The department depends on the type of work that you will encounter while on the job.
good,"good place to work for i would work again,everyone is nice and frendly and helpful employees to employees or employees to customers"
good,"Management could be a little better, with it's employee's, but overall I would recommend it to the young up coming teenager who really needs a job. All stores are not the same, some are much better than others, and now the pay has gone up since i left for Stock Clerks."
good,great company to work for. they really work with you on scheduling needs and really care about there employees.
good,"Being my first job, I enjoyed the ability to make money while in high school. Employees were trained to be innovative, very friendly, and efficient. I liked that!"
good,The managers are very personable and work well with their associates to gain the best results and performance from each individual. They are also flexible and understanding.
good,You begin your day with with a meeting that details the the day or nights workload followed by a group stretch. I learned other aspects of working ina warehouse. The workplace is very diverse and there is always opportunity for growth in a variety of job titles. Hardest part of the job is paying attention to your surroundings to avoid injury which isn't difficult and most enjoyable is the people you work with.
good,I started out as a bagger but I moved up to a cashier I liked the job a lot all though the back and feet pains were no joke customers were always happy I always had a good time there but I quit cause I wanted to do something else
good,"Overall was content with my time at this company. The work hours are constant, it was not uncommon to leave the store at 2am only to come back at 9am."
good,Publix is a great company to work for. It has flexible work hours. It also offers many opportunities for its employees to advance professionally. There are many positions that can suit most employment preferences.
good,"This is a GREAT COMPANY to work for, IF you put your time in for years. But if your like me and have a college degree in Business and get a job there you definitely wont get your college value/worth. Even having a Masters degree wont give you a higher a higher dollar starting pay."
good,Need to talk to employees like adult no talking down to them and explain n help them improve what not doing right. Nice people to work with. Pay is good.
good,"I enjoyed teaching customer's to cook different meals.  We had celebrity chefs come in, it was interesting to see how they taught a class.  I would cook up to a 5 course meal in front of customers then they were served one course at a time that had been prepared before hand."
good,They are great and the pay is well but trying to get into management can be confusing. They make lots of empty promises and unrealistic time frames for getting promoted.
good,"nice atmosphere, communication is good, pay for employees is decent. Work is steady from the moment you start to the end of your shift. the hardest part is the drive."
good,"- Management in the deli department didn't maintain a professional composure "
good,"The benefits from Publix are great the stock options,401k,health,dental and vision insurance are perfect. These options have helped me out tremendously the vision coverage saved me without glasses I can’t see and usually glasses cost an arm an a leg.I’m very happy that I’m covered by Publix and getting more out of the company than just being an employee."
good,"I had the time of my life working here! Great place to start in the work world. The managers are always willing to help you when needed, there are many opportunities to grow if you choose to stay, and you feel at home when you walk through the doors."
good,publix is an amazing place to work at i really enjoy working there even though its always busy but i do not mind helping our customers when i come to work i learn something everyday not only from my co-workers but also our customers. I will say the hardest part of the job is making sure the customers leave satisfied by finding every item that they needed in the store.and the most enjoyable part is being at the job!!
good,"A typical work day can be pretty stressful, due to the fact that we can be understaffed or just not having any help. However you learn to overcome those obstacles and work hard."
good,"I worked in the deli department. It’s fast paced at time and can be stressful, but I did enjoy working there. Management was always helpful, but I think there could’ve been better training in place. Expect an hour break and they don’t like you going over hours. Overall a wonderful place."
good,Needed more hours or maybe a stocking job Good people to work with.But I needed more money.Possibly would have liked to work in floral or warehouse or produce.
good,"Enjoyed working at the Pace location. It is an extremely busy "
good,"When I started working there over a decade ago, things were pretty good. Unfortunately, their management today has changed. Unequal treatment of employees, lots of favoritism. Young, pretty girls and men are treated better. A word of caution if you're going for a management job: once you've been there for years, they'll eventually find ways to fire you because the longer you're there, the more money you make and Public is a penny pincher."
good,"For me, a typical day at work meant bagging groceries for the whole day on weekdays and working with a lot of great associates.  It also gave me a chance to meet some great long-term customers that made me feel right at home.  However, the one thing that I did not enjoy was being the glorified janitor of the store on weekends.  For the past two and a half years I would come in and clean and maintain the store for them which is a position I did not sign up for at all.  I kept bugging management about cross-training and taking that next step up but all I got was nothing but excuses and delays on cross-training.  Week after week I would speak my mind about cross-training and taking a break from being a janitor and all they said was ""It's part of your responsibility.  Everyone has to do it.""  So not true!  They give it to me because I'm so good at it and that's all they want me to do.  They've broken their promises of advancement numerous times and I just had enough.  I want to work somewhere where I can advance and be valued in the company."
good,"Hours are decent as well as days, plus you get paid weekly so that is convenient. They have many options for investing and offer good opportunities to employees."
good,"A typical day consisted of maintaining inventory, cleaning, catering to customer's needs, re-stocking inventory, and the occasional special item request report."
good,Great company but not very understanding I think that for someone that had the issue I did with a coworker trying to lay hands on me wasn’t right for them to write us both up
good,"Work procedure is fairly simple, and the daily activities become the standard. I learned cash handling and customer service skills during my time there. Management is typically very nice. Workplace culture is very diverse and really depends on who you are working with. The hardest part of the job is the customers at times. The most enjoyable is the people you meet, along those same lines."
good,I just want an opportunity to prove myself! I know I have what it take to b a great chef I have just been to scared to take that leap. But i think it's time and i just want and need more!
good,Customer are the worst.. but the management team is great. You have to deal with a lot of inpatient people. Even if they see that all managers & works are with a customer they still complain.
good,"If you are a signal parent/sole provider or needing a set schedule have to pay a sitter and bills I don’t recommend working here. If you are available anytime 7 days a week and are ready to clim the ladder to management then go for it, but this will include scrubbing toilets yes you read that right be prepared to clean and be very motivated the whole process can take a year seen some take up to 2 years to get into management this is all at the grocery store side, not sure how corporate or distribution center run."
good,"Positive work environment, but increasing demands/expectations and no room for error. Pharmacists are allowed to make 10 mistakes (QREs) before they are suspended for a week without pay."
good,"Good company and good people to work for and with, but you have to be there awhile before you can advance. Even though you may have a ton of experience and more experience than some of the management team you still have to work from the bottom up. They also rarely terminated any one."
good,"Decent place to work, pay is good and so are benefits. Some days it felt not worth the trouble due to poor management and district managers persona. work environment was too stressful due to the associates attitudes. Associates were poorly disciplined so things would get out of hand too quickly between associates and customers. Not all stores are like this, but my last store was."
good,The days were long but the job was not hard. It was great getting paid weekly and the people were nice. The pay was not bad but it just was not enough.
good,Publix taught me important aspects of business and allowed me to advance at my pace. A lot of interpersonal skills are requested and Publix has helped me to maintain professional etiquette in all areas of business.
good,"management is alright, trying to find a set schedule so i can fully focus on school. Publix does not really care about your education, they rather you leave late than to go home and study. Publix is depending on your managers and some managers just don't care."
good,They take care of you in the long run but managers vary depending on the store or department some managers are lazy while others are excellent at there responsibilities
good,I walk in wait a bit till it was time to clock in. i began to bring in left over carts from the lot. After that I went to an open cash register and bagged the groceries of customers. I learned hard work and dedication pay off. The culture their was family friendly.
good,Its a good company but when it comes to family its not alot of time able to spend with them becauaw how the schedules are setuo and made. A good company though
good,"I was at work at 4:30 AM most days."
good,Publix a excellent first-time job because there training programs are excellent at teaching all the basics. Especially cashiering. Would recommend to anyone.
good,Fast pace environment. Publix is always trying to one-up the completion by applying new ideas regularly. Learned all my knowledge through the company and got registered with them. Most enjoyable part of my day is being acknowledged by a customer on my work. Most people only give feedback on negativity but its a win-win situation when a customer gives a compliment to you.
good,I really thought I would enjoy working here as I had heard great things when applying. Soon enogh I realized I never got to move up in the departments after being told I could and thn other individuals would move up without even wanting to.
good,"Since the only thing I did was front service clerk, it's only fair that I rate it on that. I'm sure if it was a place you actually wanted to climb the ladder at it's great. The only reason i'm leaving is I need to work somewhere or on something that will help with my career and future. It was a great first job to experience the working world for the first time and get my feet wet, provide some gas money, and get experience working with customers."
good,The store was located close to home. Lots of traffic to get to work. Lack of supervision for baggers and chairs. Hard to find supervisors. Good lunch area. Quality merchandise.
good,Publix is good if you want a career out of it but for someone who just wants a part time it can be too demanding. Managers aren’t consistent and can make your job harder than it should be.
good,"Worked 5 years, great pay, great benefits but no room to grow unless you know the managers personally and have a great relation with them. But if you not career minded and only want a paycheck with nice benefits , then this is the place to be."
good,"I applied at Publix under the impression that I was going to work Full Time to be told by the manager that the company starts all of its employees part -time... *The application asks Full Time, Part-Time, Full OR Part-Time and I selected FULL TIME. * There are employees that work 2 jobs there. Besides pay, The Publix I worked at was one of the most stress-free environments I've ever had to work. I also enjoyed those long breaks (most times 1 hour sometimes 45 minutes and sometimes 30 minute lunch breaks depending on your shift.) Everyone was kind and respectful got along with all of my managers and employees.  I would highly reccomend this type of employement for teenagers but for those with families, bills and rent, well you have been warned..."
good,Good job and management but they are too strict on newer employees. They should learn to accept doctor's notes. Life happens but it seems they dont care.
good,Had a great working experience and was paid well for my efforts. Worked hard for the advancements I have made. Little drama in the workplace and people were always great to be around and work with.
good,No comment.I prefer not to reply.This is my right.I choose not to say anything in this questionare.Response to the question is not happening at this time.
good,Great place place to work if you can get full time. Full time benefits are wonderful! Part time benefits sucks!!!                        ‐------------
good,The work is fast pace. The job isn't done till all stores have been selected or 5 which ever comes first. Management half the time doesn't know what is going on
good,"It would always get busy at certain hours, I was responsible for ringing up customers groceries. The managers weren’t always that nice but I got through. They write you up when your drawer is over or under. They’re very organized, they have us go from isle to isle organizing the shelves for customers."
good,"Relax work at your own pace, but get the job done atmosphere. "
good,"Publix was a fast paced workplace with certain requirements to be meet everyday. A typical day consist of throwing a truck, or back stock and making sure the store looks picture perfect for the next day. Management is usually very supportive and flexible and provides a strong culture built on teamwork. The hardest part of the job is blocking because it is so mind numbing. The most enjoying part of the job is working together with the crew and building good relationships."
good,Depending on the location of store and department you work in some of the management and store will work with employees but others like to throw their weight around and use giving you less hours whenever they feel like it and plenty of hours whenever they feel like it
good,"If you are working in the deli like i did, the job is hectic, fast paced, and busy from start to finish. If you work in any other position, it is relaxed and family like."
good,Great place to learn and set a great pace for the your future in the workforce. Several opportunities and benefits for individuals from all walks of life.
good,Great place to work but management is inconsistent in additud and work ethic advancement is not based off of skills and performance at times and new employees can be hired at higher rate of pay to people already employed
good,"Given I am only a college student and Publix was my first job as a high school student, I can say that the job was a high school job.  It was not one that could be made into a career but as a retail associate I could pay for college and build a savings account for my future needs.  I would recommend the job for teenagers who are looking for their first job"
good,Publix was fun to work at you stayed busy so the time went by fast.  Management was rude.  The benefits were really good.  You developed a relationship with the customers which was really nice.
good,It is a quick paced place of employment that makes you think on your feet. Your typical day wont have you looking at the time on the clock. You will be pulled in many directions from management to customers.  There is a friendly welcoming environment when working at Publix.  The hardest part of the job is keeping everybody happy.  You will not always be able to finish everything that you are assigned for the day.
good,"I enjoy customer service and cashiering so publix was the job for me. Flexible hours and good pay. Many of my coworkers complained about management, however I bonded with my superiors and they are always offering advice on how to better yourself and succeed in this line of work."
good,"If you love associating with hundreds of customers and potentially hundreds of work associates then this is the job for you. Work is just slow, there is definitely always something to do. You are definitely challenged daily with difficult customers and sometimes even difficult associates. Depending on the store you are at and the management you have it can be fairly easy to move up as long as you are willing to work hard and put some hours in. Publix definitely has the retail scheduling. Hardest thing is only knowing your schedule a week in advance and having to literally plan your life around it. Some people love it and some people don't. Publix provides great benefits and as you move your way up, great pay as well."
good,"Publix overall is a good company with many benefits, with the right management. For some people it is a very good job, but I am finding it may not be the best fit for me."
good,Loved working there management wasn’t always the best. Decorating for holiday was always fun. Early morning shifts decorating were my favorite shifts.
good,"Competitive pay for meat cutters and good benefits make this a solid company. However retail is not for everyone, and this could end up being a place you love or hate."
good,"Publix was a great company to work for. Everyone is friendly, it could be stressful but overall great place. Different department tend to get busier than others. Like the Deli Department is one of the busier ones"
good,"When a customer complained about me an done of my coworkers, management decided to pull them aside and tell them to stop talking to me. I was never notified or talked to about this incident, so it seemed as if they didn't care about the entire situation only blaming my coworker as to why the customer complained."
good,"Publix is a great grocery store with the best quality products to me. They have great benefits, slightly okay pay, if your just starting with chances to advance in your career with time. They have student reimbursement, loan options, car/home discounts through the company and other great perks. However, the store that I worked at, Worked you like nobody's business! We were always short in our department so we would work 1 day for 14hrs +..but always cut us at the end of the week to avoid over time pay. Our First manager was good at teaching, but had a horrible disposition towards the employees and job. This job is also very physical, so be warned, you'll be lifting heavy items all day. Scheduling was always bad, and the employee turnover is high. If you want to move up to a mangers position, its Publix as the priority in your life!!!...nothing else."
good,The employees are treated unfairly but the job is very easy as long as everyone is doing what they’re suppose to do. Management has favorites and the paying salary is fair but not enough.
good,An overall enjoyable place to be at. I never once had any real issues when being with the company. My current managers are amazing and I never have to worry about asking for something if I need it.
good,"Great co workers , the management does not appreciate their workers. Management is very judgemental. Deli managers are amazing.  Work with your schedule especially if you have family occasions."
good,"- Days are pretty Sometimes there’s insufficient amount of workers in almost every department in the most busiest times and days. I suppose management either believes the associates can handle it or they’re simply trying to save up more money. It does result in them overworking the people they consider knowledgeable or quick at completing assignments. Coworkers in my store are sociable, respectable, and sometimes funny. I can’t complain about management, it truly depends on the store environment and you just have to test the waters before judging and you can always transfer stores if the environment is toxic."
good,"Publix is always giving us more to do but not giving us more time to do it in. Each new thing is more extravagant than the last, not to mention the custom orders that have to be done a long with all the production for the day."
good,"I still work here, and I love it most of the time. You will always be short on your crew, you will always need a hand but you will never be able to have it because there is either not enough hired staff or no one is willing to come in. Call outs are constant. Reprimanding does not happen often, as some associates seem to get away with anything. Favoritism is constantly visible. You will work yourself to death it feels like. If you can not smile you will not make it anywhere."
good,overall the work is easy. if you work hard they will be happy to give you hours as you start off as a part-timer but if you are lazy you can kiss your hours goodbye. the only way you can advance or get benefits is be serious about making it into a career. i been there five whole years and have yet to become a full timer because I was in school and didn't have open availability. management makes good money but it is not easy to get there in my experience.
good,A typical day at work includes interacting with customers and dealing with the company's merchandise. I learned how to work together with my team and we all got along well. The management was fair at times but we made it work. The workplace atmosphere was very fast pace and it helped me learn to multi-task. The hardest part of the job was not having enough hours to work. The most enjoyable part about the job was interacting with the customers and helping them to make their experience at Publix a good one.
good,Publix was a great place to work when I was there you come in to do your job and then go home to your family. They have free lunch everyday hot cook meal for each and every coworkers. You have the opportunity to work at a different warehouse in the company or the store whichever you choose to do. The benefits  package are good if not the best I have ever had in a company. The management team just show up to make sure things are running smoothly other than that it's usually the Supervisor each and every day getting things done.
good,"A typical day is go in serve your customers, take care of product, and clean up. What I have learned is a many great things about how a super market is managed and learned to appreciate the people that work there and what they have to go through. Management is a hit or miss some managers are amazing and will be there to help you grow into your work space while others don't make you feel as appreciative and its more of a job where you are on your own without knowing what to do. You have a wide range of culture with people from all kinds of backgrounds some working just to keep busy, others to make a career, and those just trying to keep a steady job. The hardest part is either going to be the holidays with all the last minute customers or its going to be the customers that come in just to cause problems for just because they are unhappy. The most enjoyable part of working with publix happens after having worked there for a while. You will learn to know your customers and eventually become friends with them and get to know one another while enjoying each others company."
good,"the place is always cold in the morning, but there is always a smile waiting for you. nice and friendly place to work, people always try to help each other when they can."
good,I myself did like working there then managers decided to treat everyone poorly and I didn't like the managers decisions and the only thing I liked doing was closing
good,"You either work overnight or day stock. if you stay busy, the shift flies by. constantly checking over your section to fill items. store manager doesn't show appreciation or understanding of what grocery deals with. She's only concerned with her numbers."
good,They are a great company but they often try to keep good people in certain areas and that stalls your advancement. I’ve been on the management list for a year and I haven’t gotten promoted because they didn’t want me to leave the district.
good,I can say the only thing I didn’t like about the job is they made me shave my face without giving me an option to cover my face with hair net. Other than that great place to work
good,"I worked in the deli. It was always busy no matter what time, always something to do. It was very competitive in the fact of moving up in the company and very cut-throat. But the store managers were very involved in the way of the employees around them with offering employee of the month and competitions between the departments and offering luncheons."
good,They expect a lot from you so get ready to be stressed. Under value some of their associates. Extremely hard to get full time with the company. But as long as you’re doing your job effectively it will be easy to move up in positions.
good,stressful long hours sometimes without breaks. they  managers too quickly. district manager is awful and no one ever relays information. working here is okay but only if you can deal with a ton of stress and being treated awful at times.
good,Publix is a good place to work as far as to being involve with the customers. i enjoyed the learning about the different meats and giving advise between the publix brand or the booards head brand
good,Good place for a first job but not a place to seek a career. Plenty of hours to work but the pay was just not there for the tasks and time being put in.
good,The company asks a lot of its associates but does offer a promote from within culture.  Work time is all over the place which can be a struggle for a work/life balance or if someone struggles to find childcare.
good,"Typical work 8 hours."
good,"My typical day at Publix would consist of unloading trucks, stocking shelves, and ordering. Publix is a good company to work for. Learned a lot about ordering and  replenishing the aisle and supply and demand."
good,"I gave six years to this company and I watched people come and go.  The lessons I've learned are;  have fun and enjoy your job,  if there is a problem speak up,  love what you do and do what you love, go after the things you want and don't let fear stop you, and finally keep in mind that if you can't handle certain situations without going off the handle then this may not be the company for you."
good,"I worked here as a young man. This is not a place that is meant to provide you with a living. 80% of positions at Publix can be filled by teenagers. If you want extra weekend cash or are a retiree looking to have something to do, this place is perfect."
good,"Publix is a great company to work for, have had lots of good memories there and still continue to have them. Although after being there for four years it just doesn't seem to be my passion. Overall the benefits are nice and there is always opportunity to move up through the company. Once a week pay is always a plus as well. If you're looking for a company to move up in and you love retail I would highly recommend this one!"
good,You must be able to work well with other to get a job done and at a decent pace. Maintaining a fully stocked shelf is very important. Time efficiency is also key.
good,"when every day a few publix shoppers come in with compaints but i was able to accomadate them and help them to leave the store with a smile. i learned to always be a good listener and learn from management. as for as the work place be equal to all staff and mangement regardless of race or sex. The hardest part of the job was geeting the customer to understand the rules,laws,policy of store.The most enjoyable part was making customers who just had a bad day.Being able to smile and enjoy the customer."
good,I have 3 kids to support plus myself with no help. So trying to manage the pay and ask for more hours or change position wasn't an option at the time.
good,The culture is what separates this company and the manager like to encourage inner promotions and growth. The only improvement that I would suggest for this company to consider is a better job work/life balance schedule and also a clear list of tasks to employees to achieve as a team and assigned roles in order to promote greater ownership.
good,I came to Publix and stayed one year. I left my full time job and came to work for Publix on a promise from my then manager that I would be part time in 6 months. I moved around the store and they gave me more responsibilities. But they refused to give me full-time and they had no explaination why. With two kids in college and one on the way I had to leave.
good,"The benefits quickly became the only reason a lot of fellow employees stayed with the company. The cut back on a lot of employee perks but kept perks for Management. For example employees used to get a yearly inventory bonus but now only Department managers and above get the bonus. They increased the amount of hours required in the first year of employment for part-timers to work in order to earn the health, dental, vision, and 401K benefits. It was 1000 when I started and jumped to 1500 shortly before I left."
good,"A typical day would include working on a cash register, or maybe bagging groceries, but could also include working in the liquor store when needed, and the managers are friendly."
good,"I've been in a few departments. overall the mangers in front are bossy or attitude, but co workers are the nicest. In stock clerk you have your own pace and can be a little more relaxed then a fresh dept. I like to be able to drink water freely with out breaking rules. stock clerk or cashier is my fav."
good,"Work was often slow and repetitive, many issues with clientele but a decent and helpful support system made up of both management and peer employees. Flexible hours."
good,"If you plan on working for Publix as a career then, you can make plenty as a manager. However, if you have other career plans, it can become disheartening working there after awhile."
good,"An average day included managing my time to efficiently keep the shelves full, clean and aesthetically pleasing. This included maintaining an optimal working area and offloading any deliveries (pallets of product) in a timely manner."
good,"It was a good customer service experience, also trained in baker, grocery clerk, and went to other warehouses and reset stores. I really enjoy how management rewarded hard work"
good,"For a typical day at work I would come in early, set up and produce whatever was needed that day, clean up and go home. I learned a lot about how to manage my time effectively and how to integrate into a punch clock system. The workplace culture is very customer based, as in pleasing and being familiar with the customer is the first priority. The employees are united in solidarity in this aspect. As far as management goes there were good and bad ones as with every place. I would say that this company is definitely worth working for if you can find yourself working in a department that you really like. The benefits are pretty good even for part-time employees."
good,If you go into management then your life belong to Publix. Best part of my was accomplishing orders as a team working towards a single goal. Customer satisfaction is a major part of the Publix culture.
good,The environment is friendly but fast paced to meet client needs.  It is the only major grocery store in the neighborhood it is located so the store is always busy. Team members get along well and the managers are professional and caring.
good,"Worked temporarily as a cashier and enjoyed the fast-paced environment. Work was never boring for someone who likes customer service, but can get frustrating if you don't like people very much."
good,"Publix was a long term employment for me. It got me through college. It does offer growth, and you can move up in the company. It does take a long time, and can be very competitive."
good,"Bakery area is a very busy and production based area. You do not stand around doing nothing. You must be quick and follow procedure.  You have more flexibility being part time than full time, but you will not receive health insurance. Every employee receives stock in the company and can take advantage of 401 K retirement plan. Alot of times it is learn as you go because training in the field is limited."
good,es una buena empresa pero tarda mucho en verse buenos resultados.
good,I really loved working at Publix but my manger treated me different. I played softball with her daughters. My hours got cut a lot. I went from almost 30 hours to barely even 15 hours.
good,"A typical work day at Publix for a cashier would mostly be sitting by the register and scanning customer's items. Occasionally the cashier will also bag groceries. I learned a lot about customer service and how important it is to make sure that the customer is satisfied with his or her shopping experience. There wasn't really a hard part of the job except maybe if you couldn't find an item for a customer and as a part time worker, hours can be hard to get. The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to connect with customers."
good,The job always cares about customers more then employees. They are very flexible with schedules and allow time off. Moving up in company is based on favoritism.
good,"Though it would be stressful at times, Publix was an easy place to work with flexible hours that can work with anyone's schedule. I got along well with the other employees and this job helped shape me into becoming great with customers and more confident."
good,"I was hired on as part-time and told I could go full time when I hit six months, has yet to happen. They also do not promote with-in the store, in order to get promoted you have to relocate. They offer life, vision, and dental to part-time workers, you need to be full time to get health. Also, no room for overtime, they will send you home early if you're close. They work well around family events and other schedules."
good,When I first started I had an experienced manager but shortly after they swapped him out. The new guy had something to prove and butted heads with a lot of people along the way. Constant stress to get things done in an unreasonable amount of time and if you didn't get it done you get chewed out in a public way. Hours fluctuated. You were expected to stay late but they didn't always schedule someone to open the doors so there were many days spent waiting outside. They explain the benefits but not how and when you can sign up. No discounts for groceries. They hire people with no experience at higher pay rates and better positions. All about who you know not how you do.
good,Publix is a great place to work especially if you plan to move up in the company although I was not getting paid much I was only part-time and had to quit because I moved out of state. Publix is a great place for opportunity and has great benefits as well. With this being said they could there part-timers more
good,"Its a good company to work for. But it can have it cons as well as pros. Be willing to have constant changing schedule, and not make as much money as you would prefer."
good,A typical work day was very stressful. Being a cashier required counting a lot of money and dealing with a lot of customers. The management at Public is horrible. The company throws their management around and does not keep a solid foundation. The workplace culture is very favorite based. Certain jobs are given based off of whether the individual running the counter favors the individuals working under him or her. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is building relationships with the community come inside the store.
good,It's a paycheck you can depend on. Moving up isn't really a thing anymore unless you're there for several years. Hours keep getting cut and more is added on to the job every year.
good,"Working for publix was great until they cut me back to one day a week.. no one can make a living doing that. Working for publix was great, just was hard working one day a week. I do recommend if you’re going for full time."
good,this is a great first job the pay was a little over minimal wage and they work with you school schedule and even have whats called super minor which allowed me to get a job at 15 which was great.
good,"Dress professional for interview, men have to be clean saved daily, women can't wear their hair down unless it's short or half up, no tennis shoes, no jeans."
good,"A typical day at work involved helping costumers as well, as maintaining the clean and in order for costumers to have a good shopping experience. It taught how to communicate with people and how to keep them satisfied in their shopping experience. The hardest part of the job were the hours. Hours were flexible but I wasn't given enough hours. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was talking to the costumers, meeting new people, an having the opportunity to talk and work with them."
good,Publix is super flexible with schedules so that's a plus. wasn't terrible hard work pay was ok and management depends on who you have but Publix is a good starting job for high schoolers. if you aren't full time you get no benefits and working part time you won't get enough hours for the benefits.
good,"Assisting customers, taking food orders online and via phone, upsetting products, slicing meats and cheeses, preparing food platters, sanitization and restocking food and supplies."
good,Overall good for a beginning job. Also a good learning experience. I think there should be a faster promotion process. And the benefits for part-time should be slightly better.
good,"Over all, Publix is a great company and I highly suggest it for any people in school. They are very flexible and willing to work with you. It mostly taught me people skills which is why I believe is why I am so successful now."
good,I worked for Publix for ten years. I learned many trades and have been molded to give exemplary customer service. The only problem was being able to advance my career. Because I serve in the Army National Guard I was told I would be unable to make full time therefore not being being able to make it to management. I left the company shortly after I was told this.
good,"It’s good company to work for and  they value they’re "
good,"its all about serving customers, all about getting the job done, company has great benefits, starting at publix is great for the young and youthful, overall a great company."
good,"This is a great work environment and provides great opportunity for those who would like a good carer in management. Also, a great first job for people and great benefits if you stick with them."
good,Great place to work if you’re young and just starting out. Pay is low. Managers are easy to get along with and they work well with others. Publix is a corporation so they don’t take the opinions of lower level workers.
good,Good place to work. A lot of change over in management. You would learn one managers way of doing things then a new one would come in and you would have to change it up.
good,"Publix is very good at making sure you are working your entire shift.  The days go by quickly, but, it can be very challenging to get administrative work done."
good,"Publix is a great company, and offers a lot of options for employees to thrive. The company also has great stock options and benefits for their employees."
good,Not happy with working full time hours for a year and not getting full time benefits.No paid vacation.Very fast paced and demand is high.Liquor store has np restroom and have to wait sometimes extended period for someone to relieve you to use bathroom next door..Have given Publix 19 years of service .This is my third time back and both times before I was given full time within 3 months.This time I have given them a year and still cannot get store manager to give me full time.Je disconnects himself from liquor store.Out of sight out of mind
good,"good place to start a career but eventually long hours,barely appreciated,overtime rules suck where they can work you all day and kick you out when they feel like you're headed for overtime ."
good,"It is a very good place to work, any day one work in the plant, you will learn one new thing. The management is okay but need improvement. Good employee benefit."
good,"Typical day is returning items, selling lottery tickets and money orders, also doing money transfers.Gives a boost of confidence working with a company that is highly respected. Management changes every time someone gets a promotion some are better than others some think its a high school because of gossip. The hardest part was dealing with customers who were involved in fraudulent activities, The best part is the regular customers who make your day."
good,"They offer many benefits to part-time employees that others don't.  After 1000 work hours you get Vision and Dental coverage. After 1500 you get medical and prescription coverage. You also get 401k and stock after your first year."
good,Eight hour days of stocking and cashiering. Enjoyed working with a variety of people in a low stress environment. The management is very helpful and willing to flexible with schedules.
good,The Hardest part of the job at Publix was my co workers. Co workers at Publix were not understanding my needs of asking for assistance they ignored me
good,A good place to work if you get fulltime. Advancement is slow and difficult to achieve. Managment is generally stable and the work environment is respectful and fast-paced. Met and worked with some of the most wonderful people in the world.
good,Great company to work for specially if you just came to US. Great training and decent compensation. Many opportunities to move around in different departments and stores if you relocate.
good,"Management is good, but I do not have any health insurance because I don't meet the hourly quota, but that is because they wont give me the hours that I request!"
good,loved working in my department. the people were fantastic to work with. i wish there was more training. it was tough to really understand what was expected. had to depend on my peers to do the job correctly
good,"A very busy, productive and at times stressful workplace.  I've learned managing takes a lot of patience. You're not just a teacher but also a therapist and guidance counselor. The pay is great! As a manager you can't always go home when you want to."
good,"very stressful, was on feet for long periods of time. Hours were very inconsistent, no benefits. They don't hire people in full time. I needed more hours and benefits."
good,"Friendly environment at least from what I had seen and a good ability to move up into full-time and  beyond as long as you show your willing to work and perform your job."
good,"The company it self is great, good pay, great benefits, okay bonuses."
good,Although I am no longer employed with Public Supermarket I felt that during the 13 years that I worked there previously that it was a great collaboration and a great learning experience for me.
good,Good company to work for. It is hard to be in management and to have a personal/family life. If you don't have a family very good management opportunities.
good,"stocking shelves with product for our customers ,i learn how to be a pro in customer services , our work place was very  fun at at time being the early morning shift."
good,low wages lots of work but cool people to work with. at times you may know more about the place them some managers depending on the jobs you've held working for this company. lots of putting down. people still fighting for fair treatment there. they have stock options so that's a plus.
good,"Publix was a fun and friendly place to work at . I learned to work registers . Greet customers and always make sure if everything was okay , and what could I do to make it better . Stocking and making sure everything was in the correct place and aisle with the label always being in the front. Making sure to go thru the morning checklist when opening , And as well with closing . Making sure the store is cleaned swept and mopped before closing , making sure all the trash was out and putting more napkins, soap and tissue in the restrooms if needed after every shift, helping customers carry their groceries to their car and making sure the parking lot was always clean ."
good,The work good for teenagers and collage kid's but older people they want there all the time. It's like they want you there every day with little time for family and friends
good,"A typical day at work is hard. It is fast paced and sometimes can be unorganized. Some days hold more tasks then others depending on the truck schedules and how many employees are there that day."
good,There is not a lot of room for advancement as they like to keep more part time employees to work rather than pay full timers as they would have to pay for benefits and paid time off.
good,Unreliable co-workers stressing the overall work base.  The company needs to pay people more to be in todays competitive retail market. Company needs to update technology....it's still in the stone age!
good,"Publix had a friendly atmosphere to work in. But the production support hours were long and taxing at times."
good,Working at publix has been fun. Employees are friendly and the place was very clean. The products are so organized. The managers were super kind that you could consider them as your friend.
good,It's an okay place to work. There's little room for advancement. It's hard to go from PT to FT. Hard to get a good amount of hours in certain departments.
good,Working here can be a great job only if you're full time. Part time workers really don't get alot of benefits due to the hours they get. No overtime is given. You may get lucky but you might not most of the time.
good,"Publix is the sort of employer that will work you hard, but will absolutely take care of you and provide benefits. A lot of the management is sub-par, as many of them have little to no formal education and have acquired the role through sheer attrition, but this is testament that there are plenty of advancement possibilities. Co-workers tend to range from pleasant to annoying, as you get a full mix of people. The hardest part of the job is trying to complete the goals you have been given, while trying to figure out the exact way your manager wants it done without being given specific instructions, while being told that your ideas on how to do the job effectively and efficiently matter. The most enjoyable part for me is any time I am able to inform a customer about a product they are seeking information on, or helping them find something they are looking for."
good,Publix was a fun and relaxed way to spend the day. i had no problems getting up and going to work in the morning. they knew when to be serious and when to have fun
good,Not a good focus on their company motto of always helping the customer. Instead they wold reprimand you because you spent time helping a customer when theres work to do in the back. Unrealistic with their supplies always have too many and too little time. Expect their employees to do all the work while the managers sit around and laugh and talk rather than working as well.
good,"I worked at Public from ages 17-24. I worked part time in the deli; it could be very slow or busy, depending on the day and who else was working. I wouldn't consider it a career but it was good when I was in school."
good,"A regular day at work, also a place I learned to speak to people better. Also learned how to stock shelves and a little bit of how business works. they also had good benefits that helps towards retirement."
good,Takes time be patient there a good company you just need to stay on track do the Best you can and everyone will love having you there.customers are always right.
good,"Enjoy working at publix. High energy, high demand excellent stock, and benefits. Great learning experience high demand enjoy the interaction with customers."
good,Days are generally slow and general experience depends completely on the management staff. Upward mobility can be difficult to achieve but overall a fairly pleasant workplace atmosphere.
good,Good job to work while in high school or once you have finished high school. It will help you gain work experience required for other jobs. Also you can move up in this company.
good,"Great company to work for, could be better and more flexable on shifts.  Learned a great deal on how to deal with other co works. Great training. company should treat everyone on a equal level , not to pick favors. Should have a better training program for new employees. Management could help out more."
good,"As a part timer I was treated fairly and given hours to sustain my income but there was a noticeable difference in treatment, hours, and wage, between me and my co workers, and I found that this is more than just because of my part timer status, it was because I had no intention of staying with Publix long term."
good,"If you are looking for a place to humble yourself and become more patient, this is where you want to start. Overall it's not a bad place to work depending on the department and mostly on your management."
good,"Publix has always been the hometown store that employs the high school students. The majority of the associates are under the age of 21, so it makes for a very strange environment, especially when there are student events such as Homecoming and Prom and all of a sudden every worker is off. The hardest part of working at Publix was watching the store go from a community store to a corporate nightmare. The best part of working at Publix was how accommodating they are for different things such as disabilities, students, and people with multiple jobs."
good,"Publix offers good pay compared to other entry level retail positions. Generally speaking managers are competent and enjoyable to work with and learn from. Positive recognition is a regular occurrence. Plenty of good career opportunities, wether you want to stay at the store level, work in distribution, or even for corporate. Work environment is generally enjoyable. Coworkers are generally friendly people because Publix wants people that will provide great customer service. Has a great culture with a strong foundation that makes it possible for continued success. Excellent stock ownership plan."
good,Publix is a great company to work for and age their employees as needed like family a very supportive workplace with coworkers and management as well.
good,Great company with great benefits. However the hours are long and it is a constant battle with employees due to the fact that publix hires minors.Great stock benefits
good,"Atypical day was different every day, i handled prepared foods to working as a deep frier. i really enjoyed the co-workers and management was friendly also"
good,Great pay...they ask alot from you. They will spend time and invest in you. fun people. night shift and over nights and crazy overall schedule. Great training and famliy environment.
good,"A day of creating and processing purchase orders. Followed by the issuing of materials needed for the daily job sites around the warehouse. Also, daily inventory cycle counts of the various 13,000 material items."
good,It's ok jobs depends on what warehouse your at the management could be much better u will work weekends and get weekdays off but they have good benefits that's a plus
good,"Moving up in the company can be difficult."
good,Wonderful people to work with in an exclusive members only experience. It's refreshing to find members who actually enjoy coming to the store and remember your name.
good,"I started at Publix as my first job and I enjoyed my time there for the most part. Unfortunately, management is starting to slip in my opinion, and there is a lot of favoritism, especially in regards to advancement. Evaluations are sometimes biased as well depending on the manager. Also, your schedule varies by week and you rarely have two days off in a row. Great benefits though"
good,"I enjoy helping customers and getting to know them. It can be a little stressful when dealing with unhappy customers, but I enjoy solving their problems and having them walk out happy.  Turning them around is the most difficult part of the job, but also can be the most rewarding."
good,"not consistent/ wonderful customer service..wonderful company overall. I would recommend this Company to everybody. The benefits are awesome as well, I felt fully as if they genuinely cared about my health enough to offer me full compensation in benefits...health, dental and vision"
good,"preparing meals was ok,since i"
good,"publix was my first job for 5 good years, I enjoyed it, management started getting difficult, made it kind of hard to be comfortable working, but great place to work overall"
good,"Typical day at work involved engaging customers frequently, stocking shelves, and handling customer complaints. An awesome place to work if you like being surrounded by great people on a daily basis."
good,Very focused on customer service.  Cross training is the key to know as much as possible.  Opportunities to grow with management. Having a positive attitude.
good,"the job working at Publix, specifically the deli, is overall a good experience. Boars head supplies great training to help Publix associates talk to customers about products and helps create great communication skills"
good,good atmosphere management wasnt bad pay sucked very young associates managers usualy been there for years managers get paid better better benefits only fofulltime
good,I do love my job here but sometimes it can be little unbearable and i don't see myself advancing in the company and i know it's not what i want to do at the end of the day. The managers can be unfair and play favorites. I love the customers and honestly that's what makes me come back everyday.
good,"unload trucks , clean and stock shelves, customer service, meet a lot of people, families .the hardest part of the job is unloading of the trucks , everything is unloaded with a pallet jack"
good,A typical day at Publix consists of assisting customers through the Publix culture to accomplish their desires and needs. I Love the wonderful people I have grown with throughout the years and do recommend Publix to all! The hardest part of dealing with the public is the fact that the customer is always right! But overall Publix is not a bad company to work for!
good,The hours varys the management thinks about ur safety clean environment everyone looks out for one another the hardest part of the job is just knowing how to schedule ingredients as needed
good,"if you're in school this is a good job for you. They'll easily work around your school schedule. If you're looking for a job where you can move up and make something of yourself, this isn't for you."
good,The job was a very fast paced job especially on holidays but with the staff we had it was manageable.  Customers were friendly but hardest part of the day were slowest due to the rain .
good,"Its a great company thus far I like it been going on 8 years "
good,"assist customers, many administrative tasks. good culture. best part of the job is the pay, once into management. company has good intentions, but can not follow through with me."
good,"In the last few years, productivity requirements have been raised sharply."
good,"Amazing work place lots of oppertunitys to learn and gain experience, such as stocking shelves cutting meat. Great place to learn work ethic. This Job would be a amazing place for anyones first Job to work your way up in rank or pay."
good,"I work at the front service desk taking customer issues, and filling out Western Unions. I provide customer service, and give information on products."
good,"I worked for Publix a long time and did many different jobs, I enjoyed my job and unfortunatly had to leave for personal reasons at that time."
good,very good company very difficult to move up within the company not much advancement for education management does not keep employees inform of update information as what is going on within the company
good,Publix has nice compensation benefits for employees and works hard to maintain a safe work environment for all. They have high standards and help their employees to reach them.
good,The company is good and my coworker are good people . I have learned a lot from this company. The customer service is amazing. The manager always show fully respect to the customer.
good,Publix is a nice place to work. They have a flexible schedule and will work around your schedule once you let management know the hours you'd like to work.Great benefits also.
good,Its a job. you get paid weekly and you have benefits and stalk. Management tends to have favorites which bugged me.coworkers were alright. I learned how to manage the store. The hardest part of working here is the deli.
good,Management at Publix is unprofessional and inexperienced. Hourly pay is abysmal and negotiating a wage is almost impossible. You are asked to do work outside of your job title and pay.
good,"Overall good company. This job requires long hours workout lunch breaks. On a positive note,  you are off on holidays and every other weekend. Would recommend this job to others."
good,"Department manager was excellent, and I believe employees should be given more opportunities for more hours and advancement. Example if you are only employed part time and want full time there should be an assessment to do so, as well as approval from the department managers. The store manager should also have an open door policy."
good,a typical day was eventful. it was fun and you could always expect the customers or co-workers to make you laugh. the management we nice too. the most enjoyable part of my day was seeing the customers smile as they walked out the door
good,"the management could use improvement, and they care more about the customers than they will ever care about their workers."
good,"My daily life at Publix was a great one, due to the fact that the minute I walk in, I can go straight to my work station and start my job without the need of asking my superiors what needs to be done."
good,"A typical day at work is a busy one. In the Customer Service Department there are always customers asking where items are or whether or not they can use coupons on a certain product. What I have learned is that Publix is the type of company where ""the customer is always right"" no matter how ridiculous the request may be. The management varies since every few years departments have changes in leadership. Overall they try their hardest to get to know people but more often than not are unsuccessful. Co-workers vary since Publix has a wide range of employees, both young and old. The hardest part of the job is watching manager ""favorites"" getting to slack off. The most enjoyable part of Publix would be the few customers that are pleasurable to deal with, and who go out of their way to get to know their cashiers and Publix employees."
good,"Publix is a place that kids who are still in high school have a chance to get first hand experience with working with a company. Simple tasks, and simple pay."
good,"This job is good for someone who isn't looking for a full time job, or needing to support themselves or others. The co-workers are friendly, and the environment is usually laid back and relaxed. Management is understanding, and can be helpful when needed. The hardest part about the job is angry customers and inability to recieve the hours needed. However, the most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with the customers, both new and regular."
good,"keeping busy the whole shift made the hours seem to go by fast"
good,Had a great time working for publix and the staff at my store and would always like to have that kind of team I had with publix
good,Great place to work but the hours and the pay are very low. To move up in the company is not easy. But they will move you up. I am looking for more then what they can offer me.
good,"Customer Service is essential at all costs. "
good,This job was good because I was able to interact with many different people on a daily basis. The management was good and my co-workers made my job a fun place to be.
good,"Just like any other job it has it ups and downs, I enjoyed working with the other employees but you could always tell the managers had their favorites."
good,Typical work days include management badgering their managers.  Good place to work if you enjoy working hard and having little recognition.  Finding a good manager to work for and is willing to teach you is the hardest part.  Enjoyable part of the job is satisfying people and becoming a team with co-workers.  You learn people skills and how to work two different ways: by the book with safety and precaution vs. get the job done while ignoring safety and quality.
good,"i was started as a dely associate and i got promoted to an deli clerk"
good,Enjoyed working for Publix. It was a great experience and a good company. They had a dedication to making a customer feel welcome and appreciated. I felt part of a family and not just associates.
good,Nice place to work.  I enjoyed working customer service and handling all the duties included with the cash office.  I get along well with others and being part of a team.
good,Not a bad company to work for. The best time to start would be when you are young and in highschool. The moving up process could take a few years to get or even aquire fulltime.
good,I enjoy working for Publix. It's decent pay for the job required and many benefits. A typical day for me is organizing the products on the shelves and stocking what needs to be filled.
good,"Would be an excellent place for a career for anyone if advancement opportunities were not almost strictly based on race. I was obviously the best candidate for a full time position which meant I would receive a full benefits package which is only available to full time employees. Being full hispanic was denied the position to an employee far less qualified who I had seniority over. The reason so I was told was because he was not full hispanic but rather a quarter hispanic, because the position needed to be filled by a minority."
good,"At the customer service desk one has to deal with multiple tasks like handling returns/exchanges, cashiering, taking costumers complaints/concerns, inventory, merchandise receiving, inbound calls, cash counting and opening or closing and balancing the cash registers. Management was always very supportive in aiding us to successfully complete our tasks and duties."
good,"Good People and Customers,"
good,A typical day at Publix consists of bagging groceries for customers who are completing their transactions helping load them in to their cars as well as maintaining the shelves to make sure everything is properly stocked and being shown. Very friendly co-workers and overall fun experience.
good,"I enjoye working at publix but they didn't pay enough and my shift was prn sometime there was no work the whole week. the store manager was nice enough to look in to letting me float to a stocking position for more hours but I cordially declined, wanting to work in the pharmacy"
good,typical day is super busy. the customer wasn't always a pain they gave out gifts on holidays But munderstanding with certain situationsanagement wasn't always
good,"I can rely on my co-workers help, and management is adaptable to my needs as far as work hours available. Time off is given freely."
good,Fun place to work. I would reccommend this place as a starting point for anyone looking for employment. This company will also work with your school schedule.
good,"Every department has it's few managers that are unpleasant.  My biggest complaint is the entitlement those feel that have been employed with Publix for so long. They don't realize how lucky they are to have a job with a  good, secure company."
good,"Typical day starts with stretching and kick off meeting, then you select. I learned how to be extremely efficient in my work thanks to having to keep a percentages. Co-workers are pretty much friendly and helpful."
good,"Great place to work! When You decide to make grocery retail your career, it becomes harder to succeed, there is always someone one step ahead, be willing to travel."
good,"I loved working for UPS, it takes time but you can advance within this company and obtain a career the management was great & it was a very productive team environment."
good,Ok place to work you meet a lot of people. Management  could be a lot better. The co-workers are great to work with. The hardest part of the job could sometimes be the customers and the drastic change in the schedule.
good,"*unload truck and load onto pallet for replenishing shelves"
good,"I enjoyed working ar Publix, it was just to hard standing on my feet all day."
good,I liked working here with all of the people. Good experience. Learned new way of life. The hardest part of the job was scrubbing the floors after the store closed. I'm almost 60 years old and this was hard on my body.
good,"Working as a store clerk that was mostly a jack-of-all-trades. I helped train, worked all around the store, Management in some stores were great and others were terrible. Florida stores are more organized and you enjoy going to work while in Georgia, the stores are a hit and miss. Co-workers are full of information and knowledge of the products. Hardest part of my job would be not being stressed out because of what my managers want me to do. While the enjoyable part is making the customers happy and having a leadership role."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people. Working  around good people and learning new things
good,"Although its a solid company that has grown every year of its existence, I was dissappointed with their lack of flexibility in nearly any situation.  "
good,The grocery store was a wonderful place to work because the employees were all amazing and worked really hard. I don't think that management from each department didn't want to take out any additional time training their best employees so that they could promote from within. I believe that with additional efforts by management employees would be better off for it.
good,worked until the orders was out selecting produce i learned how to work safe and select there. my co workers was great and my managers always help. the hardest part of the job was getting my stacking right. The most enjyable part was the free lunch .
good,Publix is really goal oriented they give you a set path to achieve and maximize your career
good,Publix is a great place to work it is just not for me. I want something more with the education I have received. And I can't see myself making Publix into a long term career.
good,"The best part of my job was working with the customers, and providing assistance."
good,A typical day includes select 2000 cases in a quick and timely manner. I learned how to work with others in a team environment. Management was very helpful as was the co workers. The hardest part at Publix was the demand it put on a person physically with little to no rest. The most enjoyable part was the free lunch which was prepared hot everyday.
good,I found that the advancement opportunities were tied to your ability to relocate and as a student that dibilitates my interest to continue long term. They had several areas within the company that are available but was not the highest quality of workers that you may work with causing you to contribute to complete tasks for others.
good,"A typically day would be clocking in at 2, and having only till 3 to get the entire stores sale items back in full stock. At 3 we would block the store, also known as bringing items forward and turning the labels. Would finish this by 5, and would go on break till 6. After returning the store would be such a mess in the 3 hours of peak daytime shopping and you had to get everything refilled, displays turned over (depending on the day), and also had all of your closing duties. Average day was scheduled 2-11, I would almost always stay past 11, most of the time it was because of another department not finishing in time."
good,Loved working at publix. Very flexible and love the interactions with the customers.
good,"I greet the customers and co-worker and smile , my management was very nice co-workers were great people to work with , the hardest part was leaving and my enjoyable moments are seeing my regular customers daily"
good,"A typical day at work while working at Publix was always presenting excellent, friendly ,customer service towards all customers. Always put the customers needs and wants first. Handled cash daily and use of other customer service operations such as the cash register.  While employed at this job I learned how and what to do in certain daily situations with people and public. I learned proper customer service skills for future employment, became more goal oriented to advance in employment, and also better communication skills. I did work the customer service desk as well as a cashier . Certain days I did work around the  managers daily. I Never had any problems, conflicts  or negative situations with any of the managers. I never had the desire to advance in a management position in that type of employment though. For me I really couldn't point out anything hard about the job. It could be stressful on certain days in your personal life though, but I enjoyed working just in an open environment with the public and working with cash was a plus for me due to previous cash handling experience and skills."
good,Assisting customers and maintaining products for easy shopping.
good,A typical day for me would be once that I clocked in I would say hello to everyone including customers and begin my job duties. I have learned the importance of working together to complete a task and teaching others new skills also. Management at this workplace was fine and it was understood that if I had any issues with anyone then I would address that issue with the next one in-charge. The hardest part about this job was that there were many different personalities on a monthly basis. The most enjoyable part of this job is that I actually loved working with my co-workers because I felt as if they were my second family.
good,"Publix is a fun place to work, specially if you are a people person."
good,i learned how important it is to help people out to there car and the smile they give after a long day of shpping. management was ok and co-workers was wonderful the hardest thing was going to work at night and high school the next morning.
good,"They give a lot of training on customer service, personal appearance, and company vision. It was hard for them to give me steady hours in order for me to attend my college classes."
good,"They change managers often and usually they come in treating the staff badly, but not always."
good,I enjoyed my time working at my local Publix.  It was a great job to supplement my income while going to high school.  I would recommend this company for anyone who is people-oriented.
good,Publix taught me how to communicate to my co-workers and to provide great customer service. I was the main cook for the deli. I got along with my management great. I learned how to cater to a customers needs. I was able to provide the customer with the knowledge of the products. I also learned to do inventory counts and orders for the department. I have been with Publix for four years. I learned my job so well I never had a hard day. I enjoyed making my customers happy and satisfied. They continued to come back.
good,"asisting customers,explain product,meet new people dayli"
good,"Customer service oriented work place, where we pride our selves on providing premiere customer service. We focus on making the customer happy and making sure that they are satisfied before leaving the store. A typical day would be working the customer service counter, supervising, cashiering, and helping employees and customers. The hardest part of the job would be; striving to meet all the guests needs because all customers are different. The most enjoyable part of the job would be; being able to satisfy customers, and receiving a thank you and a smile. I've learned that hard work can go a long way."
good,I enjoyed it very much. I met someone new everyday and everyone was friendly.
good,"A typical day a work consists of helping a lot of customers in the bakery and making sure that nothing but the best quality products are put on the floor for the customers to purchase. I've learned at this job that you may not always agree with the customer but it is super important that you do everything in your power to make sure that the customer is always as happy as possible when they are leaving the store. It is also important to try your hardest to go above and beyond standard expectations even when no one is watching you. Management for the most part is really good however, there are some of the managers who need some more training in employee interaction. I love the people I work with they are all super nice and normally try to help you out when you need it, In a lot of ways we are kind of like a family. The hardest part of the job is probably taking care of the customers they aren't always reasonable when it comes to things that we can and cannot do. The most enjoyable part of the job is also the customers, it is always a super rewarding feeling when you are able to go above and beyond just to make the customer super happy."
good,"Everyday at Publix, I did the same tasks for the most part. I helped customers with serving them lunch meat and cheese, subs, fried chicken, orders, etc. I cleaned everyday, which involved wiping the slicers down, sweeping, wiping the counter tops, etc. I also refilled the sub station, handled the hotcase, fried chicken, made sides(like macaroni & cheese), made peanut butter and banana pudding, answered phone calls, etc. I learned a lot about customer service; how to slice meat and cheese; fry chicken; prepare subs; differences between lunch meats and cheese; answering phone calls; preparing platters; how to clean a slicer, fryer, hot case, sub station, etc. Management seemed to care at about their employees. Sometimes management would take the time and help other departments. My co-workers were friendly and they were always there when I needed them. We always did teamwork very well. The hardest part of the job was when I had to close and it got too busy, so we got left behind with our cleaning, so we had to stay overtime. The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team and always getting the job done. I also enjoyed some of the customers that came in regularly. Some of the customers were very friendly."
good,"A typical day at work is either extremely satisfying or sometimes downright terrible. In the end, however you want you day to end up depends on you as the employee. The day can be extremely rewarding when you put in your time and help with customers, stocking, or whatever your job is for the day. Management is well trained and helpful in any manner of ways."
good,I have learned to bag cashier and have great customer service. no part of my job is hard as long as i strive for my goal. the most enjoyable parts of my day is speaking to customers and putting a smile on there face.
good,Publix has been an excellent company to be apart of. Excellent benefits. This job has excellent training options available within the company.
good,Enjoyed working with employees in the pharmacy and helping the customers. The most difficult part of my job was not being able to be involved with all the extracurricular activities such as volunteer walks for research & clinics because of work schedule conflict.
good,"Working as a deli clerk has its ups and downs. The hours are rotating, so scheduling life is difficult. However, if you like to work with people then you will like this position"
good,Its just like any other job that requires a lot of your attention depending on who you work for and which Publix you work for. If you have good co-workers that like to do their job and have fun you'll actually want to go to work. But every store has some bad apples.
good,"Excellent benefits, but the scheduling is difficult when you have a family. Holidays and weekends are your busy times."
good,"Publix has really saved me financially. In this economy jobs are very hard to come by, and Publix has really been a life saver. The managerial staff is wonderful, and co-workers are great as well. My biggest complaint is that they make it seem so easy to advance within the company, to transfer departments or positions and it is not at all."
good,Publix should have more employee discounts. The company motto is where shopping is a pleasure but most of the employees don’t get much hours or respect.
good,Good working environment and the associates are cool people but the management team is all messed up. I don't know if they don't care or if they do not know what they're doing.
good,"If it is a first job or you are looking for a career then it is a great place to work, the benefits are really good, the pay is better then most jobs(depending on your area) and the workers are usually easy to get along with. You get some bad customers, but it also depends on the area you are working in. They are inclusive which is always a great addition. You also get to meet all sorts of interesting people and form bonds with your regulars."
good,"lots of opportunites, and never a dull day. Managment is usually better than average due to employee training and opportunities provided to better education."
good,"Great place to work with friendly associates. You can adjust your schedule whenever you'd like to fit your lifestyle. Depending on the mangers you have, it can make working here more or less enjoyable."
good,"Publix is a clean friendly shopping I have worked here for over 11 years as a cashier and bagger, the hours are flexible in the pay is good. Opportunities to advance.."
good,"It's not that hard to learn everything, it's just the constant energy you put in. With this job you'll learn the best definition of customer service, the management is not that bad but is not that good ether it depends who is your manager."
good,"A typical day at work is coming in and start bagging right away , if not bagging then stocking the candy in shelves or straightening items on isles, then every hour or two there is cart duty for most baggers, depending the day but is really bard working when you have to bring in 10 carts at once, not the hardest job but can be tough on busy days."
good,A typical day at work includes a heavy workload that requires a thoughtful approach to managing your duties to maximize your impact.  I learned to look at managing freight flow in a different manner by organizing 14 stocking carts and approximately 20 pallets of freight per week in which all was perishable. The most enjoyable part of the job is a clean and organized backroom cooler once you have worked all items for the day.  The most difficult part of the job is dealing with broken eggs.  There is good comradery amongst team members and management.
good,"Public was an okay company, they were not focused on helping we get my raises and move up in the company. MOST of the managers are very helpful while others are NOT."
good,Steady work environment. Great people work for.  Company is non-discriminatory.  They help young kids with school advancement.    Have fun with holidays.
good,"It used to be a great place to work at, but managers kept changing my positions and changing job departments and took advantage that i wouldn't say no and never changed me in the actual system and never got payed what im supposed to."
good,"I've been blessed to work at Publix for three, going on four years. From customer service, to stock clerk, to deli clerk. Helping out in produce and bakery to now working my way up in meat department, I have been all around Publix and gained so much experience its hard to try to condense it all into a brief summary. I will just say there's a wealth of knowledge to be gained if one is willing  to apply themselves. I am part time and it seems rather hard to receive full time but with that being said the managers are willing to work with you concerning your schedule. They definitely look out for the hard working employees. Depending on the department and people you happen to work with, some departments  have more teamwork and unity than others. The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to service my customers in any way they like while utilizing my store knowledge to the fullest. Hardest part of the job. is getting used to fluctuation in hours per week. I have meet a lot of interesting people while working at Publix."
good,"During my time at Publix, I loved working there. Helped to teach me a lot about customer satisfaction as well as professional responsibility. Management could use improvement. Not much opportunity for career advancement. I enjoyed that it was steady hours as well as steady raises that followed with good health benefits."
good,"My typical day was bagging and helping to stock the isles.  But mostly bagger.  Learned how to work with customers and how to make them happy and how important it is to reflect a positive attitude.  Management was good, offered a lot of learning curves.. Nothing, really hard about this job, but the most rewarding was dealing to and speaking with customers and getting to know so many different walks of life."
good,"it was quick-paced usually, I learned to cashier and bag groceries, the management was ok, but I was promised a raise and a position advancement and never received it. The hardest part of the job was the physical labor. I enjoyed getting to know the customers and their preferences."
good,Okay place to work you work constant weekends. Spending a lot of time away from family and social events and the work hours are upside down. They need better hours of operation
good,Typically I get troubleshooting tickets and I have to contact with the user and get the necessary information about what the issue is. Speaking with some users is fun and helps in getting new friends at Publix. But I came across some users who have less technical knowledge and it gets very difficult for me to understand what the problem is and troubleshoot the issue.
good,"Publix is a fantastic company to work for if you do not mind retail. The hours can be odd and you work most holidays, but the Employee Stock Ownership Program and their 401k is a great bonus. The tough part is getting into management."
good,"I was oftentimes working with others who were lazy or not willing to do certain chores towards the end of the night when the store would close; however, getting paid every week is a huge pro."
good,"Of the seven years and 4 months at Publix I had been in the frozen section for at least 7 years. Uncomfortable most of the time, but I took it in stride. What I liked about it was the nearly semi-independent status associated with the position. I knew what to do to keep backstock at a minimum; I kept the station clean; going so far as to keep ice from making progress along the shelves; something I never saw anyone else doing. Eventually I was transferred to basically closing every night and all I can think of was the tedium associated with aligning all the labels to face in the same direction as well as assuring the canned goods were on the same level. I was bored to distraction!."
good,"If it's temporary or you intend to move up with the company publix is a good option, becoming full time or a manager makes publix a way better option of employment."
good,"Great place to work. However, employees are not promoted based on how well or hard they work. There is definitely favoritism and if you don't know someone, good luck. It's a busy place, and time can fly by. Hurricane season offers a lot of over time."
good,"There is always good and bad days, overall working at Publix is a very family and friendly oriented place. It can and will get hectic at certain points of the day but it’s nothing that you and the team members can’t handle. May run into some problems along the way but managers are usually nearby to help."
good,Publix was a great place overall. The upper management seems disinterested in what lower level associates have to say but in general the management in the store is easy to work with.
good,Publix is a great place to work with amazing benefits. A typical day at Publix is calm yet productive. There is always something to do. From what I learned at Publix is premiere customer service is key. The customer is your boss. Everything is done for the customer which can be the hardest part of the job if they're not satisfied.
good,Most of the day is either bagging items for people or going outside to get shopping carts. There is always something to keep you busy. There are many great benefits.
good,"I don't enjoy working in retail environments. They are stressful, busy and noisy, and you need to be personally motivated to succeed there which I was not. But Publix offered good pay, flexible hours, and a comfortable work area so all things considered it was a good experience."
good,"Publix may be the best company in the world to work for if you are lucky to have a good manager, but this will not last for a long time because they are transferred to another store every 3 years or so. Your average working hours will depend on the manager's criteria and it may be that on average you work only 10 hours per week and if you have to pay bills you will be lost because the manager may not care, they do have enough hours of work per week.  Nor can you have a fixed work schedule a week that allows you to look for another stable job because the schedules change every Tuesday at night and it can happen that one week you work Sunday, Monday and Wednesday in the morning and the next week your work schedules  be Sunday, Thursday and Friday afternoons.  Although they will always give you the option to leave in writing your availability to work if you cannot work on weekends and cannot work after 8 pm no matter your reasons, you can be questioned by your manager and as blackmail will tell you that  For that reason you cannot get more than 10 hours of work per week.  I repeat, it does not matter that the reason is for health, or because you have a family situation where you should take care of another person.  If you expect to get a full-time job in the company, forget it, it will be a minimum of 10 years before that happens, no matter if you are the best worker in the world, this will not happen easily.  If you work as a baguer and it is a typical Florida rainy day, with lightning bolts included, your manager may be more interested in having cars available for purchase rather"
good,"Poor management, they always sided with the customer on every issue which became frustrating. Also upper management would often not do enough of their work and that made it harder on us."
good,"Good starting job for teens 14-16.  It was average. Management was slow to advance promotion. The pay would not increase with job promotion. The work culture was ok, didn’t get enough hours though."
good,"There are probably better publix locations to work for and overall the job itself was easy, however, I experienced a lot of work place harassment (sexually and physically) as a minor and nothing was done about it. The pay is not great but the hours are consistent for the most part."
good,"At publix a typical workday there is working product to the shelf and maintaining excellent shelf conditions. Since working there I've learned how to work as a team. How to always find solutions to unprecedented problems. The management there is always changing, so sometimes you might get a qualified or an unqualified manager.The culture at Publix depends on the acting management at the time. If they are on them all the time about presentation, then the culture their changes. The hardest party about Publix is that alot of things happen unexpectedly. The enjoyable part of the job is the presence of a good days work, and servicing customers up close and personal."
good,"Loved working for Publix. Managers were great and work with you as best they can. Coworkers were great. Learned a lot about customer service, cash handling and sales production. Work days could get long and busy but managers made sure to make you as comfortable as needed. Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with other people. Hardest part of the job was being on your feet consistently for 10+ hours sometimes."
good,"I enjoy working for Publix, I don't like the long hours and no over time. If I work long hours all week don't cut me on Friday so I don't get over 40 hours."
good,Great benefits and coworkers. Hours scheduled were unfair and never rotated while management would leave early and come in late. Management also rotated weekends but wouldn’t allow associates to do them same.
good,"It’s actually a fun job once you get to know the customers that come in often, the manager really looks into detail on how your interacting with other co-workers and customers."
good,It’s a great place to work. The only down side is it’s very hard to make time for other things with the schedules you have to work. If you work hard you can move up in the company.
good,Publix offers amazing benefits. Not to good when it comes to family and life. Expectations are very high. Great company over all. Must be able to move with the pace. It changes almost daily.
good,Its a good company just need to work on hours more. Management is a good balance of serious. And making work fun. You learn how to come out of your shell.
good,"They always had you doing productive stuff like bagging properly and handling the cash register proper procedures. You had to learn how to bag proper way and take care of customers a certain way , dress a certain way, shave and look presentable for your customers be clean and tidy and polite and smile say hello."
good,A typical day would be getting yelled at for something while you calmly fix the problem then  you quickly become on the customers good side. the hardest part of the job is controlling your own emotions.
good,I wanted to do something different when we moved here so I started at publix in the deli it is a very busy department.  Your day goes by really fast and it was a great learning to I was thankful to be able to experience working in such a great department! I would go back to work there if I needed to.
good,Publix came to my rescue as a temporary job.  Work in the deli is challenging.  Management is very knowledgeable.  They continue to train me in all facets of the deli.
good,Job was enjoyable. Staff was easy-going. Arguably not enough benefits and salary was low. It was good for a first job and would gladly do it over again.
good,"have worked at Publix for 6 years, I have tried to get a full-time position after a year working there, they have not had a full-time position. hours vary from 20 to 30 hours."
good,Working at Publix and trying to advance is all about who you know not necessarily how well you do your job. A lot of the time you are treated unfairly for being sick and are made to feel guilty about being sick and calling out. However if you work for Publix and your pub your nose to the grindstone everyday they will take care of you and you will be able to retire a millionaire
good,"I moved to Florida in 2017 and decided Publix would be a great place to work while I finished school. The benefits are great and there was also an option to buy private stock. However, to get these benefits you need to work 1500 hours in a year. Being new to Florida I was unaware how drastically hours are cut during the summer months and never came close to reaching the minimum required hours. The job did pay well compared to similar jobs and I really liked everyone I worked with."
good,"I used to bleed green.  I would do anything for the company ad I thought the company would do anything for me.  Turns out when it was my turn to need help they were still only concern with @ehat can I do for them?” After all the years and extra time I put in because I loved the company I worked for I suddenly realized the brutal truth they didn’t loved me. All that aside I think that’s the way the world works, after all if your not producing for the company regardless the reason then your just holding them back. I get it. I really do.  Just the reality of it was a feeling of “betrayed” at the time. Overall, I think this company could be one of the greats if they took a bottom-up approach instead of a top-down approach.  Employees on the frontlines battling daily can provide the ones up top with vital information to improve healthcare and optimized patient care programs instead of choosing to be clueless with the day to day problems that arise from the programs that are being implemented and offered to our patients."
good,"lately, upper management has taken it upon themselves to micromanage the department managers. Department managers essentially have no authority. They can't even write up an associate without store manager approval."
good,"The job for cashiers and customer service were very productive and busy. Certain days were smoove sailing and others could be a bit of a rush but, overall it was a very nice job to have."
good,I enjoyed working for Publix Both  my department manager and store manger were both amazing and very flexible but some of the employees were less than pleasant to work with.
good,"Publix was my first real job and I'm grateful for all of the invaluable life lessons that working there taught me. I experienced a good share of personalities and workers while working there for ten years.There were some associates that I did and didn't get along with, but overall the experience was a good one. The benefits and stock options offered by the company are some of the best in retail industry."
good,"It’s definitely a good job, but it’s very demanding at times and when you’re salary it can be stressful. Especially with the hours you put in per day and they add up quickly. On the flip side it has great benefits and private stock."
good,"I have been with the company for quite some time. I definitely enjoyed my time thus far, but I am ready for something else where my weekends can bee free. I pretty much work every weekend and the hours although is 40 per week, can be quite inconsistent. They give raises twice a year and they absolutely suck! it will take forever to see real money"
good,"Hard work, and a positive attitude will go a long way.  Always a friendly fun work environment with a lot of positive reinforcement.  If you don't reach a certain amount of hours benefits will not be available to you."
good,"Publix is a great environment to work in. Customers are typically polite, and you form friendships with the locals. I will warn you, if you are interested in working in the deli, brace yourself for a very stressful workplace. Constant working, to the point of dizziness. But if you can manage your stress you should be okay."
good,"My typical work day involved stocking product, looking for and organizing product. Helping customers in anyway possible. Teaching and learning from co-workers to increase productive and  efficiency. The culture varies depending on the location but being friendly and clean is important"
good,"I work in the deli, and let me tell you don't work in the deli. Its the worst position in the store. Sure it pays more and the Store manager tries to sale it to everyone cause nobody wants to work in the Deli. Long shifts no breaks. Always out of supplies, etc.. When you close its a huge hassle to help customers and clean the place up which is a nightmare. Trust me don't do it. nobody likes it, only reason I stay is because they work with my schedule, I take care of my twins during the day and work at night."
good,I worked as a produce clerk and got promoted to assistant produce manager.  Job wasnt too bad but was very physical. You get paid sick time by how many hours you work. Stock options are good. I retired to go to school
good,"Work was fast paced, but was fun can be demanding at times. Learned a lot about inventory control and developing repeat customers.Overall the experience is different in every store."
good,It’s a good place to work ! It’s just hard to get advancement in the company ! Managers can be pretty hard depending on what store your working at. It all depends on location
good,"I work as a cashier at Publix. This is a great place to work for students as Publix will work around school hours. Also, you can work on the weekends. Also, this a good place to work for your first job. It was for me."
good,"Ensured the produce department provided the highest quality product and delivered the highest level of service to customers"
good,"Publix Provides you with great benefits while working there. As a manager you are on call all the time, even after a 50 hour work week. Management style varies from store to store."
good,"Pros- Some of the best benefits that you will find short of a government job. Some of the greatest personalities you will ever meet."
good,Publix worked with me and my schedule for school and college classes. You can pick your own schedule and work when you need to. There have been a lot of changes in the company that are not favorable to the employees but it got me through school and gave me vital skills in customer service and how to handle different situations with different types of people.
good,Its not the best job but its also not bad. It's a good place to start off at and even stay at if you don't want to finish school. They want their employees to grow in publix and kinda push it but not everyone wants to stay and grow.
good,Certain jobs are better than others in the company. Delivery driving is low stress but competitive. Seasons of long and short hours. Standards keep changing but it's hard to figure out if they're changes for the better
good,"Working for Publix has been perfect for me as a college student. My only issues are that we are almost always understaffed and it is hard to get promoted. Most people I have known that have gotten promoted have taken 5+ years to get promoted to managerial positions. A lot of favoritism when it comes to distributing hours. They want you to dedicate your lives to Publix but do not want to pay you fairly for it. Evaluations where you get raises are every 6 months but these raises are contingent  on minuscule things that take off points so you do not reach certain pay thresholds. Again, great for students/part timers. But awful if you want to make a career out of Publix."
good,One of the easiest jobs for a high school student. Management team is great and just the overall environment is reliable and feels close-knit (the employee-customer relationships).
good,Publix has great benefits and job opportunities. It is a place where you can work your way up the latter and they provide the resources as long as you are putting in the effort and commitment.
good,"Publix has taught me good time management skills.  Becoming a full-time employee is difficult unless you are going into management in a department."
good,It requires a lot of standing but it is a good job. The managers at my publix are very nice and they have an open door policy. The company is great and all the workers are very pleasant to be around.
good,"Allowed two days off a week but not on weekend"
good,The management can be overwhelming and immature. The amount of drama that takes place within some areas is nonsensical and irrelevant to the work goal
good,publix is a good place to work. Very good benefits and long term benefits of staying with the company. The work life balance is challenging once you get into management.
good,"Fun place to work. The pay started of low, and the raises are very small. They let me work until I was eight and a half months pregnant and offered me to come back."
good,"Publix is an amazing place to work. Most of the problems this company has been with the management, some Publix's have undisputable management and have no respect for their subordinates. Some stores, on the other hand, are great, but management does not get good training. A lot of the older workers are lazy as well so..."
good,"My days at work were a little stressful. I learned that if you are not genuinely happy at a place you work, you should not work there. It does not meet my goal."
good,You and your coworkers become a family. Everyone is nice and friendly. Not much competition except between stores. It is a quick paced work environment. You have to be able to work under pressure
good,I worked and am still working at Publix as a deli clerk.  I work evenings after school and on the weekends.  The work was easy and I use my bilingual Spanish skills to help a lot.
good,if you are in school this is a nice place to work they help pay for schooling pay weekly but the hours could use a little work on distribution. just a typical grocery store job just with a little extra on it.
good,"The Publix culture goes back 75+ years of customer service backed by an incredible guarantee. "
good,"Publix pays you to do almost everything when it comes to training. If you do anything extra, they will give a free meal. The benefits seem pretty good."
good,"I believe it was a great job, but as time went on management changed and I was taken advantage of and I was basically forced to leave emotionally because I could not take the treatment any longer. But it was a very stable safe and beneficial job. The company is great but certain individual managers were not."
good,"Providing premier customer service, including greeting them and responding to questions"
good,"Very good place to work, but you have to think like they do. Managers tend to be of a particular sort (White southern Christian males, preferably over 6' tall) and the company has even been sued over this in the past. Very Stepford-Wives-ish, cult like. Everyone is expected to participate in corporate events (fundraising, habitat homes, etc.) if they wish to move up. Deli employees buck these trends and tend to be quite miserable as a result."
good,Its a bust job especially on holidays. Get paid weekly and have a chance to move around to different areas in the company it a fast pace job but it is has good job security get a raise base on your evaluation if you haven't gotten any write ups or complaints
good,"Publix gave me a great opportunity to get my feet off the ground in the world, being my first job. As a minor it is very hard to get good job opportunities. With Publix they made sure I felt comfortable and helped me out with my busy life with school. The only problems came with a lack of communication with management. It was often hard to change my schedule and when I did I was greeted with a very cold feel. But all in all I’d definitely recommend publix"
good,I only worked at one Publix location and it's a great company to work for. The managers genuinely cared about their employees and wanted them to be great. The company is very good at promoting from within so if you are ever interested in a management position and do well at your job there is a good chance of a promotion. Publix also offers a lot of great benefits to their employees and you are able to purchase stock within the company.
good,"Not a bad place to work for the wage, but hours are not consistant. Raises come sparsely and not very great.The management were pretty much adaptable to scheduling."
good,"Only if you manage to become full time is Publix worth it. The pay is not enough. The full extent of benefits are only applicable to full timers. The company is not bad and you can get raises fairly quickly, but you may end up there ten years before they ever consider making you full time. It’s just not fair."
good,The benefits arent for everyone like it use to be. You have to work enough credit hours to qualify for certain kinds. Have patience to deal with customers and especially the managers.
good,Part time employees do not receive quite as many benefits as full time employees but it is still a very good company to work for long term. The hours are suitable for working parents as well.
good,"I have enjoyed working with Publix through the various departments (Produce and Aprons) I feel that the work environment is strict but for a reason, the whole store runs like a clock when people are on time and performing their duties. Publix gives a chance for young students to get good work experience and income."
good,"Not having a set schedule is the only issue for me . We don’t get any discounts , customers could be a little bit nicer to the hard working associates!"
good,"Pays enough for someone living rent free, barely so for those who do pay rent. Customer Service management at my particular store stood out to me as unprofessional; however the overall management was very professional and courteous. The way that the scheduling was presented was fantastically done."
good,Good place to work....pay isn't that great for the part time employee. Takes too long to advance and make the real money. Hours are sometimes up and down
good,publix is a great company to work for with a great working enviorment and staff. a culture that not only starts at th top through managers but is visible even in the entrey position.
good,"The warehouse which I work at has been on a steep decline. Management is extremely poor, managers are willing to cut corners and do things that aren't acceptable otherwise. Management is more like the police rather than an associate. Benefits are great, free lunch, stocks, PTO, pay could be better. Good atmosphere with other associates."
good,"When I first started the job the pay was great for a young teenager. Now that im older the pay is not as much as I need now that im older. Overall, the employers and managers are good but the pay is not what it should be."
good,"Briefly, I like where I work. The environment is generally positive (if you can separate yourself in terms of where negativety is). Got benefits part time. Unfortunately I only close. Difficult to advance in a highly competitive environment. The opportunity to advance is there."
good,"The deli isn’t where you want to be, that’s really all I have to say. I had spoken with multiple other people who’d been there for years and we’re dissapointed at how things were managed. Between poor judgements or lack of noticing their efforts to stand out."
good,Customers and co workers were great. Good work life balance along with good benefits if employed full time. I personally was pat time so no paid time off for me.
good,"The hours are different almost daily 6-3 one day, 10-7 the next, then 6-3 again. There is preferential treatment and rules are broken often by managers. Ex: Promotion of relatives of managers who work directly under that related manager. No exceptions are made for employees with disabilities such as deafness. It is very cut throat with the customer base Publix has. There are high expectations and high demands for working on the weekends and later evenings. It was not good as far as hours were concerned for me as a single mom. Many Saturdays and Sundays I would work 10 hours or more to suit the needs of the bakery. Mother's Day and Easter, I worked as the mangers niece in the bakery got to be off every holiday. You must be on time at all costs, 4 minutes late clocking in is considered late and if you are late 3 times or more, there are consequences which gradually escalate to unpaid time off at 3 late notations and termination by 8 late clock ins. You must stand all day except for your lunch breaks and bathroom breaks. It is not for everyone for sure but it is not the worst place to work."
good,"Overall Publix is a good company to work for, but it is very difficult to receive enough hours as a part-time associate. I would like to be employed somewhere with more hours to work."
good,"-Overseeing stock clerks to ensure accomplishment of assigned tasks."
good,I worked for Publix for a brief tenure but in that short time frame I learned a lot in regards to customer service. I learned how to deal with angry customers and those who have the intent to steal.
good,Worked in fresh pack to start - was then promoted to CLERK II and did scheduling for many employees - Long hours especially during the holidays - but it was a great place to work
good,"A decent place to work for someone who needs flexibility in their schedule, but it is hard to advance your career at Publix. Tuition reimbursement is awesome."
good,A good part time stepping stone for me while I made enough money to go to electrician school to become a full time electrician a place were I could learn what the workforce was all about.
good,"I enjoyed working at Publix all throughout my highschool years. I started at 14, which is a plus for the company, especially if you want to learn independence. The coworkers were friendly, but I didn’t like the front end managers much. The store managers were very nice and they work with students on schedules which was great for me because I did many extracurricular activities."
good,"Overall I enjoyed the Publix culture and the amount of respect I was shown from management."
good,"very busy and complex but good at keeping you on your toes"
good,If you're willing to put in the work Publix provides great opportunity to make a very comfortable income. They teach great values when it comes to customer service which brings great dividends all over within a career at Publix or anywhere else.
good,"As a full-timer you will be working holidays ,weekends and nights..so it can be difficult if not impossible to spend quality time with family.Requesting time of doesn't mean you  will get approved"
good,There are many long term employees who will be able to retire better financially than I will be able to do.  There is a positive atmosphere.  I was expecting things to be run differently and better than a previous large corporation but things are pretty much the same or perhaps a little worse. I like working with the customers but there are too many things to do in a typical day and I am not very fast.
good,"This wouldn't be a fair review because I believe where I worked was an anomaly."
good,Shopping there is great. Working there wasn't what I expected. All depends on your Manager and how hard you're willing to push yourself. Working for free is frowned a pon but expexted
good,"It's a decent place and full of hard-working individuals. The typical day is quite hectic and long but the harder the workers are, the easier the day seems."
good,"Morning's when I open up the department I  make sure everything is ready for the customers. After i give out morning duties to my employee's I go and start to manager my deparment. Hardest part of my job is knowing a customer is not satisfied, I will go above and beyond to make sure that customer walks out happy and knowing they will return."
good,"If you work at a good store, it's a great job. It also depends on what department you work in. The people in the deli have a different experience in customer service."
good,I worked for Publix starting at 15 years old as a cashier. It was great as a student and teenager. I came back to the company when I was in my 20's. Still enjoyed everyone I worked with. My parents have worked for Publix since their 30's and will retire comfortably thanks to the 401k plan and stock.
good,"I clocked in went to work and looked to see when my break was. I usually closed and had to finish other people's work before I got to my own. But I got it all done in a timely manner. I learned how to mix the dough for the bread and a little bit about baking and decorating. Most of the management was fine, I had a small problem with the grocery manager when I first started for using fowl language and giving me a hard time instead of training me. He was relocated shortly after I brought this to my store manager's attention. I had a request off declined by the bakery manager once but when I let the store manager know that I would not be in on that day he fixed the schedule for me. I had submitted the request over a month in advance."
good,"A great place to work but really hard on your body , for the most part you really earn your pay at Publix which is a good thing especially if you’re a go getter ."
good,"Publix is a fine place to work while in college. It is also a great place to work if you want to move up the latter and make good money as a manager. The trend in getting rid of full-time positions is troubling, and the stock losing value in the past few years is troubling. If I was planning on making this a career, I'd be worried."
good,"It's a good place to work with competitive pay, some managers are sympathetic to associate needs. There is some favoritism at the publix I worked at that's why I left."
good,Publix has a good well earned reputation. There is however a lack of growth opportunities. the days are long but go by quickly and there is opportunity to interact with patients.
good,"I love this company , I would recommend this company to anyone looking for work..Publix take care of the their employees!! I live the pharmacist that I’ve worked with !!!"
good,"all depends on the manager, most of the time it was a decent place to work, kinda laid back. other employees were chill and fun to work with, a lot of inside jokes and chatter"
good,I enjoyed my time there at Publix. They have a lot of team building events where they go out and do stuff for the community. Big donators for local food banks. The company loves to give back to the community and create a very good experience with their customers.
good,It's a fun and stressful place to work at but good for a first job. Publix strives to be a unique supermarket and their customer service really is better than most.
good,in publix there is a lot of ways to cross train and to learn many more things about publix. it is filled with opertunitys to work in other departments.
good,"There aren't many cons to working for this company. The environment is quick and challenging- friendly competition kept morale alive and pumping. the hardest part of being a deli clerk is dealing with a customer who hasn't had the best day, but those situations can always be made positive with the right frame of mind."
good,"Most interactions with managers are positive. My coworkers, for the most part, were pleasant. There can be some interdepartmental strain. Overall, if you are willing to progress within Publix and are willing to move there are plenty of advancement opportunities. But, most positions are still retail positions."
good,if you’re looking to make money this isn’t the spot.  this is a place just to hold you over but it’s also a great place to work and start for young person
good,"Few managers preach company policy and adhere to it. Most acquire their own set of ""rule"" that they want you to follow. But with all jobs, you have associates that just want a paycheck and don't really care about the work they perform. Managers have their favorites and they seem to get promoted or hired through personal desires instead of work ethic, abilities or sense of urgency to complete any given tasks."
good,"Publix is a very good company to work for because of the benefits and publix stock...  Although i do feel that publix does not care for the employees as they used to when George Jenkins was alive, I feel that they have gotten very greedy an lost sight of who makes the business grow, and that would be the associates  working hard everyday to make pubix there future and job security....I love my job as a pharmacy technician and enjoy helping my customers feel good,laugh and put a smile on there face,, even though they are not well with a cold,flu or what ever they might be going thru.....The Management has really gone down on there need to help us grow and do a better job for our future growth with the company.... the most enjoyable part of my job is the customers..."
good,"Good company to work for. Hours are tough on family life. Management schedules are all over the place you may work nights,mornings or mid shifts. You work a lot of full weekends."
good,"A place that is alway hiring that is good to work at. People of every age currently work, and is a place that supports good organizations like the spcial olympics and march of dimes."
good,Publix is a great place to work. They allowed me to mold my work schedule around my class schedule and didn't attempt to force me to work outside of my availability.
good,Great Place to shop not such a Great Place to work. No work to life balance unable to create a workable schedule during family crisis even if you arranged reliable shift coverage.
good,a good place to work but depending on the store some managers are not talkative to customers or staff just to other managers. costumers want recognition fro the managers to feel appreciated same with the employees.
good,it was great to work with my fellow employees but not so much the managers. Managers changed very quickly to where you do not get to know them very well
good,Retail is what it is. The company is not what it once was but that has some pro and cons to it like most companies do. Gone are the days where there are bonuses to shoot for each period. Instead the pay was raised overall for everyone to be more competitive. Management is ok depending on store. Assistant managers are ferried between stores like cattle (similar to Kroger unfortunately so don't be surprised if you see that).
good,Overall Publix is a great place to work. But as a part time employee it can be pretty tough and the hours can be inconsistent. I would love to continue working for them in their corporate office.
good,"The Deli is usually fast paces and there are a lot of customers to keep up with along with your cleaning duties. I always took care of customers first. The customer always comes first at Publix, you have to greet with a smile and help them to the best of your abilities. The hardest part of the job are call outs, there is a lot to do, when someone doesn't show, there is usually a good bit of slack to pick up. The best part of the job is making a grumpy customer happy. I have learned a lot about helping unhappy customers and assisting them to make them happy by the time they leave.There is a lot to learn there and they are great for teaching."
good,"Publix was a great place to work, but to truly advance at a place such as that, you have to really devote your time to the company. A typical day at work consisted mostly of cashiering or bagging for customers and providing excellent customer service, something Publix takes pride on. You will learn a lot about specific customer service tactics, money-handling tactics, and other services that will effectively keep the store working. Management is a mixed bag, you will have great managers who will want to see you proceed in your career, and others that will push you. The hardest part of the job is probably helping clean the store, but it's very worth it to make sure the customers have a clean place to shop, which is probably the most enjoyable part of the job: seeing happy customers."
good,"Balanced cashier's tilts, prepared for following day, prepared bank deposit and change order for pickup, cashiered when necessary and provided change to cashiers."
good,it just a typical work day but need more money and hours plus the management sucks and is great place 2 work thats why i willin 2 try something differents
good,Great place to work if you have good managers to help you advance. Publix can be a great place or not so great depending on your managers. I have had great managers and enjoyed working there and I have had bad managers that make it miserable. Some departments are a little easier than others but your experience here will be determined by how well your managers can do their jobs and how well they treat you and other employees.
good,"The workplace culture at Publix, at least at my specific location, was very inviting. My coworkers and managers were very encouraging and welcoming. To be fair I wasn't working there for long, however, that impression was quite strong. I learned the importance of being able to communicate with fellow employees more effectively."
good,"I worked in the stores for 5 years and was a warehouse selector for a year, so I got to see both sides of the business. If anyone's looking for a job there, go for it. If you're looking for a long-term career, be ready for a grind."
good,"What can I say, great starter job, they will teach you discipline. and are flexible when it comes down to school. So a good place for a high school kid to choose as their first job"
good,Can be very competitive; very busy and fast paced. Possible management promotions. Hard to have a family life. Good stock options. relocation benefits
good,"good company just no room for advancement and you max out of your pay, they expect too much from you working retail and puts alot on the techs, but overall was alot better than other retail pharmacies"
good,Taking care of customers. maintaining cleanliness of registers and surrounding areas. customer service and team work. this job was always met with a good attitude and nice people
good,"I have been with Publix a little more than 6 months. This is a part-time job for me however the company does promote advancement from within the company and offers tuition reimbursement and other incentives. Overall, I believe it to be a good company. The one thing I found surprising is that they do not offer employee shopping discount."
good,"Amazing company to work for, but like so many other companies, will not fire the people not doing the job. Too worried about the world's view of them. The company provides great advancement opportunities if you want. Your success is truly in your hands."
good,Good pay until you move into customer service.  Customer service staff should be paid more considering their job duties.  Overall it was a great first job.  Learned a lot.
good,Working for Publix isn't bad as long as you have a good working environment. I've worked with awful co-workers and managers. It's fast pace and slow pace working environment depending on the day of the week and the time of day. You start a minimum wage or can get paid by experience.
good,"Great  place to work.  I learned different areas of the company and the wharehhouse, I will suggest this work place to anyone, that loves  working ..."
good,"I used to love this company but when they started caring more for the customers than their employees I no longer want to work for them, I am looking for a long term career job a place that will allow me to grow and acknowledge me when I am doing good not only when I mess up."
good,At Publix customers are respected like a king. Every customers are VIP in Publix. Employees are happy in their working environment so do the customers. I recommend this market for everyone. Publix is a place where working and shopping is a pleasure.
good,"Its very stressful but its worth it, they have alot careers u can choose from thats good but any little thing they will write u up thats why employees dont last"
good,"Working at my home store pharmacy was very fun. I really enjoyed the company of my manager, and a few of the other technicians. It was as lighthearted of a situation as possible in that field. The environment was busy, extremely fast paced, and hectic at times, but I do very well under pressure. Plus, I have gained an incredible amount of patience and knowledge with respect to customer service. All in all, the pharmacy was a productive and fun work place, but the extent of enjoyment one experienced in this job environment, was almost entirely dependant upon the staff you were required to work with."
good,"As a teenager looking for a job fresh from 16, Publix was perfect for my life. I was still in school and the hours are flexible, leaving me to be able to complete homework, hang out with friends, and even further my education on the side."
good,"Typical work day is good but can be hectic during rush hours."
good,Publix is a good place to work.  If you value work/life balance and a family person it may not be the place for you.  It all depends on where you are in your life.
good,I've been with Publix for over 30 years. For the most part they are very accommodating. Any job is what you make of it. Although at times you feel unappreciated and underpaid. The payscale is usually fair and unbiased.
good,"I very much nice place t work, sometimes great hours and sometimes not. Management was good but they always are and went jus when you get to like them. the coworkers were great i always got along with them ."
good,"Truly a great first starter job, a little hard to advance all depends on your manger and your attitude. Definitely a college job, unless you pursue to advance."
good,"I've been in retail for many years and I can say Publix defiantly raises the bar when it comes to exceptional customer service.  "
good,I personally did not enjoy working there because of how coworkers and customers treated me. They started to drop my hours with no given reason. It was a very stressful environment for me.
good,"Publix is a great company to work for if you plan on working there your entire life. Compensation is low for most positions and health coverage is not great but they make up for it in retirement and stock options. Management is okay, job security is great, but if you want to move up you better be in good with the right people. It's all about who you know."
good,"They will sometimes work with your schedule depending on who the managers are. Some can be understanding. On your availability sheet even when you put that you can't work on certain days, you still end up working those days."
good,"Customer Service at its highest level was a requirement to be able to fit in.  However, if you like working with public, it is rewarding and pleasant by interacting well with customers while emphasizing customers satisfaction."
good,I worked there through high school and all my adult life. Transferred to another division only to try and transfer back after putting in 12 full time years and became a driver to be told I had to start over at the bottom.
good,"Publix is a great company to work for, but you have to know people in order to move up within the company. The benefits are also a great plus here at Publix."
good,This was a good job but sad that I didn't have the weekends available and had to move on. Very proud of working for publix. Its Great company and policy
good,"The work i am required to do is not hard, but as production from other  areas pick up us as packers short handed have to speed up. there is no way to excell in the company."
good,Publix provided a safe and clean environment in which to work. Management was very respectful and assisted in training. Provided opportunities to cross train for other departments.
good,"Publix is a good place to work when starting out in a career field. But over time you may find it difficult to move up in the company, so you may need to look for work in another company in the future."
good,"This job has challenged me physically and in my prioritizing skills. Although we are staffed with several other clerks each day, we all have separate tasks that need to be completed before the end of our shift. During our seasonal months, those tasks seem impossible to finish but, when prioritized properly, it can be done in a timely and efficient manner."
good,it is a different culture in florida than tn. the only true negative for this company is the management. it is very clique oriented. pay is decent for the job and the people are fairly pleasant
good,Good company to work for. Friendly Customers. That's the most enjoyable part. Hardest part about the job is not having enough help in the department and having to work as 2 or 3 people.
good,Loved working for this company! I had some awesome managers who genuinely showed concern for your progression in the company. It was a first job for me and I was fortunate to work for such a nice company starting out in the work force!
good,"Overall publix is great, my manager just sucks. I believe its probably the publix i work for. I feel as if they are unfair at tiimes when it comes to the workers, and they play with peoples hours."
good,"Excellent place to work if you are a full time employee.  Great benefits.  Employees and Employers enjoy a family type atmosphere."
good,I enjoyed My job immensely at Publix. The team was great. Work schedule was usually set up well. Very fast paced on busy days and very slow on slow days. Part time seems to be the most popular to be hired as. Full time is difficult to attain unless you have complete availability.
good,I always enjoyed to working  in this compagny. it was a really good pleasure for me to go there overtime. everybody respected each other especially the manager
good,Working at Publix is not a bad job. You are on your feet and going all the time. Always something to do and new things to learn everyday. Seems like a lot to learn at first but you catch on.
good,Publix as a company is good to work for. Their management not so much especially if your not on their good side but that's every where you go so good luck
good,"I liked the company itself, particularly the values behind it and the benefits package they offer. Like most companies however, my particular store suffered from a bad management team, which can bring down the overall experience. Money wasn't particularly good but it was better than other starting jobs like Mcdonalds, department stores, etc. All in all, a good company to work for, and the longer you work for them the better it gets."
good,"Working at Publix can be rewarding. Management tries to recognize your effort, but customers tend to be more appreciative. Managers are really good about working with you with your schedule."
good,Fast paced job with great benefits. Several different jobs to grow in. Management is nice. workdays are hard with rotating schedules does not give you much time off.
good,There is always something to do.  The challenges of the particular store that I worked in seemed insurmountable due to the language barriers. The most enjoyable part to the job was seeing my associates excel in their area of expertise.
good,"Provided Great customer service. Learned how to make subs. Sliced, served and packaged specialty meats, salads"
good,"I enjoy working with Publix. The company does what it can to take care of the employees as well as customers. The cons, however would be some of the managerial staff. Some of the managers got into their positions due to favoritism rather than work performance."
good,"A typical day at work can be very boring or very busy depending on your shift. I learned that Publix is a great part time job for high school students. The management is great but the higher ups don't really recognize your or your service. The culture is okay, usually high school kids. The hardest part of the job is dealing with your supervisors because they're also kids. The enjoyable part is the amount of freedom you get while at work."
good,"Great place to work, job keeps you on you toes.Worker are helpful and friendly.You get to meet lost of new people. The hardest part of the job is learning all the deli meats and cheese and the different name of each sandwich."
good,"It is a good place to work while in high school and if a grocery store is where an individual would like to make a career out of. A typical work day is coming in looking at the schedule to see what I am doing ten get straight to it whether I come in the office or bag groceries or get on a register. Management is good for the most part besides a few of them having their favorites and not seem willing to help associates move up. Workplace culture is pretty diverse. This job is pretty easy, I can't really think of a hard task. The most enjoyable part of the job is being around the fewest positive co workers there and customers sharing their experience with you."
good,"I worked very well with employees and managers.  I decorated cakes, waited on customers assisted with bakery work and closed the store.  Manager could have been screened more for employment."
good,A typical day at work   consists of  assisting our customer's with their shopping so that they can have a wonderful shopping experience. I have learned that our customer's are the driving force of our business.Our management staff is very professional.They provide a very comfortable working culture. The hardest part of the job is when we encounter a unhappy customer that bad mouths the company. Interacting with our customers and getting to know them in a personal level is the most enjoyable part of our job. we build relationships with them.
good,"Great place to begin a career, excellent potential for advancement and pay. Don't start a family, you will never see your kids. Long hours, weekends, holidays etc."
good,"Clock in, go straight to the floor, find a register that needs a bagger, bag until its time for lunch, by the end of the day it was time for my chores"
good,There are many job opportunities at Publix. Many growth opportunities as well. My one negative about Publix is the pay and benefits. But other than that Publix is a good place to work.
good,"Publix is a good company to work for if you don't mind working in a grocery store. They give raises once a year, and overall they treat their employees well. You usually start as a bagger (someone who bags groceries) and move up to a cashier in a year. You'll still have to get carts and bag groceries as a cashier. There are also other departments that you can transfer into like back stock and produce if cashiering isn't your thing."
good,"There really isn't a ""typical"" day of work at Publix. There are several different jobs one can do. You can be a cashier, front service clerk, or work in departments. I have learned a lot about how good of a company like Publix can be. The only draw back is if you are not in management, and there can only be a few out there compared to the total group of employees, you can only make so much money. It may not be enough to live on. Benefits are very good. The one drawback I can think of is even though there is a possibility to advance, for most, it doesn't, and can't happen (there are only so many slots to fill). Dealing with the customers is the best part of the job, and the insurance is great. The coworkers can be like family, as well. Overall, Publix is a nice place for someone to work. If someone wanted to go there, I'd recommend it to them."
good,I enjoyed working at Publix.  I loved my teammates.  The management for the most part was fantastic but then there were some that needed work on their personalities.  I feel that you have to have a very strong happy go lucky attitude to work anywhere with the public.
good,As an hourly associate it is an excellent place to work.  They pay well and give you a share of stock per paycheck. However when you become salary it's a whole other ball game. Forget about family life.
good,Good company to work for! Everyone is extremely nice and try to go above and beyond to help in what ever way you need help.Working with this company is a good way to get your feet in the door and also to start learning about all the different aspects that go on within a business.
good,"Being a cashier at Publix is a great job that doesn't have a lot of requirements. It's nice that they pay more than minimum wage. Your day depends a lot on the customers (nice customers = good day). Management is average. I've developed great people/communication skills while working here. I've also gained good skills in dealing with money and transactions. My coworkers are decent, definitely like some a lot more than others, there are also a few that are just awful. Hardest part? Extreme couponers and awful customers. Best part? Security (somewhat), and to be able to say that I work for such a well respected company."
good,"Publix has a lot to offer, many different jobs and pay scales. I really enjoyed work for this company and would do so in the future under the right circumstances. My only issue and the main reason for me retiring from this company at 30 years old was management. Not all managers are bad but recently in the warehouse the selection hasn't been the best."
good,This is a great corporation to work for when one is just entering the workforce. This company teaches its employees essential people skills as well as professional and organizational skills.
good,Remember to do your best. Always put customers first and everything will work out fine. Punctuality is also key at publix.
good,"Good job, teaches you people skills, not hard work but requires positive attitude and standing for long periods of time. Compensation is ok but there is opportunity for promotion."
good,I enjoy the people I got to meet. The work was alright for a job. Management I started out with was amazing but the new management was a let down.
good,Started this job in high school. A place for an advancement if interested. Appreciation is shown on the lower level of management. Sometimes upper management made it hard for employees. Overall was pleased with my work.
good,"i work in specialites and they have unrealistic expectations of a specialities person, especially for someone who is part time and no benefits."
good,The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers who have no respect for others around them and create a bad environment for others.
good,"start my day by giving me a register, i say hello to everyone smile and ask how there day was and if they need help with anything. after i scan there items and continue if no ones there i stand in front a say hello to anyone that passes and wait for the next customer."
good,"Great company to work for , but location is everything. Go for a slower volume store ! Great part about the place is that they promote from within"
good,Great place to work as a minor unless you really love the company and wish to grow and become a manager at the location. Advancement comes with hard work and Publix owners and managers can see those deserving of the positions.
good,"This job is a job where you get paid based on how fast and efficient you work.  Typical day is finding out case count, stretching, picking orders, assisting with the completion of the night, then clock at 6 to 14 hrs later. Man up and stop complaining like a hoe. This is a good job for people who want good money."
good,"Overall, it's a good company but I need a job with quicker career advancement. "
good,"I liked the job and who I worked with at the time. I would not change that all, at time it was hard to both when we got busy. But I still enjoyed what I did]"
good,"I have known many people who really love their job at Publix. I enjoy it also at times. Interaction with customers can be pleasant, and the coworkers get along for the most part. The hardest part of the job is probably focus. While stocking shelves, or whatever your duty at the time, there are customers that constantly interrupt and ask questions. While distracting, it is also rewarding. While that can be the hardest part of the job, helping someone find what they are looking for can also be the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,I worked for Publix for 9 years mostly in the meat dept it was a good experience to get your verbal skills up and test your product knowledge also safety was very important I'm proud to say I did all my years with no work place accidents and personally I strive for this I'm looking now to expand my career horizon and will like the opportunity to find another good job that I can possibly be on for 9 years or more Publix is overall a good place to work and offers job sablity
good,"Depending on the pace of the day, you might be a Cashier or a Bagger. Either or is a nice duty to have."
good,"I actually loved working there! The environment, people, & other associates were fun to be around. The customers were friendly also"
good,"One of the best place to work it's a nice environment and publix take very good care of their costumers, very good management, and peaceful place to work"
good,I loved working here but I relocated to Tallahasse so that I could attend school and they pulled the rug from under me by going back on my transfer this was very disappointing to me.  No job security
good,employees and customers always have a conversation with us and can make you laugh and smile also learn how to  stock how to talk to peopleyou have to have patience with customers and learned that every customer is not the same customers
good,"Constructive feedback, ad layout, strong typography feedback, being able to work together with a team of designers was very enjoyable"
good,They make sure you know what your job title consist of and they give you proper tools and training in order to execute your task in an appropriate time
good,not a good balance in job and family life.  very hard to spend time with family.  need to spend more time with family.  schedule can change at a moments notice.  no set schedule it changes weekly
good,"Productive workplace with great co-workers, everyone functions like a family and only separated by departments. Learned a lot about customer service and picked up many problem solving skills. Management was overall well as long as you do your part."
good,"The company is excellent, but stores vary. Management makes or breaks the store. The pay is good for retail, the benefits are good if you're full time. Advancement is all political, and not nearly as concerned with work ethic or productivity as it should be. Good place to start, but very difficult to grow."
good,"Managers not always supportive of your desire to advance. Many don't help mold you into a manager. Many managers have favorites and discriminate. Co-workers can complain a lot. Work is hard, not an easy job but rewarding. Managers have your back when it comes to customer relations. The hardest part is standing all day, lifting, and no breaks if you don't smoke. The most enjoyable part is working with customers who appreciate your hard work."
good,"If you don't mind not having normal hours.....people are great. Management can be tricky. If you get a good one, you're lucky. Unable to get days off during holidays...big no no."
good,The culture at Publix is one-of-a-kind.  Customers are top priority and it is great to be part of a company that is employee-owned.
good,"A typical day was a lot of running and stacking, learned a lot about Publix as a company. Management was great at times but not all the time, i loved all my co-workers and the hardest part was having to wake up at 2am to go to work. The best part to me was the free all you can eat launch and the high weekly pay."
good,"Some customers are really rude. Managers take carry out a little too serious but it is what it is, Managers are to focused on money rather than employee health or appreciation. Would want you to come in even when sick, or got agitated when in the hospital."
good,"I am typically happy with my environment. I would like to learn more in my current position in order to be more confident, but I learn much of what I know on my own."
good,"not thrilled how they handled a few issues I had family oriented,"
good,"If you are looking to be disciplined and told what to do like a child, go for it! If your willing to clean a lot, go for it!  Now staff is pretty friendly, co workers are awesome always willing to take/ swap shifts!  But the scheduling system , chuck it out the window!  But if your a college student and or High school student GREAT place for you to work!"
good,"The good: Management was willing to work with you if you were willing to work with them. I tried to be as dependable as possible, and it helped me get raises when we had our evaluations. They knew that if I was calling in sick, then I was sick. It was a great experience to learn how to deal with people, even though a lot of people that came in were snobby. My favorite part was bagging groceries. It was like doing a puzzle, and I always tried to beat my own internal score of how fast I finished."
good,"Publix is a grocery chain. I'm a part time stocker in this grocery chain. My typical day was me going in and stocking shelves and dealing with multiple customers at once. "
good,Publix is a great place to work. The stores themselves are clean. The associates are friendly and inviting. They offer great benefits and opportunity to grow.
good,"You meet a lot of people at Publix. Depending on the area you work in dictates the work culture and often times the employees; in some cases. The benefits are great. The only downfall is the amount of hours you must get to reap the benefits especially if you are a part-timer."
good,"Publix has many great benefits and many opportunities to advance or go into different area in the Publix entity. A typical day, well there never anything typical just always staying focused on the customer's need is what is important. Please the customer, because it is the reason they come back. Work can be stressful because one has to balance life and work. The hardest part of the job can be the rare occasion of dealing with an upset customer or not having certain items in stock. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you earn and keep your benefits and the associates become more like family."
good,"Publix has a great culture and background for their business plan. It's all about being higher quality and producing great customer service to bring people back. Overall, they are an excellent company to work for."
good,"Overall, I think Publix is a great company to work for. Although management can be poor at times, I had some amazing co-workers that made up for it. The hardest part of the job for me was dealing with associates who did not want to do their share of work, as well as dealing with associates who continuously tried to bring me down. I think the most enjoyable part of my job would be seeing certain customers. After seeing these people daily for almost 2 years, you really become a part of their lives, and they become a part of yours."
good,It's exactly what you would expect working in a grocery store. Doing the odd thing here or there talking to regulars. Putting things on shelves.
good,It is an okay entry level company. With no degree or work experience you can make a good living. Management is hit or miss.
good,Publix is an amazing place to work. If someone is willing they are able to put in the hard work and Publix will reward you for that hard work by moving you up the corporate ladder. Being able to do something new and exciting keeps the job fresh and keeps it from becoming a stale boring job that you have to attend everyday.
good,"I like this company. Its a good company. Of course things never stay the same but that's life. I do miss being there but life goes on."
good,Clock in and check with management on needed tasks. Assist customers while stocking shelves or changing for next sales week. I have learned more about grocery business than at my last grocery job. I work well with co-workers and have a good time while working. The hardest part of the job would be learning how the manager wants to organize backroom. Fellow co-workers and assisting customers along with accomplishing work load is what i enjoy.
good,"As a grocery store the upkeep and cleanliness is properly maintained and locating products is extremely easy."
good,Loved meeting new customers and customers becoming like family. Most of the time it was a enjoyable place to work. Day workers compared to night workers worked harder. A lot of tasks would not be completed come the next morning so management was not on top of things. Most of the time rules were changed up each day depending on who was in charge. Clean store and the customers came first. Most of the time thy worked with there employees concerning personal issues.
good,"Great benefits but the way that IT is structured there is minimal room for growth. Management encourages you to leave and then come back... They do not like you to think outside the box or make suggestion for room for improvment within IT. If you're looking for a great place to retire on the last stretch of your career this is it, otherwise don't think you're going to come here and move up in the chain.."
good,I started off as a cake decorator for almost a year. Making custom cake for customer orders. Took cake orders from customers. Made dessert items for cases to sell. Also made back up items so we wouldnt run out. Then switched to cashier because department was full and their was an opening for cashier.
good,"This place is all about working your way up from the bottom to the top.  I appreciate the fact that they will not hire someone in to be management, they make the cream rise to the top."
good,I am a loyal and honest worker who would like to move up to management and change the landscape for the work area as we know it. I want to be an employee that others look up to and respect.
good,Easy work once you learn your duties. Challenging at times. Co-workers would help often. Management was ok. Store managers were nicer though. The company itself is worth it if you want to advance although it takes years and years. I would have stayed if it didn't take so long to advance. Overall it is the best to work for.
good,Very willing to work with your schedule.  A lot of young workers.  Takes a long time to move up in the company.  Will take advantage of you if you let them.  Working on your feet for 10 hours a day is difficult.
good,I love my job and the people who i work with. but Working in a Deli is very physical hard work... and it is hard to be doing the work for me...  the most enjoyable part of my job is the customers that come in.. i love them to death
good,"My typical day consisted of packaging bread, doughnuts, cookies, etc. Answering the phones & setting up displays.I was able to put some money away into my 401K at the moment while working there."
good,"Publix Greenwise Marketplace is an excellent store to shop at and if you can adopt the Publix culture and bleed green it is an excellent place to work at especially with their 401(k) and employee stock purchase plans. However, if you do not put Publix before everything else (i.e. family, school) it is difficult to get ahead and advance within the company."
good,"Very fun place o work on a day to day basis, if you come in a do what you need to do you will be successful, very great benefits, and very good advancement opportunities"
good,Interesting job experience. Loved the fresh food and kind staff. Flexible hours.Unfortunately I did enjoy all the excitement and didnt want to leave. Fun calender days(holidays)
good,"A typical day was rush ,rush , rush to provide great customer service.Creating and maintaining the great product that Publix is known for. I work with a great group of people to include my supervisors."
good,It is not a bad company. Great company benefits. Very happy environment. But they do have some challenges as all jobs do. But i would recommend it to anyone
good,Great company to start building a strong work ethic. Flexible with school hours as education is a high priority as well as growth with the company.
good,worked in customer service where I coordinated front end. assisted with inventory orders and opened and closed the store.
good,customer service that's what their known for and they work very hard to earn and keep that title. They work very hard for the community.
good,"The company is a wonderful place to start during high school for a part time job. There are many opportunities to move up in the company, however, doing so is a slow process. "
good,Publix is an overall great company to work for. Great work and family balance. Great benefits and 401k plans. When it comes to the hours it can be a bit of a hetic schedule.
good,"On most days, managers are expected to complete production tasks, check email, write schedules, receive and record supply trucks, maintain accurate inventory levels, train associates, and maintain a full and fresh department,"
good,"I really enjoyed working for Publix. I liked the public my reviews were always good. But Publix had by-laws. This stated that pressing enter was considered a sale. We had to check birthdates for cigarettes and alcohol. But they said to store the order if the people were having problems with payment or i.d., I had three such occurrences in one year and was fired."
good,"Management seems to be changing a lot lately, so its been an up and down roller coaster. "
good,"Spent a lot of time on the road traveling to many different cities and states.  Learned quite a lot about the grocery industry.  Immediate management was very informed.  Didn't see co-workers often as I was traveling a lot, but my Assistant was spectacular.  Traveling 3-4 days a week was very hard on the home life but did enjoy seeing all the places I visited."
good,"As we all know, Publix is a great company, but its just now growing in Alabama.. Based in Florida, you can really tell - specially if you visit South Florida - that thing runs a little smoother over there because  Publix is part of their culture. Is almost a religion. Over here... not so much!"
good,"A typical day at Publix is loading and unloading 17 to 20 pallets of groceries that need to be broken down for our grocery crew to work. Sometimes your by yourself breaking these pallets down along with getting called/paged to find things for customers or to help customers out. Sometimes a vendor or two needs to be checked in, wants to review their orders on our Automated Replenished systems, or just want to try to sell you some displays. We have to make sure that our specials(BOGO's) stay filled(the reason why some shop with us), and other items that customers need daily. I've learned that sometimes the customer is not always right especially when you have documentation to back you up. I also learned that not everyone has the same mind set as you when it comes to getting the job done correctly and efficiently. The management team needs a little work. Communication isn't always there and that is important when you are sometimes left as the only one in charge. Not knowing what's going on, or who's stopping by to fix something gets frustrating after awhile. The associates(co-workers) at Publix can be fun. A lot of associates don't mind pitching in and helping. Some like to go help out in other departments or learn another department just in case someone in that department calls out. We like to have fun at work since it seems like we spend half of our lives there. The hardest part of my job is making sure that all of my associates know my expectations and deliver. Following up and making sure that things get accomplished is very important. It is real easy to get behind and we may"
good,Lots of responsibility for not enough pay. Depending on the department you may not be able to make a living wage even at full time.
good,A typical work day consists of either working through the back stock of inventory or stocking the shelves with new product. I've learned most of the basics for working in customer service and retail. Management isn't always the best and tend to sometimes give false promises on pay raise or advancement. Most co-workers are great to work with but some may be driven to produce unnecessary drama in the work place. The hardest part of the job is just managing your time and keeping your production up in your shift. The most enjoyable part of the day is when you can assist a customer or chat with them and you know that you've made them happy.
good,"Very friendly environment almost like a family."
good,"Overall one of the best comapanies I have ever worked for. The company has a decent starting wadge for enrty level positions at 7.90 an hour and after three months an employee, based on performance, recieves between a $0.15 to $0.50 raise and every six months after that is eligiable for another raise. All departments have advancement oportuntities within the department and the company offers lateral transfers to other store department based on abilities of associate and needs of the department. 401 K is aavailble upon completion of 1000 working hours and the company also offers basic dental, health, and optical benefits at a low pre-tax deduction from the paycheck. However the benefits are limited and co pays are high for the wadge that is paid. Weekly pay is a perk to this employers as well most associates will average at least 20 to 33 hours weekly. Most Publix management is resonable and committed to the employees success as well as their career advancement in the company. However, in a majority of cases advancement is given on senority and not always on talent or work ethic. One is eligiable to retire after 5 years with company and buy company stock"
good,"I enjoyed my place of work and how much I learned while employed there. I felt that my most recent manager was very disconnected from her leadership roles. Often employees would as questions that she could not answer and did not offer to find a solution. The company as a whole was amazing to work for, but doesn't have room for much advancement in the pharmacy."
good,Publix is a great place to work if you are a happy and cheerful person. People are always coming in and out and everyone loves the shopping experience at Publix.
good,"good for first job, learned a lot at the job and learned a lot of new responsibilities"
good,"In management I worked over 50 hours a week. Maintained day to day operations of department and in managers absence assumed roll of department head. Managed employees, enforced policies and procedures, maintained inventory and food safety."
good,Its a great place to work if you are just starting out in the job world or are just needing something to hold you over. But if you dont want to stay in Grocery your whole life then it starts to get frustrating
good,Interacting with customers is enjoyable. I've learned many different people and many different personalities. The management is above average and very kind. The co-workers are average. The hardest part of my job is not taking breaks within a long time distance.
good,"- I work at morning only 1 time for now"
good,"Good pay and benefits, okay hours, management was friendly to a professional extent. Co-workers helpful and lively, hardest part lack of social life, and lack of consistent schedule. The paycheck was the best part of the job."
good,"Publix is by far one of the best companies I have worked for. A typical day at Publix Distribution start off with a daily stretch, then in my department (the return center) I start unloading trailers, loading trailers, and recycle items such as plastic, paper, and wax materials. I have learned the importance of recycling and how money a retail company can really make off recycling everything. Management sometimes are well educated on policies but I guess you gotta take the bad with the good. My co-workers are unique and very with the Publix culture.Hardest part of my job is getting up at 4:00 in the morning.The most in enjoyable apart about my jobs is knowing that every time I get paid I'm investing in my future, because for every $324.00 I earn one share of stock; and now in days stock is just as good as credit if not better."
good,"The deli is a fun place to work. It gets hard at times and there is a lot to remember but you work in a team, directly with the customers. If you are hired on as a part timer it can be hard to get into full time, and with an job there are some bad apples in management. In my time there I had both good and bad managers, as well as good and bad team members, but overall it was a pleasant job."
good,This job is a great job to start out. Great advancement opportunities.
good,"First learned how to use an electric pallet jack and how to select using a headset,"
good,"Publix is a great place to work for single college students. My co workers were amazing and I absolutely adored my management team. On a typical day my responsibilities consists of maintaining a clean work environment, guide customers through aisles, cooking recipes revolved around particular ""on sale"" items, and working along side of my deli/meat departments to promote and boosts sales. It was a very laid back job that only required a little patience and customer service skill."
good,Publix is a very employee friendly company. The company is very customer focus.
good,It is a good place to work. I enjoying being on the move all day not sitting in one place. You work with great people and meet new people everyday.
good,Publix takes and interest in there people. if you are inspired to move up into management then they will help you achieve your goals.
good,Love my job and there is a chance of promotions and advancments. Have to be consistantly maintaing high marks on evals. Some time hard work can be over looked. so always stand out and above the crowd.
good,"•	Grocery replenishment specialist; managed designated inventory, stocked groceries, made grocery orders and managed automatic replenishment."
good,"A typical day at this job would be scanning customers' purchases and issuing them receipts. Assisting customers' locate products and resolving customer issues. I cashed checks, money orders, and completed money transfers."
good,i typically would be a a cash register ringing up customers grocery's. I also learned how to operate Publix PO system and keeping close relations with recurring customers. Management was nice and my co-workers were friendly.  The hardest part of my day was standing by the end of my shift. But i loved seeing and talking with the regular customers and building relationships for the company.
good,"Very much a customer service driven company. Lots of work to do.  I enjoyed working with the customers. Most likely you will start as part-time employee, then you can try to apply for full time position later in your career. You are able transfer to a different store if you are planning on moving. Manager's are transferred at random so you may have one manager for a year, then suddenly the next day there is someone new in charge. Towards the end of my employment I had a difficult time with new management."
good,"Very nice company to work for, like that they close everynight"
good,"As I started I learned that everyone knew what we were supposed to do everyday, the communication between my team was superb."
good,Loading/unloading delivery trucks.I learn inventory control and procedures. Management was unstable due to frequent changes with supervisors and managers. Co workers were easy to work with and good trainers. Hardest part was long hours. Company cook outs and hour long breaks were appreciated.
good,I have learned a lot about people at this job. You have your good and bad days as far as in dealing with customers and managers. Changing your schedule is never a problem unless you are full-time employee.
good,The benifits package is phenominal. Publix is a Forbes list of 100 Best Companies to Work for form 1998-2013. Publix culture of promoting from within and having never laid off an associate is something else as well as how they treat the associates. Life in management is very stressful as upper management only excepts the best and anything on par will not due. This makes the Life/Work balance very poor. When in management it is nothing to have to work 55-60 hours a week and sometimes more because if you have someone miss a shift then the manager has to make sure it is covered even if they have to do it.
good,"Order selecting, staging, shipping & receiving, training new employees, operating forklifts, pallet jacks and restocking merchandise"
good,"Hard physical work, but great benefits."
good,"A typical day at work begin with bagging customers groceries and take the groceries to the customers vehicles. Ive learned how to provide great customer service. Management is okay, they are like any typical management there are some managers who get on your nerves and some who leave you alone to do your work. the hardest part of the job is going outside whether its rain or shine, hot or cold. the most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers to find items."
good,"You have a very flexable schedule."
good,"being a bag boy at a supermarket was a great way to enter the workforce, by learning how to show up on time, greet customers, and give excellent service."
good,"60 percent mental 40 percent physical work, simple just go in stay focused and make your money."
good,"A day at Publix was usually a busy one filled with lots of one on one time with customers. I learned how to make specialty sandwiches and platters, how to operate all deli equipment, how to keep a positive attitude in stressful situations, and learned leadership abilities. Management in my opinion could have been stronger and smarter.I feel in a lot of situations they fell on us and failed to make the best decisions. In my eyes management is there for a reason and should be the leaders of the team, willing to do whatever it takes to see each situation go smoothly. Co workers either had very positive attitudes or very negative. More were concerned with dramatic non related work issues than the tasks at hand, which made the time at work much harder. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep it peaceful between co workers and management, there were far too many disagreements. The best and most enjoyable  part of the job was going above and beyond to help customers and see the hard work you did make them happy and wanting to come back. Overall Publix was a wonderful company to work for and I know the things I learned while there will help me in my future career."
good,"It was a good company for the most part. Do your job, and work hard, never had much family time"
good,"A typical day includes:"
good,A typical day working for Publix was very stressful at times. I learned that you should keep your personal life out of the workplace. The hardest part of the job was being the youngest co-worker in my department and not getting any respect.  
good,"A typical day at Publix is greeting my regular customers that I come into contact with. Greeting my co workers and management team. Getting to my cashier, checkign the amount I have in draw. As customers come in my lane I try my best to be a pleasure to them asking if they found everything ok. I also become very attentive to the cleanlessness of my work area making sure everything is organized. The hardest part of my day would be going outside to get carts because of the extreme heat. The most enjoyable day would be putting a smile on my customers face as the leave my register."
good,"My typical work day included assisting customers with food orders such as lunch meat, cheese, and fried chicken. Restocking coolers, and the floor such potato salads, tea, and chips. I learned premier customer service skills. Worked well with management and co-workers. "
good,"Come in at 6am. First off you check the special order bag of the day, and record the times of the orders. I then go out onto the sales floor and record the desserts production required to fill my designated area. I setup orders and work on sales production throughout the day making sure my time is managed properly. Cake Decorators are also required to pick up the department phone, and help any customer at the department at any time. Multitasking, and teamwork was always a big part of my day."
good,Company is a good one. Able to move and take on other jop positions.
good,Great 401K plan and stock options. But the company only cares about the customers and not their employees.
good,I love working at Publix! I met a lot of nice Co-workers and some good managers.
good,"great first time job for students, pay is better than average for initial employment, hours are extremely flexible and management cultivates an atmosphere of camaraderie. Good employees receive regular raises and opportunities to be trained up to other positions. management positions, however, are restricted to those with relevant business training. Full-time schedules are also rare."
good,"If you are full time in management then you are all set. If you only want part time and don't need benefits, you are all set. Very difficult if not impossible to get full time otherwise. As part time you don't get any accrued time, vacation, sick pay..nothing! Working for Hannaford up North part time you get all that even working part time. You get scheduled long hours and will get an hour off which is not needed. Ten hours...spread it out and get two 1/2's. Long time to be standing and you have to fight to get a ten minute break. You are not allowed to keep water at your register. You have to work so many hours to get health insurance and then still not guaranteed to keep up on hours to keep your health insurance. Love my store and store manager but it is certainly not what I expected from Publix and being a single mom..I need those hours and benefits. Sad because that's how they lose good workers."
good,"A great place to start out from high school, although probably not a place one could make a career of without further management training. Friendly environment and management is understanding and accustomed to varying schedule needs, as they employ many high school and college students. Sunday is extra pay, regular raises are in place for good performance. Above average compensation despite Part time nature of most jobs."
good,Slicing meat and cheeses maing subs and platers answering phone
good,"The company is very demanding, customer service, products they have to be bake on time, by 7 am everything has to be bake and all the displays has to be filled with the merchandise and products"
good,Great by industry standards. Current employer. Fast paced.
good,A day at work consist of me riding pallet jacks and selecting warehouse products needed to be delivered to Publix store's. I learned how to work pallet jacks and also how to use the computer system's on the forklift. Great management. The hardest part of the job was selecting in the warehouse during the summer season.
good,"I was typically a closer and my job duties consisted of a lot of multi tasking. My day consisted of assisting customers with their sandwich/deli orders as well as maintaining a clean workspace. I also took phone orders and worked in the kitchen. I learned how to safely use, filter and clean a fryer, flat top grill and rotisserie. I was also held accountable for the stocking and maintenance of the product on the floor as well. My Favorite part of this job was making the sandwiches. I got to really get to know a lot of new people."
good,The stability of Publix makes it always a good place to work.
good,"The stability of Publix makes it always a good place to work. The most difficult part was not being understood on an individual level, even in a smaller department. The work can get monotonous at times, but it is challenging."
good,"They recognize that in no way do the NEED you as an employee and are prepared to drop you at a moments notice. They only don't to uphold their reputation as a ""friendly and family oriented"" environment. They do cater to customer needs record breakingly well and their commitment to making the buyer happy should be an example to all. Most members of their higher staff however were not understanding of circumstance and failed to have that friendly predisposition that they prided themselves on being able to provide to customers when it came to talking to lower level employees."
good,A typical day at the store would be going in and fixing whatever it is the customers pulled from the shelves. Good things that you can learn from working here is people skills.
good,Good place to work. Daily work changed with seasons. Had to work anytime once in management. Other associates worked good. Hardest part was balancing work/home life.
good,"Medical Front Office Assistant Performs a variety of non-clinical duties in support of the Front Office at a very busy multi-provider ..............group practice located in .............Duties include: directing patients and visitors, Check-in and registration, scheduling, phone management, insurance verification, referrals, and Check-out/cashiering.

good,"When it comes to environment and benefits, Publix is the best company that I have ever had the pleasure of working for. You interact with hundreds of different faces everyday. The management varies by store are shifted around every few years."
good,i was a bagger for Publix. you had to fast but careful with handling the merchandise. i would sometimes load the merchandise in the customers vehicles for them if they wanted me too. the management wasnt the greatest but overall it was a really good first job for me
good,"Publix has been a great place to work for the past 6 and a half years. I have and continue to learn many skills everyday including but not limited to effective communication with both associates and customers, leadership skills, administrative skills such as proper emailing and organizational skill. I am now seeking a job where I can use my experience and my education to develop a career."
good,Publix will work with any one who who desires the need for more education and knowledge needed for the advnacement into management. Great enviroment to work.
good,Meeting with a lot of customers. Management and co-workers were really nice.
good,"Most days are busy which makes the day go by a lot faster, I have gained so much experience already within less than a year, I enjoy making my customers smile and it makes me feel better when customers ask for me by name. The hardest part of my job is completing all my tasks for the day because most times the store is understaffed. I love working as a team it helps me to get to know my coworkers as well as complete tasks faster and it makes checkout much faster for my customers"
good,It was busy everyday especially around the first and fiftenth.
good,A typical day at work includes hours of standing in one place and performing typical small talk to each customer. The management is pretty good at their job and are really good about pulling their share. The co-workers are really fun to be around and to work with. The hardest part of the job would be having to stand in one place for extended periods of time.
good,"Publix is fantastic with promoting customer service. They do a lot of training at all levels, though not everyone employs it."
good,"Publix is a superb workplace, with wonderful benefits and the opportunity to meet and serve wonderful customers. It is difficult to move up into management in the current environment, due only to the lack of open management positions in my area (Charleston, SC)."
good,"When I was first hired my job was simple and the management were very hard working, however as time changed so did management and my store went from the top of our district to on the lower end."
good,I worked there for 4 years and got let go for some paper work issues and was top picker and fork lift operator just sucks now that got everything fix for some reason cant even get an interview for any position. Great place though managers dont have your back when it counts though and hr is not much help for non employees.
good,"Managers are great, personality wise. They don’t give you much opportunity to grow unless you tell them you want to spend your whole life in Publix. They are great about school and schedules."
good,Overall the job entailed plenty of opportunities of growth. I blossomed into a new role because management saw the drive and work ethic I have. Management developed me into the worker I was and good asset to the team making the department help run more efficiently.
good,"Publix isn't a bad place to work. It's a good starting position for individuals with little to no experience. Management changes pretty regularly so if you don't like your manager, just wait awhile, they might change."
good,"Typical days at work included packaging groceries, learned to organize, deliver and assist, and the most enjoyable part was I always active and providing customer service."
good,"Great place to work, great benefits and pay, vacations, bonus ,great for starters, they pay very good . Just wasn’t for me anymore bc management always stick together whether your in the right."
good,They hire a lot of people so we don’t get lots of hours. I do more than one job and don’t get paid enough for it. You need a lot of patience at Publix.
good,We work at a steady speed. We kept the shelves stocked. Management is very big on cleanliness and fresh products. you learn many skills and all about the culture from time of hire.
good,"Publix was a great job overall. They teach you the basics to get your job done, fellow peers are eager and willing to help when needed. Publix works around your schedule, and can clearly help you determine if you want to move up in the company. "
good,"Working for Publix is probably better at some stores than others. In my case there seems to be a management and communication problem which creates opportunity problems, but I doubt its the same anywhere else given the reputation of the company has as a whole."
good,Good company to work for. Flexible schedule and great atmosphere. Hard to get full time with you start off as part-time but easy advancement in departments if you work hard
good,Good place to work. Giving back to the communities is a high priority with the company. Associates are encourged to grow in the corporation by promoting from within.
good,"Publix can make or break you. If you’re looking for long term and advancement, it’s the way to go if you’re patient. It can be a long time to advance and depends on the climate. Sometimes there’s people who can advance quicker than others. It can take a lot of patience to deal with customers, but if you always remember to take care of them it’s a lot easier."
good,I recommend the meat department the pay is better. There will be different managers that have authority over you (4).bussiest hours 12-3. You need to smile and look presentable and be on time
good,"As retail pharmacy continues to require more from the pharmacist with less technician help, Publix continues to do its best to provide at least a bit more help than the rest of the retail 'big box' stores."
good,"A lot of opportunity for advancement. Management is great if you don't have a family. Be prepared to work early, late, and all around the holidays. Benefits are very good for a retail career."
good,It was only a two week project through a temp agency. But the  pay and hours were decent.The ppl and bosses were nice and helpful. But the project was over and had move on to the next job.
good,Great place to work. Takes a long time to advance. I think it’s a good place for people with little to no job experience. They will place you in a department that is right for you.
good,"My whole experience at Publix was enjoyable and rewarding. When one leaves his or her comfort to go work and gets into a friendly environment where the days go by and quickly doing the tasks at hand, that can only excite you and push you to do more."
good,Wonderful job and I really recommended it to someone who wants to learn about management and customer service experience. Being a bagger is not easy but it lets you have a personal and job perspective in the customer service field.  I will always be grateful for the opportunity.
good,"Publix is a great place to work for those who want to retire in a good spot and don't have a college degree. The downsides are the late and long hours (managers expected to work 50+ hours a week at a grocery store) and while they do provide benefits they are not very good. Most managers have no idea what the best thing to do in any given moment is, but you have plenty of opportunities to get raises and private stock options. If you can stick through the pain for 30 or so years, then go for it."
good,Publix as a general company is a great place to work. However the last store I worked at cut back my hours and the management staff wasn’t the greatest. Customer Service management was fairly young and didn’t possess all the necessary skills needed to deal with people. And some of the staff had poor attitudes. There was some favoritism shown.
good,"Due to the popularity of Publix, each store often receives a considerable amount of people. The environment is fast-paced and sometimes stressful. But how good it is comes down to who you work with. Every Publix is different."
good,Challenging work environment. High demands. You will work your tail off. Becoming like a CVS or Walgreens and the tech help decreases every year and the job demands  and goals increase every year.
good,"Your typical day at Publix was pretty busy, but you always had a helping hand in the daily lunch rushes and grocery rushes. The management I was under was very wonderful and cared for the employees as much as possible. I can go to work but still enjoy my life and go to school."
good,"Very good company overall. Management favoritism is rampant.Never a set schedule,changes every week. Lack of dept. leadership. Customers are the best."
good,"Upon moving from the northeast to FL, I found myself applying and landing a job at the local grocery store. It was an easy feat for me as I have plenty of retail, grocery, and customer service experience. It was meant to be a temporary job until I found something else more suitable to my college degree and cost of living. I stayed longer than I should have for my coworkers and customers. It's a nicer vibe than up north, but in the end it's still more of a corporation than family. No reward for loyalty."
good,I like the part time job and the managers work well with me to schedule around a full time job   Publix has no full time cashier openings at this time.
good,"Positive, clean, productive place to work. Good benefits, great money, enough hours. Room for advancement and frequent raises. I'd reccomend working here."
good,It’s ok. The culture has change from when I first started. The people are turning the company into a regular company if it wasn’t for the stock It wouldn’t be as attractive
good,"when i started 25 years ago, it was a pretty awesome job. got full time,benefits.as the years went by,everything has changed.lazy co-workers. nothing was done about it. management got on them,but til this day,it's not working.went in the other day and thedept looked awful,and this was 10 in the morning."
good,"I enjoyed the job. It was challenging and was a great experience learning to use the equipment, making sandwiches, and interacting/selling to customers. The work was often stressful - especially on the weekend. I left due to a miscommunication with my manager about cutting back hours, she didn't know that I was planning to do that when school started back. Besides that, it was a pretty positive experience perfect if you can handle a fast-paced environment where adaptability is key."
good,"As a pharm tech, I work alongside other techs and under 1-2 pharmacist. We are responsible for patient profile amendment, data entry, counting and dispensing medications."
good,It’sa great place to work. Management is fantastic you get benefits after a certain amount of time. If you want part time you still get full time hours.
good,"Publix is a great place to work as they emphasize proper training, good manners and a high level of customer service.  The company rules are fair and apply to everyone."
good,"If you work hard and prove yourself, you will get ahead.  There is a strong culture here that panders to those they see as ""lifers.""  Raises are fair, and better than any other retail position I know of, however the goal of ""exceeding expectations"" is nigh unreachable."
good,"Publix isn't always focused on who the best  or fastest employee is but more or less who is the friendliest or nicest to the customers. In my honest opinion this leads to really nice full-timers (supervisors), but not always the best ones for the job. In my opinion promotions should made from more than just being overly nice because a really nice bad worker wont usually make a better  employee than a good employee that isn't as nice."
good,They do have a more balance life here. 40 hours and you go home. Abke to make a living is difficult unless you have a partner that also works. Great benefits.
good,A typical day at Publix could be pretty busy at times especially in the pharmacy because mostly everyday people come to pick up their prescriptions or medications.
good,It was either a very busy and fast paced work day or super slow with nothing really to do. The plaza I worked at was a little sketchy but there was always a police officer on campus to make us feel safer.
good,"If you have other things that you want to do outside of the worklife of Publix, make sure you can have a balance. Have a set schedule and stick to it."
good,Publix values their employees and offers lots of room for advancement. Most employees are part time but still eligible for benefits. Enjoyed working for Publix.
good,It’s a good company to work for unless you get unlucky and get held back. Great benefits that are even available to pt employees after enough time. Very friendly associates for the most part.
good,Work hard be on time for you position smile. Work as a team be able to help customers on demand customers always come first regardless of what customers first
good,"Good people. Good work environment. I liked the company, however, I've been in the food business for so long, I want to find a new line of work and change my lifestyle."
good,"Overall a good company. Hours could be better. It’s very fast paced and gets super busy. As long as follow rules and practice teamwork the day should go by quickly, but stressful at the same time."
good,"Was slow paced and not a lot going on at all, quite simple everyday and quite easy, pay matched the work but was not much work around. Even when I went into different departments."
good,"Publix offers a good place to work with affordable benefits plans and 401k options along with private stock. However, the lower ranks of retail working through Publix are underpaid and are expected to over perform in order to advance. Once you are at the management level, you are essentially coasting with the company into retirement if you so choose. A comfortable salary with great benefits. It takes an arm and a leg to get to that level and i dont recommend it for the mobile type of people of like a change of scenery."
good,The job culture/ environment is not as described in interview. Can be very stressful and departments are often short staffed. High turnover of employees and managers.
good,"Crazy busy in the Deli , you have to love the craziness to be in the deli. some customers will drive you bananas but thats fine cause with one bad customer there is a basket full of amazing ones to share the experience of shopping at publix with."
good,"Publix is a good place to work, and advance. In retail you know that the hours and the inconsistent schedules are going to be there. Pay is decent and advancement is possible."
good,"In the deli there is always something that can be done. Whether it's answering the phone, sweeping, helping customers, cleaning dishes, restocking the tea/lemonade area, or any other general cleaning, there's never a moment wasted. If you're expecting a relaxed work environment this probably isn't for you. I've been closing there for a year now and I've realized that if you want that relaxed work environment you can get it here, if you want to leave at midnight. If you want to get home by 10:30 or 11pm, you need to make every moment count."
good,"Publix was definitely a step above most other retail chains, but at the end of the day, the fast-paced day to day work of a retail pharmacist was still exhausting."
good,Fun place to work.  People nice to work with.  Extremely hard to get full time.  Been there a year and even transferred to another store with a promise of full time and still didn't receive full time.
good,For the most part Publix is a great place to work like every job it has its ups and downs but the people there are friendly and they care about customers. The honest truth is that it also can be very stressful at times especially when communication is lacking between the team
good,This company is one where you can advance. Managers help train and encourage advancement. I learned how to manage money services and employees. Benefits are available for part-time associates.
good,Great place to work depending on your location . Love the older staff that been with the company for years to gain experience in Customer service and respect.
good,"Working for Publix is ok if you don’t mind standing in one place for 7-8 as a cashier. Or you could be a bagger and take people out to there car in the the blazing hot Florida sun, then have to walk the parking lot and collects carts all while sweating  profusely"
good,MOre than a position. It was welcoming. Worked the evening shift/ cloing the store to prep for the next day. Management was fair. CoWorkers were nice and schedule was flexible.
good,"I generally enjoyed the work that I did at Publix as a Produce and Deli clerk, but my dissatisfaction came from working with lazy coworkers who were never reprimanded for their poor performance at work. Many would start arguments and drama and pull race cards to stop managers from doing much about their behavior. Great place to work. Most customers are very nice. Just hope you get a department/store with a good manager who can deal with the bad eggs."
good,I enjoyed the job because I liked to work hard and help customers. Provided esteem customer service my managers provided in my evaluation. I liked the hours the job gave me.
good,"Publix offers great job benefits including health insurance, dental and vision 401K stock option plans. As long as you are full-time you're guaranteed 40 hours a week. They are very strict with their tardiness and absence policy. Is Raul is a good company to work for as long as you don't have children or you have reliable childcare."
good,Everyday is different at work. You learn how to ignore rude customers.  This job is great for students cause you can change your availability for classes.
good,"Some management is better than others. Depends on the stopped but here, I believe that if you can find a store with good management, you will find happy employees."
good,"Team was generally good and most managers were pleasant but as always customers can be insufferable. You do get eval'd every 6 months and if you get a high score you get a 25c raise (minimum). However in intense departments (deli) you work non-stop, usually with the most minimal break time legally required, and there's often a lot of pressure to ""look good"". Mentally and physically very stressful."
good,I really do not have much to say about the company because I will put feeling inside of it. Overall it is a good company and if you want to advance you have the option to.
good,"Most jobs at Publix are pretty easy. It's only as stressful as you make it for yourself, but if you care about moving up in the company you will get stressed a lot. People in higher positions will expect the absolute utmost of 15 year-olds in the lowest job class for some reason. Management is based on time spent with the company more than actual ability to manage well, and it shows."
good,Overall Publix is good to work for. They have great benefits and really take care of the employees in the long run.  The job is very stressful in the department I worked in. There are sometimes high expectations that aren't quite realistic when you consider giving premier customer service and producing high quality products.
good,"Publix was good. Great opportunity and overall a great place to work."
good,"Worked vin the Deli department. Would go in and find out what station I was working on, fryer, sandwiches, or slicing deli meat."
good,I enjoy working and meeting new people .  The work environment is extremely fast pace and I have been able to keep up.  The downfall for me is the scheduling is very inconsistent/
good,"Pay isnt bad for retail. "
good,It’s a good place to work full time but not part time there is barely any hours for part timers. They provide everything you need to to work all you have to do is do as your told.
good,"Publix is a great company to work for but they unfortunately are not always fair when it comes to promotions and advancement. Its unfortunate but true. Even given this, people stay there for years."
good,"Selecting at publix is a very good job, as long as you can do very physical work at a fast paced and can count add and subtract well. Very strict polices."
good,"Los empleados son de distintas nacionalidades, todo es bastante organizado y limpio"
good,"While this was a good job for a few years, I often felt under-appreciated and was glad to leave. I would recommend as a first job because everyone should have to work in customer service at least once in their life, I would  not recommend as a career."
good,There are many opprotunites to grow within this company. I learned how to work with many kinds of attitudes and personalities well and without disturbing my work pace. I also found out more on how bigger companies work to appease a numerous amount of different consumers.
good,"Publix is a great company to work for though not everyone is very understanding of a work/life balance and seeing when you may need a break. The benefits, if you can qualify, are amazing."
good,"I've been with Publix in their Produce warehouse for roughly six months. I was trained well, and we can always ask for more training if we feel it is something we would benefit from."
good,Working at Publix has allowed me to balance time between professional and personal life. I have been able to learn many different skills from cashiering to working in the deli. Management is pretty efficient from what I have seen but could plan out schedules a bit better.
good,"As far as working goes, it isn’t a bad job to have. The only thing that I didn’t agree with was disciplinary actions for certain incidents within the work place"
good,Publix is a great company that is experiencing tremendous growth. There are many positions opening in our northern operating area but in Florida there are few positions available and there is quite a bit of competition for every position.
good,Fast paced environment and great working culture.  If you are young there is plenty of room for advancement.  Great management.  Stock options after  year on the job.
good,"Would still be there except for the low pay.  CIO came in and did not see value in PM until many left.  She has since left and I believe Publix has improved.  I miss the projects, people, and opportunities."
good,overall great company with good stock options. ability to move up with the company if willing to relocate. In management  a set schedule was hard to come by but the benefits were good
good,Everyday was different and It was easy to get into a routine. The chores there really helped me learn about other people and communicate with other employees
good,"typically busy."
good,"Publix is a great place to work, pay is great and the fellow employees are a lot of fun to work with, but the management is poor. There's a lot of young managers in my store that haven't quite matured enough, in my opinion, to be in management. Employees bust their tail for some of them, and nothing much to show for it. BUT I have had a handful of managers I really enjoyed working under! They're just expanding too fast and not being picky enough for new managers."
good,"come to work, do your part, go home, get paid, pay SOME bills and do it all over again the next day. people there are great but it doesnt cut it, bonuses would be nice."
good,Working here for the past 4 years has been a very good experience for me. It has given me communication skills and has opened me up to other skills I didn't know I already had. I hope to grow even more with Publix.
good,"Despite being an employee-owned company, the corporate level management seems to have adopted the typical American Business Mantra of ""do more with less,"" and has turned a very pleasant and enjoyable job experience to a tiring, exhausting, fast paced, stressful environment."
good,Great first job great job to havebif you ate a student as a part timer. If you want to dedicate your life to work and not have a family then management is a good opportunity.
good,I worked at Publix years ago.  Then it was a fun job.  I worked in the bakery.  Publix takes a lot of pride in their stores.  When I worked there it felt like a family atmosphere.
good,"Training process was very well developed and every two months "
good,"There are many different means of advancement but, it depends on the person and if they enjoy retail.you must be on time and attendance is a major thing for them."
good,"Poor management, great pay and good flexibility. I had awesome coworkers and good management but when it was time for a transfer they took forever and the new store was awful. your experience will vary store to store but it is still a good company."
good,Most positions will start you as seasonal and working in the facilities where they already have enough permanent workers means needing to look for a new job after the two months.
good,Management at my store is great. I enjoy working with everyone.  They are very flexible and will work with you. I would recommend working for Publix to friend or family.
good,It was a good job that required you to ring customers up and help them find what they need. In the morning you also vaccine and put out carpet and make sure the store is ready to open.
good,"Worked on all types of automated machinery including plastic extrusion machines, gallon ,half gallon fillers, casers, case stackers, labelers, printers, palletizers,  and depalletizers. Learned a lot about Dairy processing ."
good,Great place to make a career out of or for a first job. Plenty of room for advancement to management but also can hold people who deserve higher position back.
good,"A typical day was long, stressful, and fast paced. But the thing I loved about it was the coworkers were family and we always found ways to make each other smile. Everything was so hectic and messy most of the time. But when everyone did their job it wasn't bad."
good,This job is great for a part time job. There is good movement up the ladder if you are full time. The hours are long and hard with little to no work/life balance
good,At Public I learned how to take care of customers and how the business is run. I had amazing trainers who showed me to to work customer service.There was lack of opportunity.
good,I didnt learn much there except how to do my specific job that I had. They were stingy with their hours. The people who had worked there longer seemed to be the ones who got all the hours.
good,"A typical work day for me in publix was clock in, look on the paper in back and see what I'm doing then stock and clean the aisle till l clock out and leave. Theirs four different mangers that really helpful people you work with are friendly. The hardest part of this job was stocking and cleaning the frozen aisle. The best part of the job was listening to music when the store closed that was a major help. Publix was a great job but it was repetitive and fast paced and is a good place to work for."
good,"Every person i worked with was wonderful save 1 or 2, but it was just a job to supplement me after high school. That being said there are definitely career opportunities there, but most of the people i worked with were wither minors or retirees."
good,Publix is a great company to work for especially for young kids looking for their first job. It's not a stressful job but it teaches you responsibility and helps build character.
good,"I currently am a part-time employee and have been for the last four years. I really can not say anything bad about this Company. I work in the pharmacy so i can only Give my reviews on that. The only true downfall i see for pharmacy employees compared to the other store employees is because it is a 'NEW' venture for a grocery store to have a pharmacy i feel like the growth is very limited, But outside of this Publix takes care of the employees, i would recommend to anyone looking for a job that will allow them to grow within the company this is a great place( except the pharmacy)"
good,"I enjoy my job for the most part, just like all of them it has its days but it’s not too bad. The pay is definitely higher than your average grocery store, and that’s always a plus."
good,publix is alright but i think they need to help their employees out a little more than they do. some of us don’t get many hours scheduled when we need to make a living.
good,"yes i said it, the valrico publix sucks more then trump in office. i say that for a couple reasons, one is because of the lack of acknowledgment for the work i, or any of my lead coworkers put in.."
good,Transportation Operations provides a fun yet fast paced environment to work in.  There is a new opportunity to learn from almost every day.   Coworkers are great.
good,Working in the Deli is horrible if you are not older women. If you are not 40 or above you will likely have a hard time. If you are not full time you will consistently have your hours cut.
good,"Publix is a good place to work for those who want to start a career and work hard. They are accepting of people of all backgrounds and personalities, while being strict in work ethnics and professionalism."
good,"typical day at work is grabbing carts,"
good,"With the right manager you will soar at this company.  If you're pegged with a bad reputation from the beginning and looking to climb the ladder it's already too late.  Publix typically looks to hire from within (unless you're in some cache job) Loved this company from my start as a cashier to my journey to Corporate.  Most enjoyable part, when your team mates end up feeling like family members. (and the benefits too)"
good,"Publix is a good place to work with great benefits for those who stick around.  If you're part time, work hours are flexible.  401k and stock even for part time employees.  I work in the customer service area, and I really enjoy that part of it."
good,"Good company in any aspect, but I was part time and did not get enough hours to survive. Very pleasant environment, associates very professional and polite. Managers very respectfull."
good,You have to have the right mind set working there. They are looking for quantity as well as quality. I learned a lot about retail as well as supreme customer service.
good,Publix can be a great place to work publix likes to hire young kids just starting to build them up to stay with company you can advance quickly or not at all
good,Early morning arrival some nights and weekends people skills management skills customer service hardest part of the job was the long hours nights and weekends
good,For a company with so much potential then generally don't give second chances. The benefits are amazing but do one thing out of the ordinary and your name is mud. I would say if your age 20 or 55 it's the right employment for you.
good,"typically great. they're there when needed, works well with scheduling. they like to watch employees grow. does their job well and helps you to do yours well also."
good,"Management could be better, department managers can not effectively manage their departments and higher up than that there are two many chiefs and not enough Indians."
good,I served as a part-time cashier and later as a cashier trainer.  Was able to influence the development of proper work habits of those I trained.  Had good interaction with customers.
good,Flexible scheduling is available if you're part-time. Great benefits. Pay scale needs to be fair. Some departments lack in staff resulting in overworking the ones that are available. Management has improved; great listeners that try to work with individual needs.
good,I enjoyed my time at publix but knew it would be temporary.  O enjoyes working with others. The customers really liked me. I had several that would seek out my line.
good,"Great photography studio and great people to work with. Management is very involved and they appreciate their employees."
good,"It is important to realize that the work culture and management will vary from location-to-location, however, the service itself is consistent."
good,"A lot of responsibilities. Very very fast paced always something to do. Bakery management was great, very understanding of mental health issues and other sever personal issues affecting performance. Always willing to help and guide you through anything you need."
good,I have enjoyed my employment with publix. Love my customers through the years I have met many of friends. Enjoyed my coworkers and my manager was so caring
good,"I start opening procedures daily at 4:45.  My duties involve making sure that all fresh produce is rotated and any damaged or outdated product is pulled and scanned to be discarded.  The department is then set up with fresh produce, shelves restocked with juices, fresh flowers trimmed and placed in floral department.  Once the department is ready for opening, I am responsible for unloading and breaking down the produce truck.  Product is arranged in date order to prevent loss of produce in the cooler ""warehouse."" "
good,"Publix is a perfectly acceptable place to work if you just need a retail job for that moment in time, or if you don't intend on achieving any sort of educational degrees. They have no real value in hiring or promotions, as Publix feels it can train anyone who has a good attitude to perform their job. If you are reliable, work hard, get along with others, and can provide exceptional customer service, you can get promoted up fairly fast in the right store and departments. But, you definitely would want to either prioritize that, or pursuing an education while at a lower position. You can end up with a decent salary as a department manager, but it does demand a poor work-life balance due to the scheduling needs of a retail store."
good,"Just a paycheck with deli drama, favoritism and people that get away with stuff that they SHOULD get in trouble for. Publix needs to do urinalysis tests to test for alcohol so that we don’t have to work with someone who drinks."
good,Over all a good experience. Over ten years employed with them. Benefits structure has changed radically over the last couple of years. Publix is a good company as long as your willing to work.
good,Publix is an excellent company and has wonderful employees.  Can be stressful due to young employees and this being their first job as a teenager.  It is rewarding to help make their first work experience a positive one.
good,"it is a great place to work for young adults moving up in the world, who need a part time job after school or on the weekends. they teach young adults respect, understanding a business and how to communicate with others."
good,I worked as a produce associate. Basically i was in charge of tr entire department after 5. But it was easy to handle customers are friendly and if you ever needed any help other managers where there
good,"Publix was a great job. It was fast pace, eventful, and the employees were fun loving and energetic people. It was a competition for hours, and publix has always been a great place to work and earn your pay. As you progress through the company, your benefits become really great and worth the years of hard work"
good,A typical day at work consists of me greeting customers and bagging groceries and taking them to their car to unload. I've learned to be great with customers. The management are easy going and easy to talk to. Publix is very family oriented and has great coworkers. There is really nothing hard about my position at Publix.
good,I enjoy working at publix because its a great place to work and the opportunties are endless and the raises comes every six months we are grateful to work at a fortune 500 company
good,Enjoyed working there. It's retail and i ha e a family. I need stability and benefits. I learned a lot about cash handling and being in control. Western Union and money orders were performed daily. It was just some nights were very late.
good,"I started working at Publix after moving back home from college. My sister currently worked there for a little over 2 years and I was hired at the same location. I started out and ended as a Front Service Clerk. This position is a basic entry position and is a part-time position. Average pay was about $8.00/hr. A typical day at work includes retrieving shopping carts, carrying out customers groceries and loading them into their vehicles, and performing janitorial duties such as cleaning restrooms, mopping, sweeping, and waxing floors and other tasks. I enjoyed my experience while working at Publix. When I decided to join the military, Publix allowed me to maintain my employment with the company for 4 years and I was allowed to return if I decided the military was not for me."
good,I highly enjoyed the atmosphere and enjoyed being a team leader.Im very friendly and have a great Attitude.Other crew members where always there to lend a helping hand.I got to learn and rotate many different positions.
good,Select orders for stores that a headset you wear tells how many to get and where to get it from. Hardest part was working in the freezer.Best thing benefits.
good,"The company has great culture, and it reflects in their customer service. Moving up in to management was on your ability, and performance of your position. Most managers that I worked for were fair and based on your job performance that is how you were promoted to a higher position."
good,"Publix is a great company. It was just not the right company for me to work for. I experienced some health challenges while working there, and I was put on disability leave. Due to their policy, if you are not released by your doctor to return to work, you have to leave the company."
good,"A great place to work. Publix will give you the tools that you need to be successful. Take every chance you get to learn something new.  I never imagined that I could make beautiful wedding cakes, but now I do!"
good,"Good company to work for. Salary could be improved. "
good,"if you are full time this company gives great benefits, and stock options to all who work for a year!  Great for students and retired as well.  Flexible hours and cross training for other departments."
good,"It really is a ""pleasure"" to work here. There are great opportunities for those who are willing to put in the time and effort. however, the further the ladder you climb, the worse the work-life schedule becomes. Otherwise, its a great environment."
good,"Publix is a great place to work if you are a full time employee or are in high-school and can only work on the weekends. I am a full time college student and I have given Publix more than 24 hours of weekly availability, yet I am lucky to get one or two 3 hour shifts per week. Publix has a problem with over hiring, and when they do so they do not have enough hours for the full time employees. To compensate for this they cut the part time employee hours and give them to the full time employees. Also if you show interest in applying for the tuition reimbursement they will cut your hours so you don't meet the minimum required hours to get it."
good,"It is a fast-paced, high energy, team and customer oriented environment. Pride in providing premier customer service and quality products to customers."
good,"i tend to grow facial hair very fast so having to shave everyday or every night can tend to be painful because putting a blade to your face isnt the most comfortable thing to do. i believe that you shouldnt have to shave if you are not working with food. If you are a boy with very long hair, they will not allow males to grow their hair out longer than pass your ear. Also the benefits are only good if you stay with them for a long time. Publix offer NO DISCOUNTS. but other than that Publix was excellent and very flexible with hours. Publix has great managers and this company also gave me a chance to develop new skills i can use for the future."
good,"This is one place that the Customer is ALWAYS right, even when they are completely wrong.  They do bend over backwards for the customer to make them feel like #1."
good,"Advancement opportunities "
good,"The job itself was a decent one, considering I started before entering high school it was certainly the best option available. That said, the policy of moving problem managers into stores that were doing well meant by a combination of bad luck and the well done nature of the store I worked at we often were punished by having rather lackluster managers, who due to internal company policy could not be let go without a very solid reason. Since almost every manager for a new store must be a transfer, once a store is considered stable, it becomes the place the problem managers go, and led to some serious problems. In terms of the work itself, it is generally straightforward and modestly rewarding, with a solid pay scale and clear regulations for pay raises. A typical day in my role was greeting customers, bagging items, retrieving carts and a few cases of helping find stock or helping infirm customers shop, with each of those roles all falling under the purview of myself and several others at a time so all were done at once."
good,"when you start your day we look at the schedule to see if  your  cashiering or bagging sometimes there a cleaning shift, then help customers look for items or help them out to the car. managers will pull u aside if something is not done correctly"
good,Publix is a great place to work especially if you plan to move up in the company although I was not getting paid much I was only part-time and had to quit because I moved out of state. Publix is a great place for opportunity and has great benefits as well. With this being said they could there part-timers more.
good,"It can be a great job, or it can be terrible. More often than not, you’ll see the wrong people get promoted, which results in abysmal leadership from management. However, the pay is at the high end of competitive with added stock options as well. Full time workers usually get hour lunch breaks."
good,Excellent for entry positions. Management equity depends on location predominately. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management's stress and conduct.
good,"Nice people to work with, scheduled availability for hours, Publix employees off Christmas, Easter and Thanksgiving. Constant change in managers as they continue to promote from within"
good,My typical day was working the cash register.  The job involved helping customers and up-selling at check out.  In addition I would be responsible for clean up.  The hours were not enough. That's why I left.
good,"Publix is a great place to work. The environment is relaxed but the rules are set. The scheduling is flexible and their have great benefits."
good,"Publix is a good company if you want to advance in your career. When you are a manager the work/life balance is not so great. many obligatory night and weekend shifts. They do have great benefits including profit sharing and 401k. there is room for advancement; however, politics play a huge roll on advancement."
good,"Benefits are great, hours can be difficult, management can be lazy, positions are repetitive. Closed on major holidays and good pay for the work. Job can be hard on your body. You are on hard floors for extended periods of time."
good,"Great place to work, but very difficult to advance unless you have a management associate championing your request to advance.  If you want an easy work/life balance, most jobs here will guarantee that.  But you have to wait your turn for advancement.  Work experience is valued more highly than skills or education."
good,"Any job can be either a great place to work or a terrible place to work depending on your coworkers. Managers tend to have a ""I put my time in"" attitude and tend to slack off even if the department is sinking. This does not reflect all management just some of the managers I've dealt with in my 7 years of service."
good,"It was a good high school/college job for me. worked with my school schedule. fun people, good customer service. Pay was better than other part-time jobs."
good,"Publix is a nice place to work, however, it is not a place I can see myself working in for a long period of time. It is a very busy place to  be, not only as a Publix associate, but as a Publix customer, too. This especially applies to the store I currently work at. There, business is constant and all associates present work their hardest. For me, the opportunity to work with some very spectacular individuals is rewarding, and is something I value, but it is the customers that can be a little grueling. That goes for all customer service/retail jobs, I am aware, but at Publix, where the effort for associates to be neighborly and overly helpful with customers is made evident, the kindness is often taken advantage of by customers."
good,"i have been with publix for 6 years now, and yes it is hard work but it is worth it. I know plenty of people who have been with publix for many years and have moved up in the company and made a great life for themselves"
good,"A typical day is filled with the following activities: bag groceries, help people to their auto, keep lot free of excess carts,"
good,"The Publix Deli is the place where you could never be bored because you are either assisting customers or prepping or cleaning other areas of the department.  "
good,The job requires mulit-tasking and customer service skills.  It is stressful to take customer complaints and return certain merchandise that seems like a scam.
good,"Publix's culture is one to be admired for the least. It has a standard that definitely competes with other stores of the same category. Quality is always its priority and it is made sure it is met. For bakery, it is a very hard working section and top work ethic is needed to be a reliable member of the team."
good,This is a great job for high school college aged kids getting started out. Met a lot of friends and learned a lot from various people. Opportunity for advancement if that's what one wanted to do.
good,"its a good job, you should apply. You get to eat for free. You would think they would also make the vending machines free as well...but yeah, you should apply."
good,"I have spent 3 years at Publix. Time and time again I ask to be advanced to a full-time position. I stayed after my scheduled shift, worked twice as hard as others in my position, and have been promised the position on multiple occasions. No luck. "
good,"Great place to start a career, though you get caught between moving up and leaving.  Once a full time you have great opportunities if you are young.  Always ask and push for advancement.  They won't hand you a better job."
good,"The upper-level management was great.  Lower level management was so-so.  A lot of advancements seemed to be based on experience, not overall skill, with several more well deserving people being passed over for seniority.  The co-workers were competitive, very self-based atmosphere."
good,"this a definitely a company you can grow in, its very fast past and growing more in customers daily. work environment depends on the store but every where in south florida is typical busy. the staff will definitely make or break your experience. thankfully, mine was pretty good. my patients appreciated my staff and myself, customer service is key working anywhere but especially in a retail setting where your patients also grocery shop which overall helps the company."
good,"Management sucks, feels as if you can not move up sometimes . Always has a rotating schedule unless you work for corporate, you eat for free which is cool."
good,Got to be good with people. Its fast pace. Good on the body. Great working environment. It could get busy sometimes.got to be able to work on team. Communication is the main skill.
good,"My publix I worked at was right across the street from my neighborhood, so travel was a plus. Management can be helpful but also very poor at times since they transfer management when they move up in the company to new locations."
good,"I loved working for publix, the staff was amazing like a huge family and the culture made you feel like you were doing a great service with your job. The only issue I had was with one of the managers that made the job like a huge chore as he stressed out over the smallest things. I would say that the majority of the managers were amazing though, i wouldn't write off applying for publix as its a wonderful company to move up in."
good,"For the most part, my coworkers are fun to work with. The management varies from each store. In my store, the management has decreased tremendously. The customers can vary from annoying to very nice. It is really a hit or miss with the customer."
good,"I worked for this company just over 10 years. I have worked in two different departments and worked my way up in one of them.  I have seen excellent managers and terrible managers. My biggest complaint and reason for leaving the company is people becoming managers who do not live up the duties of manger and do not follow the idea of the Publix environment.   I ended up doing my job duties, picking up slack from the other (full time) employee when they worked, and doing more than a part time two day employee should have had to do.  I am in school and this is why I worked less days.   I became an issue if an added job was not done or if the daily tasks were not finished.  I had only 8 hours a day t do two days work of work every time I worked.  My other associate and myself would address this to management but because the latest manager there did not want to work harder than they thought they should, they shrugged it off and got attitude while we were expressing our need for help.  As a manager of a department you are expected to help out in all aspects in the department while also doing your assigned duties. In my opinion, great management makes or breaks the work environment.  Unfortunately, there were too many bad eggs moving up than good.  This has been more of a trend within the later years, along with other negatives I saw as the president became the new CEO."
good,"A typical day as a front service clerk. It's easy, you bag for customers help them to the car. You also pick up carts throughout the parking lot and store. I liked the culture there it was a fast paced environment that kept me on my toes."
good,Good place to work.People there are friendly as well as management . The work its self keeps me busy and never really too hard. My favorite thing about the job was knowing my customers and what they wanted before they said anything .
good,"Loved the benefits this company hands out to their full time employees, the pay rate is well, and the hours are flexible and steady. Having an hour break was always nice. The management was great! Very friendly environment! If there was a publix in Maine, I'd sure be employed there."
good,Fast paced.VERY high standards which make for a quality work environment. There is a large  bench of associates trying for managment which makes it difficult to get there
good,"I enjoyed my time at Publix very much. All associates and managers are always willing to help and provide excellent customer service. A typical day would include loading up products from the back room and stocking the shelves on the sales floor, disposing of cardboard in a baler. A Publix stock clerk needs to keep an organized, clean and safe work area in the back room as well as the sales floor. Hardest part of the job was only lifting heavy things. It wasn't very hard as it was exhausting at times. Other than that it was a good job to learn time management and working with a team as well as working individually."
good,"just like any job mangers can be good or bad, luckily i had good mangers that gave me as many hours i wanted and gave me flexible hours, i mostly worked overnight and mornings"
good,"If you wish to advance through the company, it will take a long time without a college degree. Wasn't paid enough, and not enough hours. Some days you work 10 hours, some days you work 5. Very inconsistent."
good,"Publix is a great place to work with many benefits. If you can keep a positive attitude, and preform your duties with a smile, quickly and efficiently you can easily get a decent raise, and potentially move up."
good,"Earning a sustainable income at Publix you must be in a management position.  Promoting managers select people based on your likability and not what you can do and skills.  They do require all personal to take tests to evaluate your knowledge but you still have to have the backing of the Store managers and District managers. This company still has one of the best benefit programs available, but has reduced their labor cost through extreme evaluation programs.  In other words they may start you out with good pay, but pay raises and increases are difficult to come by."
good,I love publix. But the direction they are taking their management is questionable. Too many times over have I watched good people get passed over to favoritism. As far as the company goes they do take care of the associates financially but dont have medical issues as you age in life because there is no understanding or empathy at all.
good,"Publix help me a lot with building a communication with customers and associates, perform an excellent working task and completing job assignments and making sure that the job duties are finished properly."
good,"I made some good friends there and I learned a lot of skills that help to make a customer's day go by smoothly. On top of that, I also make small connections with some of those customers each day I'm there."
good,"If you plan to pursue a full time career early with a company at the age of around 16, then it is a good place to work, but if you go in above the age of like 18 and have plans to go a do bigger things then it doesn't present much opportunity or benefit."
good,"I enjoy working at Publix, it is a great company.  I however feel that the younger you are when you start there and the longer you are there, the more opportunity or chance you have of moving up the management ladder."
good,My direct manager was amazing and a excellent teacher. Other employees in the department just were not very welcoming. They don't seem to really care about the individual or the department managers.
good,"As with all retail pharmacies, there are extremely high, perhaps unrealistically high, expectations for staff. Immunizations, health screenings, MTMs, performance metrics, and a seemingly ever-shrinking allowance for technician help are the most difficult part of this job."
good,Fast paced environment with many opportunities for career growth if you're willing to relocate and perpetuate the Publix Culture to new associates throughout 7 southern states.
good,"Publix is a decent company with comprehensive benefits for Part-Time and Full-Time workers, though the experience sours a bit with poor management. The workers are motivated and friendly, as are most of the customers."
good,"Was relatively straightforward and as long as we had a large enough staff we were typically able to handle the work load without any issues. Deliveries would come in the mornings and if I was working the morning shift we would break down the pallets and our manager or team leader would break us off to cover restocking and leveling off our aisles either individually or sometimes in small groups. Nightshifts were more concerned with preparing the store for the following down, doing counts of items, and fixing up the aisles in a timely fashion before closing and running a last check of the aisles with the closing manager(s)."
good,"The Managers were great and understood your reasons to be off , I never had a dull moment there . The company is a safe place to work , it can be fun and busy sometimes as well. It's a clean store."
good,"Typical day is 12 plus hours, customer service, filling prescriptions, immunizations, MTM, etc."
good,Very nice people and usually face passed environment everyone trying to get work done lots of laughs. I learned to work well in groups and to be better with people.
good,Its greet if you like helping people and providing great customer service. It does not work well if you are not a people person. You have to be friendly.
good,I was in a location that hired too many employees. Its a small volume store so the hours were being dished out evenly meaning alot of people had there hours cut down. The company is great just my specific store had its issues and didn't work for my lifestyle.
good,Started this job when I needed some money while attending college. Became one of the first jobs where I learned how to save and learn how to work stock options.
good,Has competitive wages and benefits. Typically good work environment. Very fast paced. Very clean work environment. Easy advancement. Paid weekly. Offers health insurance for full timers.
good,competitive. fast paced job. My managers were personally unprofessional and ill trained. cant speak for the entire company. great pay for retail. no complaints.
good,"It was a typical work environment.  Management is fair, and work balance life is good.  I have learned a lot from my managers and coworkers.  The pay is fair, and there is always room for advancement."
good,"Great company to work for while I was attending high school and college.. I would recommend Publix for future employment by any kids going to high school, college, or Seniors... Great stock option when I left the company.."
good,The first 2 managers that I worked under was a very nice person and she trained me well. The last manager was very different and mostly care about meeting quota.
good,"Easy to advance upwards in the company and fill roles better suited for you. Friendly staff, hard working. Good pay for the job. Dress code is fairly strict. Don’t work in the Produce department- they dont earn nearly as much momey as they need to be, and its a harder job than you think."
good,"Good culture. Clean stores. Low pay, managers can be hit or miss. Most are willing to accommodate people's schedules as much as they can. Good job for high school and college students that want money on the side or retirees that need extra income or something to keep them occupied."
good,"There is a lot of pressure and the pay is very little.  If you do get promoted, things will go fine for you.  Otherwise, progression is incredibly slow and the pay is very little."
good,"At a high volume store, I worked 10 hours on average (12+ when I went to college). Good customer service training and time management for learning. Culture was very displaced between employees (demographics lead to a lot of issues). Maintaining stress was the hardest part ( put in 70+ hours in school and work in a week). The best part is the benefits"
good,Good company for those starting out. doesn't have a lot of full time positions. Those that do have them stay on a long time. Good place for a young first time job seeker.
good,"The benefits are awesome. Advancement can be quite competitive, demanding hours, crazy retail hours, some managers are difficult to work under, not conducive to a balanced life"
good,One of the better paying companies I work for. Busier stores give better bonuses. Potential raise every 6 months. If they dislike you they cut u down to minimal hours
good,"At Publix, you have a set job to do everyday. You clock in, and get to work. It's busy, which is good. My particular store had new managers who weren't great at scheduling (part of the reason I left was because I would be scheduled to work just a couple hours in the middle of the day) but the company keeps an orderly ship of well-trained employees and a professional atmosphere. Whether it's your first job or a life-long career, working at Publix is a steady job with a pleasant, professional environment."
good,The Company is very good to work for. However in the Department I worked for there was too much unnecessary drama. The benefits were fair. The stock options and the 401k had great benefits on the long run.
good,It has been 10 years since I left my job at Publix. I have heard of many changes since my time from friends still employed there. I do not think I can give an accurate review for this time period.
good,"Working at publix day to day was pretty good, I left because of not being full time and needing full time hours. Publix is a good first job in store, and the warehouse is a good place for a career. I enjoyed my time with publix and would go back"
good,"Publix is a very competitive place to work. Full time or even coming close to Full time will be a challenge. They will work with you if you need a good part-time job but other than that, it's kinda cut-throat."
good,"I was responsible for taking care of  the customers slicing meats and cheese also making sandwiches , platters , stocking our floor area, cleaning ..."
good,I worked for Publix less than two years and I was promoted to a management position. they recognize hard work! They are very safety driven and put the associates safety first.
good,"Maintained up-to-date knowledge of store policies regarding payments, returns and exchanges. Prevented store losses using awareness, attention to detail and integrity. Worked as a team member performing cashier duties, product assistance and cleaning. Guaranteed positive customer experiences and resolved customer complaints."
good,"Working at Publix has many benefits but also some very notable drawbacks. On the plus side, Publix is employee-owned and offers a host of optional benefits to their employees. Among these benefits are dental insurance, vision insurance, life insurance, a 401k plan, and stock options. It's very important to note that these perks are offered even to part-timers (the majority of the work force at retail locations). Publix also only promotes individuals from within, so you never have to worry about someone from another super market chain swooping into a management position. On the other hand, advancement can be very difficult for retail employees and salaries can stagnate quickly."
good,"Good benefits"
good,I enjoy working with the team and having the opportunity to develop and grow our team.  Publix has provided me with a great opportunity to expand the security team.  I have helped develop and grow the team from 8 members to over 35 security professionals.
good,"You either have to have connections, be close with management of your department, aka, friends with them, or work your butt off for 5 years. I did learn how to work a bailer, make bales, work a hydraulic pallet jack and loading and unloading trucks, this job allowed me to become really good in organization and stacking. I did enjoy the work  I did here for a short time but due to such a long wait for full time I had to make a decision. Hardest part of the job was not really anything but if I had to choose, it was managing my time well enough to keep the sales stocked and replenished. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning new skills."
good,Excellent starter job as well as career choice. Publix promotes from within. Stock options should be taken advantage of the company matches.  And managers are paid fairly well up to 6 figure for store managers
good,Publix is a great place to work.  Compensation and benefits are beneficial to employees.  They work with you when you have problems that need to be addressed.
good,"Its a good work environment, i learned patience when dealing with customers. The workplace can get really busy, but it makes the time fly by so thats good."
good,Heavy concentration on training and preparing you for you job roles.  Multiple written and digital resources to enable you to expand or supplement you knowledge of you job tasks.
good,"Decent for someone starting off and wanting part time work experience. The unfortunate part is retail does not rest on weekends, so most likely you will be wanted during Saturday and Sunday, along with holidays unless you ask for time off. Management is decent, but can be hit or miss in my experience."
good,Its a good place to work.  the scheduling is a little unpredictable but you can work with your manager on it.  The benefits are great.  The employees are always great to work with.
good,"Fast pace work atmosphere,fun,very productive and laid back. The most important part about the job is that you interact with people everyday and making their shopping experience happy and exciting"
good,I enjoyed interacting with the public and my coworkers. It  was a fun place to work. I enjoyed getting to know the different people and seeing the diversity of the customers.
good,Great job with opportunities for advancement. Love working with people and assisting them. A day at work feels good to accomplish. I'm always learning things. Most enjoyable part of job is feeling confident to have a job with caring people to work with and good customers. Hardest part of job is dealing with people who complain too much. I like my job and don't like constant complainers. I'm always happy to do anything at all I can.
good,"Great retail environment that focuses greatly on the customer and empowering associates to do whatever they can to ensure customer satisfaction. "
good,"It is a great company to work for, but as a manager it is awful. Don't do it. Don't get sucked in by the money. The benefits are great, and the pay is good too."
good,"Publix is a great place to work. There is always room for advancement and everybody is family. The management is great, everyone shows one another the respect that they deserve."
good,"Learned how to keep track of inventory/stocking and sales to ensure the store had sufficient  products. Workplace is energetic and most of the teams are good natured. The challenge, at times, was helping a customer, who already approached me upset about something that was out of my hands to help with. Luckily the Management was always there to help but it was a sticky situation non-the-less."
good,"The company is a good place to work. The atmosphere depends on where you work, mine is pretty good. It's easy to move up but you have to have open availability."
good,Never a dull moment environment very clean and structure store. Managment is very helpful and compassionate for employees and customers. Skills the train you for can be used at work and at home.
good,A typical work day involves non-stop working. You are allowed 10-minute breaks throughout the day and an hour lunch. There are a lot of managers that care about the employees and they will help you with any questions. Working at Publix is very hands-on and requires a lot of focus and determination. It is easy to get promoted for you are given an evaluation every 3 months and eligible for a raise every 6 months.
good,Very friendly and family orientated work environment. Long hours of work every day. Working there is really a pleasure. Great pay and benefits. Employee ownership program guaranteed
good,"While working at Publix, I received a lot of benefits. The health insurance was normal however the dental wasn't really good. We also got inventory bonus which were eliminated recently."
good,"unload and stock shelves "
good,"- Help customers by bagging and assisting them with their groceries to their vehicles. Collecting shopping carts from parking lot to inside store. Assisting the Customer Service Desk As a translator, locating certain items and providing specific information of various items; location by aisle, shelves. Opening and closing procedures. Returning items to their respective place in record time."
good,"it was good, could do more full time firing from within, that was very hard to get no matter if you had the top reviews like i got. i loved customer service and Cashiering/ Helping customers and working in the Liquor store."
good,A typical day at work for me is pretty good. I learn that it is a very diverse place to work at which is great. The mangement team is good overall. To me there is really no hard part to the job. I get along with all of the customers and my fellow associates. The most enjoyable part of the job to me is being able to meet new people each and everyday.
good,Feels a lot like family. Outstanding benefits if you reach the alotted amount of hours needed. Often have cuts in hours.Not always room for advancement which is frustrating.
good,working at publix is a very great opportunity very people friendly and also the location is great place for networking.it shows you neatness and great customer service
good,"The job is not very challenging, but there was definitely room for job advancement.  The management is great, but I did not enjoy working in retail and working weekends."
good,Overall the company is a great place to work for. It has a great work life/job balance. However in some areas of the company there's a difficult time of moving up and management does not care to help you move up.
good,Publix is a very professional company with high standards. Employees are expected to work hard and go above and beyond average standards. However sometimes the micromanagement can get out of hand. Also the 10/10 rule regarding customers can be overzealous.
good,Its a great job with great benefits but they dont care about your outside life that was the only problem.I must say they award you for your hard work and make sure you know they see it
good,"Worked At All stores in the Lake,Sumter, and Orange counties doing onsite It Maintenance. The best part of the Job was getting the issues fixed were we can provide Excellent Customer Service. Learning about State codes in the Fresh Departments."
good,Great starter job. I learned how the sales business worked. Management was very fair and willing to help out when needed. The job was never really hard unless you had teens that wouldn't listen.
good,"Cashier - maintained a balanced drawer and took care of customers needs"
good,"I loaded and unloaded trucks, did receiving, rotated products from trucks, clean and organized warehouse, moved dough that was made over to cooler and stacked dough when it was made. I have always liked working In a warehouse and having a warehouse job."
good,Usually a pretty steady day and the customers are pretty nice.. Very nice co-workers. Management is nice and usually pretty organized. The hardest part is remembering all the produce codes to make for a faster check-out. and not crazy about having to ask for donations.. What I enjoy is there is no stress..
good,Grocery clerk for a year there. Worked every position in grocery to try to get promoted but got passed over for a new person that knew nothing. Very stressful and fast paced with very low pay for what they demand of you.
good,Publix is an very good job for teens they have and very good management.Good service helping out customers and good managers.It has good benefits and is good for teens.
good,"Like any employer they love to talk about how great they are. There does seem to be pretty decent upward mobility, especially in the area, but of course you need to be willing to wait. Speaking of waiting, don't expect full time immediately. they'll give you 35-39 hours a week for at least 6 months before they give you the ""full-time"" title. And you need to be full-time for about a year before you get any decent benefits."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working at Publix. My ONLY complaint would be that it is impossible to get a ""FIXED"" schedule! One day you come in at 7am, the next day you close till 11pm...and they let you know on Wednesday what you are going to work on that weekend/following week, so it is unlikely that you get to plan ahead for any fun."
good,"Although this was a fantastic place to work, it was VERY hectic, with decreasing technician hours and the job was very strenuous. Pharmacists work 12 hour days, 2-3 days in a row and were required to come in for a 4 hour overlap on Mondays after working the long weekend. It's not very conducive to family time, unfortunately."
good,"Comfortable, nurturing environment for candidates who are willing to commit to Publix for the long haul. "
good,Easy enough job to maintain and they are constantly trying to advance employees. Some products can be heavy but great teamwork to get the job done. Management differs by person but overall needs to be overhauled.
good,"Publix is a solid place to work.Wants to take care of customers and employees. "
good,"Working for Publix really helped me grow not only in my field of customer service, but as a person overall. I learned how to manage others and customers while maintaining a good attitude. I enjoy problem solving and I love helping others. I also like the book keeping aspects of it all, I'm very good at balancing all of the offices and drawers. Publix taught me how to run the most important part of the grocery industry: customer service. I learned how to motivate other associates and keep everyone on task, while keeping my front end running smoothly and effectively."
good,"All roles are easy to learn. The company is not that great with dividing hours in customer service. No consistent weekly hours. A great job for a first timer, but also a great job if you don't too caught up in work politics."
good,There are a lot of advancment opportunities. They try in any way they can to help you succeed on whatever area you are in. Sometimes they put way to much on one person and punish they person when they don't fully succeed.
good,"Great company with great benefits, questionable management. The working environment is as it should be in a popular grocery store, fast paced, but management does not have an Open Door Policy like they are supposed to have."
good,"Forklift, cherry picker, loader, stacker, dock coordinator, recycling, motor driver, selector, milk create runner, cashier, bagger, stocking, customer service"
good,learned how to operate deli equipment and became boars head certified. Over all not a bad company to work for. if there was one down in ocean springs I would ask to be transferred.
good,"The managers are fantastic.  If I want a day off, they push it through without arguing.  If I need extra hours, they call other stores to see if there are others who could use my talents."
good,Publix is a great place to work for with very flexible hours. You set your hours to exactly what you want and they give it to you. The only problem I have is I just transferred to a new store and I'm not getting many hours. Managers are great most of the time. Not a bad place to work.
good,"A typical day at work was always being busy whether is was cleaning up around the store or helping customers."
good,I enjoy what I do because I like people and interacting with others . Being able to be a team player helps me to be able to work well with others.
good,typical day on the job means to be behind the customer service counter and help customers with western union money transfers
good,"I've been working for about 2 months . It's challenging , but there's a lot of opportunities to grow . The staff is very friendly and balancing life wise they will try there best to help you"
good,It's ok. 5am-130pm. Most of the time off early. Some late days. Too many call outs make days longer. Very strict on attendance. High turnover rate. Senoiority is overly used.
good,"I worked with Publix for three years. They work well with student schedules for the most part, but some managers won't give good hours unless you can work all the time, which isn't realistic for some people. Pay could be much better with how costly the groceries are. Managers can sometimes be unnecessarily harsh but they are helpful when you have problems. If you work in customer service however you will be blamed for mistakes and punished for them, even if they're not your fault. Overall an okay company to work part time at if you're a student looking for some extra money."
good,"This job experience brightened my social skills and engage in clear conversation, the work enviroment was upbeat and organized."
good,Management will work with you and time off is based on the online system. The store is always busy and there is always something to do. Training goes through your job then you have in person training. There is continuous training throughout the year for you to improve.
good,"I enjoyed my time there, I just didn't like the way the management handle certain situations when it came to customers. The workers were all very kind it was much like a family community."
good,Easy job. Typical grocery store work. Decent pay for the work you do. Very routine daily tasks. The management can be difficult at times. Most managers do not help you serve customers unless you get a good manager.
good,"As a cashier a typical day was more or less standing at the check stand and ringing up groceries. They do provide a bag clerk, which is very helpful and gives you someone to talk too. "
good,"I loved the people I worked with and I absolutely loved my job there. But when it came to the higher ups and the actual meat of the company, it fell flat. The immediate store managers were for the most part pretty alright but dealing with the company itself is a nightmare."
good,"Co workers were great, and Management for the most part was okay. Some management got away with whatever they wanted too. I was part time and they asked me what time of days I could work and they worked me whenever they wanted too. When I questioned my manager about it his response was ""at least you have a job""."
good,"publix is one of the better grocery store companies to work for, hours are long however. Very clean and safe environment."
good,"Most managers work with you on scheduling, which is convenient. Most managers understand the part time work as they promote from within. If you do your job and listen, advancement is easy."
good,Not to bad or those who love getting great benefits. Difficult for those who do not have a people person oriented attitude. Otherwise a decent place to start the workforce in.
good,When I started working at Publix my title was a bakery clerk. So I was in charge of packaging product for the floor as well as customer service. When I mastered being a clerk I wanted to learn to bake and mix and decorate. I mastered every skill in the bakery besides the management part when I decided to retire. I made some great friends with coworkers and had fun working there. Although I'm greatful for the aquired skills I learned I lost my passion for it and wanted to complete my education so I can start my career in dentistry
good,"The hardest Part of the job was dealing with some co-workers. If they didn't come to work ,a lot of the time the work would fall on others. Management varies as well. Some managers care some don't. Working in the deli was the hardest but fun as well."
good,Overall the company is fantastic to work for and advancing isn't the easiest but definitely worth the wait and work put in. The management I had at the specific location really needed work. Very petty customer service manager that got to where she was by dishonest actions.
good,"Publix is a great company to work for.  Plenty of room for advancement.  The benefits are great too.   Hours can be long, gets hard to balance home life and work life."
good,"fast past busy friendly and fun day. Most of my customer service skills, bookkeeping, managing, and team work. management need work. co-workers friendly but had our ups and downs but learned and made better. being a leader and friend. working with and helping  people."
good,"A typical day at Publix is constant customer interaction and handling money. The hardest part of the job is inconsistent scheduling, making a life outside of work difficult. The most enjoyable part is being able to interact with the customers."
good,Publix was a nice place to start my job experience. Always very busy assisting customers and maintaining products. Everyone was always willing to work together as a team.
good,"Not a bad place to start but it definitely depends on the location, managers differ and employees do as well. Easy to move up and advance to higher position but pay only changes every 6 months, not necessarily a bad thing though."
good,"working for publix is good when your younger and maybe in college they do work around schedules with school, second jobs etc. but are not willing to give full time which means no benefits."
good,Days at the job ran very smoothly with the right store manager closing. Most of the Co-workers work better with a good team leader.
good,you can get many hours working here as long as your the best. or everyone else is lazy. usually one or the other. payment is mediocre at the beginning and they will find reasons not to give you a raise until your well past your year mark usually.
good,"i love my job its a great place to work a your first job. its even a good place to make a career out of , alot of my family works thru publix and they are managers . i have learned alot because of publix . im very thankful for my job ."
good,Great starting place for work. Very flexible schedules and there is room for advancement if it is something you are passionate about. They offer great benefits and pay raises.
good,It's a good job during college. If you get a degree you can do a lot better. Without a degree this is a good bet to move up and be a manager.
good,"I love the opportunity to learn new things, and to train associates on a day to day basis.  I have learned to prioritize, schedule, and hold my associates accountable for their actions.  I am business minded and I believe my job comes first.  The hardest part of my job is not being recognized for the work that I do."
good,"Working at Publix was a great way to get up close and personal with the guests you're striving to provide excellent products to. I spent many hours packing out fresh food that would mostly get sold within the same day and was mostly in charge of closing down the bakery and making sure only the freshest food stayed on the shelves with our conservative Best By dates and organizing the food going out to make sure it got donated to a local food bank. That, in my opinion, was one of the most enjoyable things about my job, just knowing that our company minimized waste while providing food for the less fortunate on a daily basis."
good,Picking and shipping and receiving. Good place to work. Good pay and benefits. Organization in the 2nd shift could be a little better.
good,"Alot of work. Good place to work while in school or college. "
good,"Management is always willing to help and overall just friendly. I enjoy working for the company, though I don't get many hours as I would like, I'm always looking for more opportunities to get them."
good,"The environment is laid back. This a good company to work for from an aspect of benefits. There's potential to move up as a leader. Just like any job, it could be the easiest or hardest depending on the managers."
good,I go into work am assigned either a till to attend or help bag grocery items immediately getting right into the mode of customer service. In being in a grocery store theres always someone to help and assist whether an item to find or their car to get to. And that typically is my whole shift other than different people and different conversations.
good,"A typical day at work would involve bagging orders, helping customers to their car, and retrieving carts from the lot. Publix stresses the importance of customer service and taught the best ways to give it. Management is strict but fair, and co-workers are reliable. The hardest part about the job is working in the heat when retrieving carts, and the most enjoyable part are the one-on-one interactions with customers."
good,"Fast paced, restaurant style business minded"
good,"straightened up shelves,clean shelves, help out the customers, occasionally we help out customer service with price checks, clean up spills immediately"
good,"Publix cares about it's employees and does what they can to see them strive, but, if you work in customer service hours are not guaranteed or stable. You could have a 33 hour work week this week, and then 10 hours the next week. Too unstable. Other than that, I've made great relationships with the people I work with, management included, and with the customers."
good,"A day at Publix consisted on coming to work and heading to back to get a cart of whatever needed to be shelved. The hours were long but the work was usually consistent, unless we had a rush of people.  The work was always more than what could be completed in a day and what was leftover was given to the following shift, on top of their own work.  "
good,"Depending on what you're doing, you job difficulty waivers like any other place. Customer do take advantage of the catering you have to do making some days stressful than other."
good,"The company overall is a good company to work for. The benefits and stock purchase plans far outweigh it's competition. However; if you want a home life or time with your loved ones, do not ever go into management. They tend to completely assimilate you and even on your days off will call nearly non stop for answers or help or miscellaneous items."
good,"Very busy, hardest part of the job is the patients who can be very mean and rude. My coworkers are awesome, I wouldn't trade them for the world."
good,"A typical day is non-stop from beginning to end.  There was always something to do pertaining to inventory but some days were more easier than others.  "
good,"Publix is a good company to work for with great benefits once full time. Working as a Deli-Clerk in a busy store can be hectic at times, but manageable. Management is generally helpful and wants you to succeed."
good,Management was awful. I got no training when i started and had to learn everything on my own. Good place to make friends. good place if you want a part time job
good,"Working at Publix offered me the opportunity to greet customers and get to know them as most shopped in our store several times a week.  That was the most enjoyable part of my job. A typical day for me was opening the store at 7:00am and greeting customers as they walked into the store, helping them locate products as needed. Another favorite part of my job was assisting the elderly when they shopped on senior citizens day.  The most difficult part of my job I will admit was working till 12:00am or later at times."
good,"I loved my job, but was unable to obtain full time position.  The advancement opportunities are not the greatest part of the job."
good,The have a good program and some good employees that make it a good place to work. there are some managers that have an ego problem.
good,"This job was held quite some time ago, and although it was good at the time for me, I dont think that it was a good career  job to hold for my personality."
good,"Publix is a great place to work if you believe in being the tortoise in a race. You have the opportunity to succeed and move onto management, but it takes quite a long time, nothing comes quickly."
good,"After working at Publix for almost five years, I would say it has been a good learning experience. I would recommend it as a good first job."
good,"Well having a learning disability is a challenge going to work"
good,"From bagger to stockman the job was going well.learned alot on team work. Management were nice to everybody and coworkers all got along,The hardest part of the job was the holidays but it was also the enjoyable part,"
good,"Good hard work, steady environment for learning the quality of product. Co-workers were easy to get along with and the management was on point most times. It was a nice place to work and I wouldt mind being employed there again."
good,I liked working at Publix. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who was looking for full time employment. The environment was really nice. Great opportunity to network with other companies.
good,"Taking care of customers."
good,"Overall it has been a fun and experiencing job to work at. You do have some managers that are supportive. You do have room to grow with in the job, but it just takes along time to move up to a manager position. the most enjoyable part of my was helping the customers find what they needed."
good,"helping customers with all the needs, making sure before the client leaves he or she had a great experience at my store. Unfortunately they rather have par time people   not to give fulltime to the hard working people like me."
good,"A very good job, but not to many advancement opportunities. Good people to work with. Free lunch everyday. Great place to work for."
good,"I enjoy working here because there is a variety of people, both employees and customers. Of course there are those people who are difficult to get along with but for the most part everyone is easy to work with."
good,a typical day at publix is usually based around customer service and making sure you keep your area clean and organized.
good,"Publix has an excellent track record for customer service and they do strive to provide premier customer service in every transaction. Often, associates are on a first-name basis with many of each neighborhood's customers, but there are exceptions, as stated below."
good,great place to work they have great benefits treat there employees with respect and the pay is decent but could be better the management is great they treat everyone with equal respect
good,"Worked with over 70 employees a shift. Lots of heavy motorized equipment working along each other, pallet jacks and forklifts. Management very approachable and tried to work with each and every employee. Hardest part of the job is summer time and being inside the warehouse. Most enjoyable is the free lunch!"
good,publix would be a lot better if the didnt switch its managers around so much. they promote from within but they transfer you away for your home store
good,"Its not bad, just have to be very patient with customers and focused on what you have to do. Always finish what you start, because there is a lot of multi-tasking.  Also, be very specific when taking cake orders. Always clean when closing, and take pride when packaging items (know the amount, and place labels on them items correctly)."
good,This job is really easy to do in any department. Everyone is pretty much friendly there but management is kinda uptight.
good,Publix taught me what it means to work.  I learned how to implement unique and superior customer service during my time at Publix.  The company is a great place to work if you are looking for a career.
good,"Publix is a good company to work for, it is organized and gives a lot of benefits to their employees that stick around. Management can change in different departments and some can see the differences be it good or bad. Customer service deals with phone calls, customer complaints and returns. Stocking is organizing, heavy lifting, and customer service."
good,"Pros: Good benefits in general (health ins, 401K, sick pay, vacation time, stock purchase plan, etc) flexible schedule, mostly friendly atmosphere, room to grow if you play your card right."
good,Publix was a wonderful job while employed there. The only reason I left this job was due to advancement; since Publix is so great with its employees no one ever leaves unless it is to retire.
good,"As a department manager, my tasks would include inventory management, customer satisfaction, Profits and loss reports, accounting reports, maintain food safety guidelines, the training and development of associates, scheduling of associates, associate reviews and evaluations."
good,"Overall, great company to work for especially when you have to go to school. As far as for the salary, this is not a place to have a nice salary."
good,Great company. Required to do more things than just pharmacy. Not crazy about that. Hours are good. People I work with are great.
good,"I enjoy interacting with customers and my co workers so that's the best part about working with Publix. However, it seems like I can never enjoy a day off without being called in which is okay if done occasionally. My store isn't understaffed but we do receive a lot of call ins. We have two very good managers in customer service and the others do the minimum of what is required to be a good leader to us. I have been working customer service/cashier jobs since I was 14 years old but I still learn more about my position with every year that goes by."
good,"Publix is a great company over-all. They don't back a lot of the promises they make. Advancement, Profit sharing, Bonuses, "
good,"Responsible for supplier management of capital equipment suppliers and category management of capital equipment.  Facilitating Category Reviews or other strategic cross-functional project teams.  Participating on special project teams, steering teams, program teams, strategic initiatives or managing suppliers for other Facilities business areas.

Also responsible for attending industry trade shows to enhance category knowledge and pursuing professional development, purchasing certifications or continuing education to enhance procurement skills."
good,"It's a great company to work for, I just need more money. I do not believe they always recognize the potential in all of the associates. The people are great and it is the place to be if you can wait to advance."
good,"I make sure that my department is running right, I make sure my associates stay on task with their production, I do counts, and inventory of my department, I write schedules, I have classes I have to take. I train my associates on their job. I help make food and platters. the hardest part of my job is when we have a very busy day and I don't have enough time to finish my manager things. I love meeting new customers and helping them with their party needs and everyday needs. I am a customer service first and a manager 2nd."
good,"clock in and unload the trucks. then I began to stock shelves and assist customers. After stocking shelves, i then begin to order my  isles."
good,"I handled money on a daily basis, I greeted customers and asked about there day or asked if they needed assistance with anything. I always had a smile and was always in a good mood. I handled problems before they got bad. I've done inventory and stocked. I've learned that customers are always the most imported in my job. The most enjoyable part of the day was seeing customers leave happy with everything they need. The hardest thing about the job was lifting heavy boxes."
good,"I have been with Publix for 9 years, and it has been a great experience. It has helped me become who I am today. A lot of great people work there, and I loved a lot of my time here. However, when it comes to advancement in the company I have gone through a lot of different hoops to no avail. After 9 years I would expect to at least be a full time associate, however, this is not the case."
good,"Publix is a good company to work for,they don't advance to full time for maybe years,50% of my time is spent running a cash register,Bagging,the other is spent cooking for what they call Apron's Simple Meals,,That is my favorite part of the job.,.."
good,"I was a customer service assistant whose primary tasks were to bag groceries, retrieve carts from the lot, and assist customers with any questions  as well as carrying out their groceries. I also would keep the store tidy and help customers locate a product if they could not find it. The biggest things I learned while working at Publix were time management and the importance of quality customer service. The hardest part of the job was during the evening when many people got off work and the store would get very busy. The most enjoyable part was when I had the opportunity to help a customer have a better experience at Publix."
good,"I learned a variety of skills involved in providing products to consumers in a grocery setting. "
good,"Working for Publix was a great experience.  I got to work with people from various backgrounds and walks of life, and the management was great!  I would work there again if I ever had the chance."

good,"Greeted local shoppers, provided excellent customer service skills.  Managed returns, cash drawer, phone calls, coupons, lottery machine, and complaints."
good,"Great starter job for those in school or in between jobs. Management can be nice for the most part, but sometimes over hire, which means you wont have many hours some weeks during peak hiring times."
good,a typical day at work would be slow but productive.costumers are very cool and polite.you end up building some relationship with some customers
good,"A typical day of work consisted of directing customers to the fastest check out line, ensuring associates kept the parking lot free of groceries carts and trash, as well as keep the restroom and breakroom clean and odor free, enforcing customer service and company policies. I enjoyed wroking with my coworkers, maturity wasnt all there but a fun group they were. The hardest part of my job was maintainting a friendly and professional environment amongst coworkers. The most enjoyable part was knowing that the service I provided could/would positively impact someone's day."
good,"I enjoyed Working for Publix. I was a Great place to work. I have learn how to drive a lot of industrial equipment. Forklifts, Stand ups, Cherry pickers, pallet jack just to name a few. my Co workers were the best they helped out if you needed help. They Motivate to you and made you strive to do better. Management was not to fair."
good,Publix is a good job to have however if one only works part time then it is hard to acquire the great benefits that publix has to offer. The associates are friendly and in return for their great customer service skills the customers continue to shop at the stores.

good,"A typical day at work consisted of a lot of computer work; spreadsheets; working with 'customers' both inside and outside of the office"
good,This was a great Co. to work with.  They basically made me the go to person.  That's why I did so many positions
good,Great place to work. Free lunch and lots of overtime. But the job is production based and its very hard on your body.
good,Publix was a great work place. I enjoyed my job there but the manager of my specific store was an issue for me. I felt I was used to work in place of others and the compensation wasn't equal to the work I put out.
good,"you learn something new everyday, friendly work place. the hardest part about my job is the grumpy customers, sometimes you just cant satisfies people but that don't bring me down .. just keep a smile on and hopefully that will bring there moods up."
good,"The company is amazing. The benefits are great. Typically I instructed all new hires in Escambia County. Management is unreasonable at times, but that's probably a person-to-person basis."
good,Publix is works on being a diverse company and practices culture every day
good,stock shelves all day. kinda boring. manager doesn't really talk much. great company though in the fact they give you vaca right away and holiday and inventory bonus. Great culture in store.

good,Great place to work if you are not wanting to advance. It literally takes years get into a management role (which is the only way to make money at this company).
good,Publix is more or less what you'd expect from a supermarket. They are however very career focused it's a great place to work if you want to be in the food service industry.
good,"Work speeds vary day to day, but other than that the works is steady and repetative. Take the groceries out of the customers cart and put them on the conveyor belt, bag the groceries, reload them into the cart, take them out to the customer's car and load them up, then bring in up to 5 carts on your way back into to the store."
good,"A typical day at work includes meeting and greeting customers, listening to how there days going or whats happening in there life. Helping them find products that they are looking for and making sure there experience shopping at publix is a great one."
good,Fast-pace work environment. Multi-task skill is a must. Customers were typically friendly.
good,"Employee owned which makes it a good company. A little old on technology however."
good,"flexible with schedules"
good,Cutting fruit and wrapping and selling is a typical day for a produce clerk.
good,"A typical day at work is handling difficult calls, multi-tasking, and enjoying what you every day.  I've learned a lot about part B billing while working for Publix.  Management for the most part is pretty good and tries to give you the skills you need to complete your job and succeeded.  My co-workers stand behind and are helpful if a problem arises.  The hardest part of my job is having started the position and seeing it end.  The most enjoyable part of my job is taking a difficult call and turning it around and really helping out internal and external customers."

good,I was always encouraged to be productive everyday. I was alwyas taught a new technique to make me more proficient at my job by my managers.
good,On my first day of the job I was welcomed as not just an associate but as a valuable person. I learned that great customer service can go a long way and effect a person's day. My supervisors and co-workers are idols and they are compassionate. The hardest part of the job is keeping up in the fast pace environment. The most enjoyable part is forming relationships with customers and making sure they leave happy wanting to comeback.
good,it is good hard work stocking shelves. my boss is happy to explain just what is expected and needed of me. the benefits are good.
good,"Empresa arrojada, estabilizada no mercado, fonte de grande aprendizado."
good,Publix is a great place with a steady pay and a great room for advancement.
good,As much as I enjoyed this job as my first and it is a good company to work for I'm ready to find my career.
good,"The position is called Apron Lady, you clean your area, prepare meal to be served by you, speak to customers and inform them of the products you used to make the meals, discuss how to make and serve meals.  Give out samples.  Clean up everything and start again."
good,"Publix is a good company, with great benefits and stocks. Its a great company if you have no plans to study and become a manager. The management is different because every couple of years a new manager comes in with different rules. The hardest part of the job is sometimes there are very rude people walking in the deli, but we must act professional at all times no matter what."
good,great pay great career growth potential and most the supervisors and up really listen to associate wishes. only down side is work lif balance is next to impossible.
good,"I may decorate up to 25 cakes a day, and assist 20-35 customers by telephone or face to face. I enjoy training others and working together as a  team. My co-workers and I all get along and are a great together. The hardest part of my job is trying to get a customer to be a bit more specific as to what he/she is looking for in a design.  I enjoy the freedom I have to create various designs on cakes throughout the day."

good,"Typical day entailed, assisting customers/employees, maintaing the look of the store, cashing out customers, working the front desk, returning product to the proper place. I learned leadership. Management team was always willing to answer question of find the answers, they were friendly as well. My co-workers were friendly and great to work with.

good,"Publix was the first job I ever had the beginning to my work life. Pleasant, management, co-workers, cross cultured, and great place to work, wonderful experience."

good,"Publix is a good place to work. I always learn something new everyday. There isn't a day where the workplace is dull. Everyone is pretty nice and management helps out. Management is there to help out with their staff, like me, to ensure any new news gets around to the people in the department that I'm in."
good,"Provide excellent customer service throughout the day. Enter data print out data break down trucks and replenish the stock, detail clean at the end of the night."
good,If you're looking for an hourly job with a great community I'd recommend Publix! I don't have any experience working there full time but I worked through throughout high school and college and can say it was a great job.
good,"Great atmosphere, friendly people. The only disadvantage is the working hours. They hire too many people and leave their employees with minimal hours."
good,"I loved working at Publix. I always wanted to work for the company as I was growing up. I was a bagger first, then became a cashier a year later. I loved my immediate manager. She was one of a kind. I met a lot of people because I worked at three different Publix's in my area. I miss it sometimes."
good,"typical day at work, is very good in the mornings but crazy during the afternoon time. i learned alot from working there like hard work, how to manage your area good. my co-worker was very helpful about job relative things and outside world things as well. the hardest part of the job is coming back after lunch. the enjoyable part is working overtime."
good,"In a typical day you would do everything from straighten shelves, to cashiering, to bagging, to helping customers to their cars. I learned how to multitask many things at the same time. Balancing cash drawers, answering phones, lottery, to balancing the back office safe. The most enjoyable part of the day was greeting the customers as they came through your line."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of providing excellent customer service. Multi tasking between the front desk, working a register and from time to time getting carts."
good,Meeting new people and creating memories worth repeating was a typical day at work for me.
good,"I worked at Publix for 6 years. I had a great time there. It taught me the value of Customer Service, especially at a young age. I worked with a terrific staff that included coworkers and Managers. The only negative thing were the false promises in promotions that were made to me. I did love went I got to go above and beyond to help a customer get what they needed."
good,Management is fun coworker is nice the hardest thing bout the job is working at 3am doing stock
good,Publix is a grocery store. I had the same shift for 7 years. I would go in and cut fruit for sale along with making green salads. I would reinact with customers to insure their satisfaction on a daily basis. I would order supplys twice a week. I did the forcast for sales on a weekly basis keeping in mind not throwing away product due to overcutting. I also had daily reports to fill out along with ordering product for my job..I also had to work with other departments. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and got along well with them. I love the customers who came in and got to know them by name and knew what they wanted. The hardest part of my job was sometimes not having everything I needed to do my job on hand.
good,i learned probably the bulk of special skills at publix
good,"I learned it takes much more than the ability to scan merchandise to be a cashier. They teach you that the customer is always right, even when they're wrong. You have to be patient and stay calm and collective in all situations as best as you can. My co-workers were all very nice people. I'm sure its natural to click better with some people more than others because of personality differences. The hardest part of the job for me is being on my feet for 8+ hours straight. It can get painful at times but i make sure i don't complain about it. The most enjoyable parts of the job is making a customers day get a lot better by a nice gesture or small conversation, or vise versa."
good,"publix overall is a great place to work. the customers were the best and most of the time friendly and very patient. every day was busy some more than others.i learned a lot about food safety and well meats and cheeses from boars head. i absolutely loved working here when i first started i had great co workers and the manager was great too. until probably a year and a half after i had started they started changing managers and assistant managers every two month months the problem with changing the managers is every time we get a new one we have to change our ways that the previous one wanted to do and how to do it and it got complicated,so the employees got stressed even more and irritated and it wasn't the same place anymore. publix is a very good place to work when your not changing all your ways every single day of the week."
good,"I loved working with the customers. They are probably the best customers I have ever seen. Publix also pays really well, which is nice, the benefits on the other hand, aren't as good. Insurance is probably benefit. The Managers are really nice, but they are extremely unprofessional. Publix really cares about their employees but they care about their personal image more, just to keep in mind."
good,i loved working at publix. pay isnt great but the work atmosphere is and if full time benefits are great
good,"An average day at Publix would include assisting customers with various issues such as difficulty finding an item, inquiring about an out-of-stock product or finalizing a purchase. On day to day basis you learn how to solve a problem and help a customer though out his/her shopping experience if needed. The most enjoyable part of working in Publix would be your regular customer, as during check-outs they share some of their personal exciting moments i.e. a birth of a new grandchild, a trip to a faraway country or just simply a new job, however a few of them could be very sad. The hardest part would be standing on your feet the whole shift plus a rotating schedule that puts a strain on your body but I think it's a great place to work at especially if you are a student as you can earn some extra spending money and meet great people in your everyday routine."
good,"Overall Publix offers many benefits. Our deli on the island gets very busy and can be stressful at times. I learned many knew skills and some management duties. I also, work alone most of the time in hot foods,mainly chicken, taking and making orders in a timely matter. Unloaded many a truck and rotating product all the time. Knowlede of using and cleaning slicers, fryers, and even cases. I enjoyed my customers the most. Many of my customers were return customers.I am always willing to help my co-workers at any tasks."
good,"worked there 18 year,retired.work was fun and easy people were great"
good,"How to work the phones, ordering, draw out electrical plans and layout for consumers. Can get a little dirty working in the warehouse looking for products. Managers let you do your work unless you need some help to do something."
good,Good opportunity to get a glimps of the Industrial Engineering field. Learned process improvement skills and tools.
good,I only worked there for two years. Company is great if you can stay there past 10 years. Before hiting the 10 year mark its a struggle. Depending on your supervisor you may not be able to gain assignment to a shift.
good,Publix was a great company to work for. I got along with management very well. I am still friends with my old assistant manager. The only reason I quit was because they could not offer me full time.
good,This is a lower level job. It does not take a special person or smart person to be able to succeed. A day starts off at 0700 and we prepare the front for customers for example filling up grocery bags and is clean for customers to come in. The rest of the days is maintaing cleanliness and ensuring each customer is satisfied with there shopping experience.
good,I need a full time job that can later become a career. I'll grown up in Publix and approaching my college graduation I feel it's time to grow and find a career I see myself doing permanently.
good,"in 5 years of my service i worked for Publix, I enjoyed working with good people. Learned much about how to bake items, some cake decorating and overall how to work well with good people. I enjoyed working holiday hours with busy atmosphere. At times, I enjoyed working by myself"
good,"Publix is a great company. On the low end of the pay scale in the market place for corporate careers, but the job security, benefits, and steady company growth of the company suit many people."
good,This places is good for those who want a simple life and good benefit and ties with in a really good business. It's also a good starting job because if you're a good working and you want move up you can with little issues.
good,"Publix has excellent benefits! Medical,dental,vision, 401K, and stock options. We have regular training sessions to keep all employees up to date on changes."
good,Publix can be great for some while being other wise for others.You just have to go in with a positive mentality and just get ready to kiss some butt to get through.
good,"They say ""where shopping is a pleasure"" but working there is definitely a perfect first-time job.  They teach you how to be responsible and work with your availability to ensure you have that work-life balance.  There is ample opportunity for growth at this company and willing management that will help along the way.  You can even begin working at age 14 which super beneficial."
good,Very flexible. Just need more hours. Great place to work and grow. Management is very good works with you as needed for school. Just need more hours of work as fulltime is hard to get.
good,"A good place to work with a pleasant atmosphere, and organized roles. The hours aren't the best based on the employee overload they have at any given time. Overall a good work place"
good,Publix supermarket is a great place to work for it offers great benefits stocks however it is also hard to obtain full time hours . The company dedicates itself serving the community.
good,I advanced very quickly but thats because i also worked to the extreme and did way more than was required. My department manager at the time was amazing and took me under her wing to make me very successful.
good,Publix is a very strong company who is constantly hiring and growing their IT dept.  This means that there is a lot of opportunity.  They provide a free hot lunch which is a nice benefit.  Also the annual contribution to your retirement of Publix stock can really make your retirement grow rapidly.
good,"Publix is a great company to work for, corporate has plenty of career advancements. Publix warehouse isn't as great but if you don't mind the hours it can be a great job."
good,It is overall a great place to work with many opportunities. Very considerate of your schedule and will try to work around your schooling. Great benefits and retirement opportunities.
good,Night shift going into day shift can be as long as twelve hours or until work is done. Temperature varies in different buildings. Management changes give opportunity to advance
good,"its kind of routine in any day of work  but you will learn something new sometime  which they have a good management and very nice and clean workplace, The hardest part of the job is some associate did not do their job but it can be support by another"
good,While publix offers great employment opportunities and amazing benifits the atmosphere and management lack. They only care for how you benifit publix and will take advantage of any decent worker  whole everyone else gets away with whatever they wish.
good,Publix has been a good job for the past 3 years but I need to start moving closer to my goal of being a mechanic. I have gained amazing teamwork and customer service skills in my time here .
good,Friendly people. Clean environment. Flexible hours and you're off on most major holidays. Only knock is that there is a clear divide between part-timers and full timers.
good,"Fairly easy company to work for. I have learned a few different new skills, and increased my knowledge on a few older skills. Management can be a bit stressful sometimes. Love the atmosphere of the workplace. Hardest part of the job is never knowing what you will be doing day to day until you come into work. Most enjoyable part is meeting new people every day."
good,Good place for start working when you come from a different country. Very good coworkers and they work with your schedule.............................
good,"Its a pretty good, specially for  retail. Lots of opportunities to move up. Decent pay. Flexibility in hours; they gry to work around your schedule. Downside, nights, weekends and holidays are a given."
good,"Working at Publix for nearly a decade in total has given me a good insight into how the business runs for its typical non-management associates. While every job has its ups and downs, the average work day at Publix is enjoyable with the correct associates around you, but can be downright miserable if there is a disconnect between management and the front end associates. Every store is different and has a unique feel to it."
good,"Publix is a nice place to work it was a easy place to get use to thr people are very friendly "
good,"Well for a typical day at work it was short around 3 hours a day, I learned peoples skills and how to be good at customer service, the management was good but I only talked to some of the managers, there was different kinds of cultures from all over, the job wasn’t hard at all just a little hot outside, most enjoyable part was getting a job done and the satisfaction I get from a job well done."
good,Deli is fast-paced and has high standards. New people keep getting hired while others who already working aren't getting enough hours. Too much work for $12/hr.
good,"Publix was a great first job. Though there are career opportunities at Publix, I preferred a different type of industry. Overall, good all around job and nice people."
good,Publix is a good company and I admire that they truly put the customers' needs first.  Highly recommend for shopping or as career. They have a good compensation package and good attitudes.
good,"Starting out it was great, but you quickly realize that there’s competition if you want to move up. “Moving up” means you have to put in time and effort; you can’t call out when you want or only do shifts on your term. The pay makes a difference; every half you get a raise based on what you put in from 25 cents up to a dollar."
good,I love working for Publix. Its not serious and everyone is always nice to each other. The only problem is that I'm at the smallest Publix in our county so I don't make as much as someone at a bigger Publix. I wanted to switch but the manager convinced me to stay and help because we lost a couple of associates.
good,"Publix is a great place to work, I just dealt with bad management and poor hours. I would get 10-20 hours per week, with promise of 30-39. Every time I asked for more they said I was working my butt off and to continue but it never happened."
good,"After stretch ups, associates have to go rush looking for equipment to work, Some workers end up not getting any and this affect you production percentage when you start late."
good,"Decent job. Worked weird hours (but pretty standard for similar retail positions) and spent a lot of time doing heavy lifting. Coworkers and customers are pretty decent overall, a few crabby folks here and there but better than other places. Management very willing to work with scheduling with enough notice and lots of promotion potential for hard workers with ambition."
good,busy constantly moving but good atmosphere great coworkers one of the best places i have ever worked reasonable advancement if willing to stick with the company and put int he work
good,"I was excited to work for a company with rave reviews such as Publix. The first week didn’t disappoint and it felt promising. As the weeks went by, it all changed. The company looked too policy driven such as no facial hair and asking your manager if you could go to lunch. My manager was strict and I felt like I didn’t get the opportunities I was hoping for. The pay is the only thing worth it."
good,"The company and work environment bring me enjoyment. I like working there, the only thing I would change is having a set schedule instead of one that varies in time."
good,Check my section to make sure its ok to start working my delivery. Make sure as I am working the delivery that specials are always stocked and the section is well maintained.
good,"Fue mi primer trabajo en los estados unidos. Al igual, aprendes todos los días, excelente gerente a pesar de que es un trabajo duro hay detras un buen equipo de trabajo. lo recomiendo para todo aquel que quiera comenzar una vida laboral."
good,because they give you awesome benefits and pay. Publix really cares about their employees. They have raises every 6 months. They are very strict about overtime.
good,"Awesome benefits. Once you gain management position, you have to sacrifice important family moments,  and sometimes your health."
good,"It really is an amazing company to work for. I can't say much about the other departments, but the pharmacy had super flexible hours and amazing people. You get regular pay raises if you do well on your evaluations. If you're interested in becoming a pharmacy technician, they are behind technology-wise but they are (for the most part) super relaxed compared to other places. Highly suggest. "
good,"Wasn’t what i wanted to do with my life, after the two years it got repetitive. I’m looking for a better job that can give me new tasks and not something that feels like chores."
good,"It was great while it lasted . Baking pies , cookies , and bread was harder than I thought it would be on my first day . Somehow , I was able to hang in there for two years . My manager showed me easier ways to work on certain assignments . Everyone at the job was nice to me & I learned alot ."
good,Good company to work for. Solid benefit structure with good insurance. Can be stressful working in a customer service role. Good advancement opprtunities.
good,Great company to work for great and fun place to work. Great benefits and paid holidays. I recommend checking in on a job even if its part time. Good luck
good,Good company with advancement opportunities.  Tuition reimbursement for college students.  401k and profit sharing. No discount.  Uniform tops provided.
good,"Everyone was respectful and stayed on task. I would help customers with their items, and help them out to their vehicles If needed. I would also stock shelves and clean the store."
good,I would clock in look at the what i had to do for the day work my 6 or 7 hours on the week day 9 on Sunday I would would check customer checkout bag the groceries and talk to the customer about there day tell them to have a great day and thank you for shopping at Publix and at the end of the day i would clean up my register and that would be my day.
good,"Great opportunities to advance throughout the company, especially if you are willing to relocate."
good,It’s a great experience to work at Publix. The goal is to make every customers shopping experience a pleasure and makes them want to come back to our facilities.
good,"Working at Publix is both fun and engaging.  I enjoy working with my co-workers, and though the atmosphere is stressful during the holidays because it gets so busy, it's relaxed for the most part."
good,"Thee work was hard and at times over whelming. The relationships created with co-workers was wonderful and helped to get through the shift. The hours did tend to be long and sometimes a break wasn't possible. "
good,At times it can get really hectic but as long as you can work as a team you will enjoy working in the Deli. You will have to complete 2-3 different jobs in a shift and depending how well you work and the faster you complete your tasks correlate to how many hours you get.
good,Both the co-workers and customers were extremely friendly and the employees overall were professional. Although I have to admit advancing within the company and promotions are very long processes.
good,"Working at Publix you got to see and meet different cultures of people, attitudes, I've learned to deal with all kind I had customers to come and wait to be served bye me.I was more than lived with my customers."
good,I do like working here but they hire a lot of people and that lowers all other associate hours. Lower hours is the only problem I've had working here.
good,"It's a great place to work, and the managers are friendly and understanding. I started working at Publix when I was 17 and it's always been a great place to work some managers can be difficult but if you're patient with them you can go far in the company."
good,Publix is known for their great customer service and that awesome smile is not just a front for the customers it is a love that all the staff shared for one another.
good,"I’m glad for the experience that I recieved, however, the job conditions were poor and salary is very little. I didn’t like how the treated me, so I had to leave."
good,Publix is a place to work  great customers and great associates. I have bachelor degree in chemistry and long experience in quality control lab.I am interested to work in laboratory
good,"pretty good work place. lacks hours for part time employees. can get good managment, then again might not. youll find some co workers are stagnant and dont want to further themselves."
good,Publix has a great system of people working together to get to one main goal.....providing service and a helping hand when needed. The store spreads more throughout the community and thats what makes it such a strong center for business and friendships among community and friends.
good,"very good job security, flexible scheduling allows for whatever you need so you can have a good fall back and steady from of employment while looking for self improvement such as multiple jobs or schooling. in some cases offers tuition reimbursement, and if you fit in you can excel quickly into management which offers many great benefits for a career but can be all-consuming."
good,Ive enjoyed working at publix. there was some times where it can get frustraing however i have learned and continue to grow with the company. Sometimes it can be hard with short staffed.
good,"Great place to work for beginners or for part time work! I enjoyed the people that I worked with and would go back to work part-time eventually. The hardest part of the job was the pay - we are paid much less compared to other competitors, but we surely do a better job. Great culture, all were like family. This was a great groundwork for my future professional career."
good,"Publix was a good company to work for.  I wouldn't have left except that I had to relocate due to the illness of my father,  I had to relocate 50 miles north of any Publix locations"
good,"An overall clean company that emphasizes the importance of employee and customer satisfaction. There were plenty of opportunities to advance via workplace provided training.  However, management is  reassigned to new locations every few years and it may be difficult to re-adjusted to new supervisors."
good,"If you need a job and need to study as well, this place is the perfect place for you. It's never super stressful (at least for me) but depending on what Publix you work for and what day you work, it can be really fast paced or really.. REALLY slow. On really long days it can really drag on, doing the same thing over and over and over. I closed most of the time and, for me, that was the best part of the job for me. Closing was the best part of the job for me because it broke the monotony of just bagging groceries, scanning items, getting carts outside, etc. "
good,"I love working for Publix, but becoming a full time or manager is difficult! Your experience doesn’t count. Everyone starts at the bottom.And you have to be on a waiting list in order to be eligible to take an assessment test."
good,Each department can be great to work in for the experience. They tend to focus more on the neatness rather than the product sales of the store as far as the grocery department.
good,Public  was a great place to work. Management was pretty good and i learned a lot like how to count money back and how to operate a point of sale system. The workplace was always clean and hazard free.
good,"Publix is the quintessential company for everyone beginning their journey into the work force. The salary is decent and management is there to help. In addition to learning the basics of food production and standards, you have many opportunities to transfer to other departments. The most difficult aspect of the job is the usual chaos of the busy hours. As a personal experience of the hazards of working in the deli, you are working with many pieces of equipment that will cut and/or burn you if you make mistakes."
good,Publix is a great place to work at depending on how well you deal with stress. Being part of the deli department was stressful despite only being a part-time associate. But working as a team really made working their fun.
good,"Clock in, have a huddle with your coworkers/ supervisors, stretch together. Discuss about the day-of task workload. Get in your position area. Take a paid 15 minute break after 3 hours of work. Back in your work area. 30 minutes lunch break (paid food buffet style). Stretch again after clocking back in from lunch (optional). Get the remaining work load finish clock out when it’s all done."
good,It's a fun place to work as a first job. There is potential to switch departments if you're interested. The hours are flexible. My coworkers were willing to switch schedules when necessary.
good,"I loved working there, it was a great experience. If you like fast pace and to solve problems this place is perfect. the only down side is that if the manager dont like you then you will have a hard time"
good,Fun work environment however the pay is not enough to live off of. Great coworkers and enjoyable to be around. The hardest part was not having a full time position to have access to all employee benefits.
good,"Publix is a great job for high schoolers and college students. They allow very flexible scheduling and work around your hours (if you have a 2nd job or classes, etc.)"
good,"Publix is a very good company to work for. If you do your job well you will receive hours and good pay. For a better opportunity, you must be willing to work your way up to management"
good,Publix is a great company to work for. I’ve had some run ins with my store manager because I wanted to step down before. It is stressful but can be worth it. This was only a temporary job for me.
good,i work as a front desk clerk I and i help people putting stocks of food to their carts. I've learned how to clean publix and how to assist people if they needed help. i always carry them outside when i see disable people.
good,Overall great company. Fixed schedule and only worked 4 days a week on a rotating schedule.the start time was 330 and end time varies per day and case count
good,Everyone is like family. There hours are reasonable. The management is very good. They should give there employees a percentage off of groceries or anything in the store.
good,Typical retail grocery environment. It's quick paced work and pretty routine. You handle things department by department so i can't speak for all departments.
good,"Overall, not a bad place to work, but retail is retail. You put up with a lot of the same issues in most retail jobs (bad management, poor communication, rude customers). I was very happy with my rate of pay and my steady schedule, though not all stores will be the same. I definitely felt like there were ample incentives to keep working hard, even if it was physically demanding and emotionally draining at times. I made lifelong friends there and I don't regret working there at all."
good,"Life in the corporate office mirrors the retail environment as it's early to bed and early to rise. Most managers are in by 7:00/7:30 am at the latest, working well past 5:00/5:30 pm.  It's a Fortune 100 company operating as a startup in that you wear many hats and work extremely hard.  Doing so ensures you have excellent job security with a highly regarded retailer whom rewards their ""associates"" with part ownership of the company (stock).  This personal stake in the business incentivizes the associates to perform at their very best."
good,"Considerably one of the best first jobs. Right away you start learning valuable lessons in ""premier"" customer service and other transferable skills. Plenty of opportunities and career paths if you plan to move up; benefits are available very soon as long as you get enough hours a week (but that's the catch) you have to virtually be full time to survive the low hours after peak season and still make the minimum for the benefits. Wish I had been told that sooner. As always, some customers will be rude but for the most part Publix is a positive environment; my store's employees were very nice and helpful since the day I started. The hardest part of bagging/cashiering is the repetition. Eventually, you no longer need to put much thought into your actions and that can make it hard for a person like me to want to continue coming to work and doing the same thing everyday. But if you love routine, this job is perfect for you!"
good,Results vary from different store location. Different stores have different methods of doing things.  New management changes the methods upon their arrival.
good,"With experience, understanding and learning the most important tool when working with customers is much more then being nice and helping them out to their cars with groceries…giving them the much needed attention and providing the necessary customer service that they need. I believe in doing the job the right way and understanding the learning curve. I strongly believe in role play, teamwork, fairness and equal work. Example, one employee shouldn't constantly be cleaning the public restrooms 4 times a night over a 2 week period. Front End Service clerks (or any associate in other departments for that matter) should be treated not only fairly and evenly, respected and accepted for the person they are. If humans know the difference there, then lets separate it. Be nice, be kind, be thoughtful, know when to stop talking and be a hard worker! Ever thought of anti-fatigue mats for front end bag clerks and what about wireless scanners? 2018 will be coming to an end."
good,was a good place to work when the hours was available. meeting new customers on a daily basis was always a good day. When new products came in and the challenge of selling that product.
good,I enjoyed working at Publix but the pay did not cover my living expenses well enough and while their was room for advancement it was limited and kind of first come first serve and there were a about 2-3 associates ahead of me that were due for promotion to full time so I did not have the luxury of waiting around for a spot to open other than that I thoroughly enjoyed my work life there.
good,"I use to love working for Publix and would recommend it to everyone. However, the longer I worked there the more I started to hate it. My managers schedule me when they feel like they need me and don't take into consideration my availability. The pay, however, is good. I'm a full-time college student and make enough money to support myself."
good,The work is not easy and we are always on the go. There is never a dull moment in the Deli or the Bakery but I enjoy what I do. I learned that teamwork is the best thing in my environment and that it is very important. Getting to know the customers and seeing their faces is the highlight of my job and being able to interact with them and learn who they are as a person and their interests.
good,"Benefits very good, work atmosphere very exacting.   Job security during recession. Pay was better than most retail at that time. Clean working environment."
good,"Was a good learning experience, and had friendly coworkers. I enjoyed being able to control what days and hours I would work. This is an easy job for someone in college."
good,"premier customer service, greeting customers with enthusiasm offering immediate assistance.  Assisting customers with operations, products promotions."
good,If you show up on time clean shave stay out of trouble outside of work you have nothing to worry about. I would go back to this job if i could because great benefits the job is very easy nice people to work around and your able to move up with the right management around you.
good,"Publix treated me well or the time I was there. It was nice to always have managers around willing to hear what's going on and to fix issues with certain problems in every department. They genuinely care for their employees and want you to do your best and don't beat around the bush when things aren't done the ""Publix"" way.  After two years you're granted to Stocks with the company because Publix is self owned by the employees. Overall, great place for first job and the employees are well picked."
good,good job. busy day. all standing.  lots of heavy lifting. customers appreciate service. management is fairly consistent. policy is definite. good training.
good,"It’s good to work there but the pay rate is too low, everybody work together co-workers are really helping around and really helpful, it’s okay to work there"
good,"A great job to land whether you're a part-timer or a full-timer. with that said full-timers ,of course. get the better benefits and things like that. but as far as part-time goes, it's a great starting point."
good,I enjoyed working there and meeting new people every day. I think management was very friendly and very informative with any questions I had.I loved the training exercise  because it let you be customer and employer.Very informative.
good,I honestly love working here. There are few minutes when your trying to find something to do. The past 5 years this has been my only job and the time off I can ask for doesn’t get questions unless around a holiday. You get to laugh and have fun while being serious and paying attention to the customers. Highly recommend working for this company. Great benifits too.
good,"An average day at Publix can range from slow and laid back to tense and fast paced in a matter of minutes. I have learned that a good use of time management skills will almost always have you on top of all your tasks. Management usually does an adequate job of scheduling the right amount of help. Employees must practice superior hygiene skills and maintain a clean cut/shaven look and visible piercings are extremely prohibited. I would say the most challenging part of working at Publix is breaking down the truck deliveries early in the morning. Sometimes it can be busy and multitasking becomes a must to succeed. The most enjoyable part about Publix is my fellow coworkers, I find everyone I've ever worked with here to be pleasant and efficient. Publix does an excellent job of hiring focused and committed employees who are striving to do the best they can everyday."
good,"Being with Publix through many positions and 3 states, I worked within while companies changed and grew around us . It seems our business model isn't adapting at the pace of the other similar companies. Our CEO is the biggest culture shock this company has seen and its felt down to the PT employee level."
good,I enjoyed working for Publix.  But I had to leave because the pharmacy district manager was not looking out for the best interests of his employees.  I believe that should be part of his job.
good,"Store I was at was great! Great crew that could handle the worse thrown at them. Store bonuses rocked for our location. On hand manage got their hands dirty next to you. Only problem was that when promotion times came up, District Manager promised individuals one thing and never came around to it. Saw first hand a promotion given to another (outside company) due to District Manager not wanting to train new replacement for skipped individual. After a repeat of that to a couple of others, they decided to move to other districts. Our district lost some great team mates that way."
good,Publix for the most part was a pretty good part-time job. Really the politeness and helpfulness of the employess make it a great place to shop for groceries. It worked well for me while I was attending college.
good,"verify coupons, customer service, relaxing, managers helped at all times, happy place, are able to RTO online, able to see when your schedule comes out and see your time card how many hours worked throughout the day"
good,"I enjoyed my 4 years as a customer service staff , show that your are very interested and let your department manager and your store manager that your interested in full time that’s if your a part time and would like full time position to earn vacation hrs and more benefits to the company"
good,I love working at Publix. There's great benefits you can get once you've worked long enough. Most everyone is friendly and a joy to be around. Nice long breaks too.
good,"Publix is a good place to work, any place has there ups and down but over all I do enjoy working for Publix. I love the new challenges of working in a store compared to restaurant."
good,Publix is the best grocery store I have ever seen. The people are always nice and friendly. They have just about every item you could think of. The store is always clean and well kept.
good,"Great place to work, customers are cool and calm, co workers help whenever needed. management sometimes varies because some are good and well trained but some arent."
good,"Publix is an good company to work with since they are friendly, flexible, and care for their employees. They are flexible with the schedules for the pastime employees and will give you the opportunity to work your way up in the company."
good,Good company but has its flaws. Love being there and love the people i work with. Publix is like a family. Hard work does pay off but very hard to move up in the company.
good,"Always had a good time at publix, although even though I had worked there for 4 years, there was never an oppertunity to move to full time, even though i had the hours and reposibilities of a full time employee."
good,"This company loves itself. The down side is associates don't get discounts. They definitely work around your schedules, but if you are part time it sucks that you never know how many hours your gonna get every week."
good,"Publix is a wonderful place to work if you are looking for advancement and benefits. As far as working short-term, the hours and pay are very unforgiving."
good,"This position is mostly stocking shelves, blocking, stocking more shelves, blocking more, and helping customers in between. I liked working at Publix, just keep in mind that each location has its pros and cons."
good,"Must smile at all times, hardest part was Sunday after church, friendly and not so friendly co workers , favorite part was the nice customers and my coworkers I got to talk too when we weren't busy."
good,First time working there wasn't bad once you're there for about six months things gets stressful...I normally was getting bored doing the same thing over and over. I'm more like had to do some things very different all the time. The benefits is good I never really sign up because I didn't know how to in which that is my fault. In overall its not bad to start off just do what you've been told very strict job just do your best with great attention.
good,Most managers only focus on whoever is trying to grow with the company. The workers are very friendly. As a part-time they use most of the times to complete the full timers task.
good,"caring management, quick paced but nos stressful. opportunities to advance. little underpaid but enjoyable,"
good,Typical day can be quite busy. The company values it's associates and upholds a high standard of customer service which makes it second to none. Good benefits and advancement opportunities.
good,"Great benefits and great chances for advancement if you're willing to put in the amount of hours needed. Management works minimum of 45 hours, and department managers are 50+."
good,I loved working for Publix because of the benefits and coworkers. The only part I didn't like and the main reason why I left was the customers. The people that shopped at Publix in my area were the most stuck up rude people I have ever met. After working there for so long I have changed the way I treat the workers at grocery store.
good,Walk in. Clock in. Check in with manager on what to do. Certain days require you to unload a truck. Others you work the truck onto the shelves. You clean the back room. You block the store. Fill specials. You communicate with employees and have to be well time managed. Also physical use is high.
good,"Your department manager is the most crutial. They will be responsible for your performance reviews. Impress them, become their best friend. Between them and your store manager, it can make or break your experience. I did not care for my store manager, not helpful. Overall, not impressed but perhaps I had too high of expectations. Minimal work life balance. Expect to work weekends, some holidays and late on closing shifts, 11:00 pm and sometimes later. Keep in mind each store has its differences; however, this was my experience. Money is alright but the work is harder than you think."
good,"My experience were that of a true first job. I enjoyed my time there, but unless you have another job or you plan to move up, there is no true benefit of working there long term."
good,"There's ALWAYS more work to do. Guest flow never stops, so hours are always available. Some of the best co-workers and management around. Real culture of 'owning' your work."
good,"It has it moment when it's busy and slow day. I learn to become a Deli Clerk and know how to fry and bake chicken, slice meat properly, knowing your product and learning customer service."
good,job security and stock options and something that publix takes pride in as a company. to get into managment you have to make your name stand out and you have to suck up to managment
good,good play if you want to move up the chain fast. you get a raise every six months. the managers are nice depending on what store you are stationed in.
good,"Bakery is very fast paced and exciting. Lots of chances to move up/advance your position throughout the store. Good management is spread thin right now because they're building a ton of new stores. There's a good mix of high turnover positions (cashiers, baggers, clerks, etc) and long term non-management roles (meat cutter, baker, decorator, team leader, etc)."
good,"There has been a recent history of managers who are either not passionate about customer service or are burnt out from years of the same work. While Publix strongly believes in career growth, there are many occasions where qualified employees choose to leave the company due to lack of promotion and poor relationships with management."
good,"I worked as a meat cutter in the meat dept, I worked hard to be a meat cutter.  I would of like it more if were a guy. I probably WOULD OF GOTTEN MORE RESPECT."
good,"With the right attitude, this company can be a great place to grow. I have worked there for over 4 years as a means to get me through college, and I can say it was a wholesome experience for the most part. The management is what keeps you. As long as you have someone above you who is actively pursuing the Publix ideology, you will do just fine. I have had my fair share of bad managers though. And I haven't been entirely happy with the direction the company is headed. But overall, it's a great starting place for someone just entering the job market."
good,"Until you're full-time, you're schedule is not set in stone. You will work until the job is completely finished, which can mean 12+hours daily if not more. Technically the job is never done in a grocery store."
good,"For the most part Publix was a great place to work. Co workers communicated well with each other and management. The schedule was Monday-Friday, 6am-230pm. They also have an awesome cafeteria."
good,"Not a bad place to work, but don't think about moving up fast.  Unless you know someone.  Diffidently club atmosphere, if your in it your good, if your not then I would suggest being happy with what your doing or looking elsewhere."
good,"after working for 3 years, starting with $8 and now being $10 im just not satisfied and cant live off of that. It's a great company to jumpstart your career though definitely."
good,I loved working here. If I would have got more hours I would still be there. This company is amazing. I think that managers need help and shouldn’t have as many people hired as they did since they were giving multiple people 0 hours a week but hey.
good,"I had the opportunity to move to the Pharmacy department after only 6 months of employment in the Deli without prior experience in the field. I was trained thoroughly and was licensed after a few months of training and continuing education. There is always room in the company for upward moves into management as I watched many of my co-workers move into management and some, corporate. Publix was a great place to work and the main goal of the company is to always put the customer/patient first and treat them with superior service. I left this company only because I was progressing in my degree and did not have time to dedicate to travel (1 hour drive). However, I know that I left the company on good terms and would be rehired if I ever needed the job."
good,Great entry level job with benefits if full time and great for students too. The pay is good for the level of work and management is fair and generally understanding.
good,Overall Publix was a good place to work. I retired because the hours were awful!! The pay was fair and the benefits we're great. They had a 401 k and would give you stocks every week.
good,"I wouldn't recommend any one to work in the deli department. However, I would say that getting hired at Publix right now is really good, especially in the deli because they raised the minimum wage to $11 for part timers. Its just not fair to full timers who have been there way longer and make a 25 cent difference to do way more work than a part timer. But if you're just trying to get a job, the deli department is your best bet."
good,If you are looking for your first job this is good for you. Pay depends on experience and the hours are short. If you work overtime it’s a rarity. You have to be fast and good if you want to excel.
good,Publix was a great first job for me. It taught me how to act in a working environment and how to take direction from a superior. Every day brought along a new customer with a new story.
good,Fun place to work if you have cool coworkers and a cool manager. it is nice getting paid every week and i think publix for the most part gives there employees good raises
good,Publix is a great place to work. The problem is that management  has a lit of problems to work out. Dept. Managers were over worked and very moody.some managers just didn't  care how the their meat cases  and product looked in the case.
good,Publix is a well-developed company that follows their mission by the book. They put their customers first in every instance. Training videos are thorough and easy. Benefits are good.
good,"It can be a great career if you start out young and don't have a wife and kids at home. Advancement into management is competitive, and that's where the family friendly schedules are awarded."
good,A typical day in the deli at Publix included cutting lunch meats and making sandwiches for customers. The store manager and deli manger were both down to earth and easy to talk to.
good,"At my Albany Square Publix, the pay is great, the hours are few, the staff is amazing. As a minor, you don’t get many hours, especially when they begin to hire new people, the hours get cut short."
good,Very fast paced and can be stressful but everyone there is so friendly. Customers and coworkers. Now there are somw who you don't ever want to see but that's with any job
good,Takes a while to gain good pay . I have a family to support and lots of bills so money is a factor. Great place to work for the youth to begin working.
good,great place to start working benefits were amazing. stock is the best to invest in at publix. very fast paced and must be able to communicate clearly with customer.
good,"Working the front end service with Publix can be stressful at times, but its a good job to start out with. There's a good paycheck per week depending on the hours and the schedule can be adjusted to your needs."
good,"Great company, they are very diverse.depend on the job department how hard and busy the job gets. This company helps to educate their  employee in everyway they can."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Publix customer service. Fast-paced, strict rules which I personally think are needed. The company as a whole is very friendly and upbeat."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time at this establishment. One of the best places to work for those who prefer a dry grocery/ retail stocking position. Standards are very high, which leads to competent and capable team of employees."
good,Publix was one of the best job I had during my high school days unfortunately I was let go because my high school schedule and my work life did not blend well.
good,Great benefits for employees.I learned a lot about dairy products and teas. The schedule i a little demanding. You work a lot of holidays.You have a 6 week rotation between weekends.
good,"The typical work day is a bit rushed and sometimes behind schedule but this is more do to issues with individual employees. Overall, management is very on top of everything and keeps the day to day business in order. Hours are inconsistent but there are ways to deal with that like trading or covering shifts for coworkers. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the changing of management and how each different manager handles taking care of the store. The most enjoyable part is the general flexibility of the business and how the company is very accommodating to its employees."
good,"This job is great if you are in high school or just need some extra money. The hours are pretty flexible but since Publix has so many employees its hard to receive a full time position or any benefits, paid time, etc.."
good,"Publix has change thru the years, it was a very family oriented company, with lots of benefits, it was really a pleasure to work for Publix back then, not anymore then again that is my personal opinion."
good,I do like to work with publix.  I am drive-thru with Publix pharma. I help them with inventory. They are very supportive of me. This is my first job in the United States and they help me so much.
good,in the retail life it is all about how fast you can get the job done. Managers will keep pushing you to move faster. the culture is what keeps customers coming back.
good,"I have mixed reviews on Publix, considering the amount of benefits you can get with Publix is phenomenal, but the issue that comes up is that company is very divided. There are those that will tell you how it is and help you improve with the company and then there are those that will mislead you."
good,Publix is a good company to work for. I have no problems with Publix. I'm only posting this review because I'm not able to go to the next page without posting something.
good,"It is a great place to work, great co workers! Awesome customers!"
good,Publix has wonderful benifits. A wonderful 401k program. Stocks are all employee owned. If you play your cards right and stick with it even a cashier can retire well off. That being said. . . It is not for the faint of heart. Fast paced is an understament. Lifting required at least 50lbs. And be ready to do your job plus some. The upper management is very involved and will nit pick everything that goes down. Schedules are fluid no promises that you won't work close one day then return the next morning for a 6 am shift.
good,Solid supportive management. Pleasant working environment. Healthcare benefits and stock options available after a year. Flexible schedule is problematic as it negatively impacts quality of life.
good,"Publix is a place that gives it's associates room to advance their careers. They offer competitive benefits and high wages for the industry. There are flexible hours, and they will work with you to make your schedule work for you."
good,"Working for Publix has been a wonderful experience. Working there you are surrounded by wonderful people most who really love their jobs and what they do. Most managers really care about their employees and go that extra mile to help out. However, it is hard work. There is a lot of cleaning and preparation that goes into a good workday before the store opens and after. The amount of work done during the day is also extensive which means there is never a dull moment while working here. The greatest emphasis is placed on customer satisfaction and it is our job to make sure each customer leaves wanting to come back."
good,working in the customer service area was a slower paced environment. Most of the employees and managers were pleasant to work with. It was always easy to discuss changes with a manager.
good,"If you like a fun fast pace environment this is the best place to work."
good,"there is nothing to complain about this comany, only about work hours. if you have a long time with the company that is what they take in consideration when putting employees in the am or pm shift."
good,"Never enough time or help to get everything done. Daily job functions include; checking dates and quality of product, receiving and working new product to shelf (good amount of heavy lifting), working through back stock, maintaining floral department, assisting customers, overseeing associates on floor and in cut room."
good,The job was enjoyable experience and being a cashier was a great fun job..
good,"Positive place. Work, co-workers, environment, management, hours all good. Was not there long enough for benefits - a negative. However, if able to get full time employment, the benefits are good."
good,"Pleasant place to work but not much room for advancement, unless you have family working within the company. I do not see that it is Equal Opportunity Employment."
good,The work was very exact and fast paced.  Did not leave a lot of time for things family wise because of staffing issues. the manager I had was not very understanding or helpful when it came to production and gave no positive feedback in regards to employee work. I learned a lot when it came to working in a bakery but was not happy with the way the manager handled the department.  the assistant managers were great.
good,"Publix is honestly a great place to work. Employees get raises every six month, stock options, and benefits. It’s a fantastic experience, but a life time career is not for everyone."
good,"The nature of this job depends primarily on the location and your relationship with your immediate supervisor. I had great success stories, but was stalemated in the end by having a set of incompetent bosses. They left shortly after I did. The cap off and differentiation between regular hourly employees and management is vastly unfair, and working your way up is hard. I've seen under qualified employees get a break, and the most qualified people stay behind in lower paid situations because of how cutthroat management truly is with this company. I did, however, appreciate the stock options, and left with around 11k in the end."
good,Publix will give back what you put into it. If you just want a job to show up and leave thats what you'll get but if you want something good you need to be willing to work long hard hours. They'll say Family first but that is only true until you get into management.
good,"Nice atmosphere,family oriented ,a nice store i like the set up and feel of the company and benefits there.i would recommend someone looking for a job in a friendly environment to apply here for a job that offers new aspects in jobs."
good,Working at Publix for all these years has been very good to me even more so than I ever thought I would have as a part-time worker. All the managers I have had so far have been kind and understanding and even some that try to help me with my hours at work. The work is long but the company has kept me moving to do a good job everyday.
good,"The hours could get pretty long depending on the day, but overall it's been a good experience. As with any job, it's entirely dependent on what manager you get"
good,"work is fast paced, learned how to bake and decorate, management encourages you to move up and test for higher positions.  They work with you on you weak areas.  Hardest part of job was sometimes meeting the quotas they set for you.  Most enjoyable part of job was meeting the people in the store.  workplace culture was great."
good,"Nice job and pays every week, very fun and family environment, good food and good people to work with. The most fun i have Had at a Job met some of my best friends at my store management was cool but could use work."
good,At the time the job seemed very fun but got in the way of me doing school. I didn't like the fact they made me constantly go outside for carts when there's others not doing there part. but overall the job is fine.
good,Publix gives a lot of benefits to  it's  associates.  The sky  is the  limit for advancement if you put  in  the  work. There  are  slow days  and extremely  busy  days and  schedules vary. Publix  has taught me to do many different jobs within the bakery. I am proficient in all areas. Publix also   has on going trainings for all associates. In the right  store there is  team work and it feels like family.
good,We were trained to provide exceptional customer service and make sure all customers leave happily and with a smile and we even insisted on walking them out with their buggy
good,"Publix is a great place to work for benefits.  Their retirement is not matched by many.  If willing to relocate, advancement can go quickly is some departments."
good,"I enjoyed working for Publix during my time. Management worked well with employees. Each 6 months, a fair evaluation is given with the opportunity for a raise. The company is family oriented and customer-service focused."
good,"Busy, customer service is key"
good,"Great pay and room for advancement; however, the rotating schedule is not ideal for families. The atmosphere is fun and you will meet a lot of different cultures."
good,The store itself is great and had great people and managers. They kept the store very clean and very welcoming.  The store has lots of positions that can be learned very quickly. You learn how to operate machinery and life lessons you may need in the future. The job has lots of great people and opportunities.
good,"When I worked for Publix, I worked as a customer service representative. Working for for Publix was, for the most part, pretty steady. During the holidays is there busiest times."
good,"This was a great company for me to launch myself into the workforce. I enjoyed getting to know and always helping my customers. Management sometimes put their jobs before the well being of their associates. Overall, It was a good place to work if you get the good managers."
good,"Everyone was nice and helpful, everyone including the manager were very polite and sweet. Very comfortable place to work or v volunteer at they have patients with you when u started a new."
good,"It was fast pace.  Good environment. Enjoyed working with people,"
good,"Publix was a very good place to work despite it being a very demanding job. I might have made it a long term career had it not been for my children and I having to go through a very traumatic, personal experience."
good,"I’ve worked for PUBLIX for 15 years. They are a pretty good company when it comes to benefits & providing the hours for full timers. However, the stress level can be pretty high because of the unrealistic expectations from those in upper management. If you like a challenge & enjoy working in a fast pace environment then PUBLIX will be a great fit for you."
good,It's a great place to start your career.  Your own department managers listen to you but all other managers outside of your dept. won't really care that much.
good,"If your looking to make a career of Publix then yes this would be excellent to persons. It's fast pace, you would make make some mistake others may cost you your job. If you want to use the restroom you have to ask sometime they tell you no. Or find someone else to cover for you. If your not back with in two or three minutes there call for you over the intercom."
good,"I enjoyed working there because there was always something to do even when there was no customers.  Everyone worked as a team so it made for a great work environment.  When I worked a morning shift, I was responsible for either making sandwiches or preparing sub kits for the sandwich shop.  If I closed the department, I was responsible for cleaning the department (cleaning slicers, windows, counters), doing inventory on the deli meats in the display case, prepping for the morning crew."
good,"Great company with stock options and retirement. Not great if you have a family since nights, weekends, and holidays are required. 401 K is a plus, as well as opportunity to work for an employee owned company."
good,Extremely stressful work environment.  Pay is good but management shows favoritism with certain associates.  You are encouraged to go into management but endure even more stress.
good,"Publix is one of the best supermarkets in the nation. It's also a great workplace. Publix is clean, great atmosphere, and good place for advancement. I would recommend this place."
good,"Theres some slow days and then there are some faster days, depends what department you are at. Co-workers are very friendly and willing to work with you along with most of the managers."
good,It's a great job for Young kids in College or Older folks in their 40's and up. The overall pay grade for South Florida isn't really anything you can support yourself on if you were on your own with no help.
good,"I believe publix is a great place to work you work along side a lot of friendly people, its a very fast place to work which I enjoyed. I did have a few problems with management that was really my only problem working for publix."
good,"Publix has been a great place to work. When I was going to school and working another part-time job, they were very willing to work around them. The pay is average for a part-time job."
good,"It's a great first job kind of place. A lot of young people are essential when it comes to working cashiering, but after a while, it gets boring and you would like to advance. There's no advancement in Publix, however. People I used to work with were there for 20+ years and have the same exact position. I wish they could let you advance."
good,"They aren't very lenient when it comes to physical appearance, as you must be constantly groomed to their standards however the benefits are great, though hours can be very inconsistent."
good,It was alright didn't get paid enough though I paid more in baby sitters than I got paid had to leave though I had to much going on at the time so I had to quit
good,"Over all, Publix was a good place to work. However, the pay and family time was limited and slow. Give a lot to the company, but got little back. Fun to work with customers. To have the authority to help any customer or associate during business times."
good,This was a wonderful place to work. It offers a lot of perks for the employees. If you want to move up its easy to do so. They will also work around your schedule for school if you attend.
good,"Lots of young people"
good,"if your still young or your just coming to this country this is a good place to start. They also give you a fair chance to move up in the company, switch departments, and give  you chances for raises every 6 months."
good,"Publix is a great company overall, but if you were to go into management just be ready for Publix to dictate your life. The managers schedules are inconsistent and work every holiday. The benefits and stock are great. The typical day at Publix is smooth, depending on what location and store you are at. I've learned customer service through Publix. The hardest part about working for Publix as a manager is being away from family all the time."
good,I think its just time for me to find another job been doing this job for about 12 years now and I think its about time for me to move on now and find something better
good,A great job for a teen to start off working at young age good pay and pretty good management. Good people to work with there aswell as a friendly environment
good,"I was treated wonderfully at Publix and I will miss it! However, I was not given enough hours in order to provide for myself. They offer wonderful benefits."
good,Its retail which is not my favorite but there is definite room for advancement all you have to do put in a little effort. The managers pay attention and are willing to work with you and your schedule. I was super blessed with awesome mangers but not all mangers are that way. Publix has extremely high standards which makes it a much better place to work and shop.
good,"Not really a bad place to work. hard to get fired. if they dont like you  they will just cut your hours down very low. the raises are low, and the starting pay is small. they got away from giving employees bonuses so they could build more stores. its an employee owned company, so if you do it right and you buy stock, you can become a millionaire pretty quick. i honestly felt pretty valued as an employee and i was treated pretty well. some of the managers that are closer to retiring are pretty grumpy. over all if they payed better i'd gladly stay longer"
good,"A typical shift allows me to interact with many customers in a fast-paced and friendly environment.  I am enjoying the opportunity to continue working on my customer service and people skills while running the register or assisting customers with their groceries to their vehicles. "
good,"Publix is a great employer overall; it is ideal for someone who wants to advance quickly. However, the hours weren't that great. If you work the second shift, you basically spend your whole life at work."
good,Very friendly and nice place to work. Healthy environment to be around. Very flexible with schedules and just your overall needs. Very pleasing to put smiles on customers faces.
good,No lunch or break during 12 hour work day was difficult. Customer is always right culture which make some people act like they are entitled.  Other pharmacists are nice and willing to help if you have problems with the system.
good,"Typical work day was physically and mentally exhausting. I learned howto operate the floor jack that is driven and also how Publix restocks all of its stores. The management was poor, there were way to many work hazards that could have been avoided. Workplace culture was nice. The hardest part of the job was staying healthy and avoiding work accidents and hazards. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay rate."
good,It's a really good job.. especially for a high school and college students. I will give it an 8 out of 10. Will recommend to to high/college students.
good,"I package out items, I deal with customers, and I decorate cakes, pies and cupcakes. I have learned how to deal with the public, and how to make people happy. The management is awesome and are willing to help you advance. The workplace is fun, and the hardest part of the job is to make sure that people are satisfied. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a customer completely happy with the product."
good,"Publix is a good company with good benefits. They offer employee stock and offer an employee credit union where you can apply for car, house and personal loans."
good,"Was a good place to move up in. Very relaxed work environment and people are very understanding. If you are looking for a relaxed, easy, balanced pace job, Publix is a great place to start a career."
good,Managers and executives really listen to their employees and are open to new ideas. Employees have a lot of opportunity for growth and/or department change if requested. Very good for a first time or part time job.
good,Publix is one of the work places that you could apply and stay in for the rest of your life. There are so many different ways to move up and different departments you can apply for.
good,everything about publix is great. I just feel like they are weeding out employees based on money issues and logistics. I love to help the customers that shop there.
good,The typical day at work is routine same motions to finish task daily. I have learned the different ways to manage my team members each crew member is different in ways of learning and following through. There are many types of management ideas and ways to reach goals and using a business strategy to stay on task. Culture is behind it but not followed by everyone making it more difficult for others.  Understanding the learning curves of individuals and getting them to retain basic standards. the most enjoyable part of the job is having a since of accomplishments.
good,"The department you work in dictates the pace that you are going to be working at. In the Customer Service department, its simple menial labor to bag and cashiering is not too much harder as the UI is simple and straightforward. Only on the weekend is there any really fast paced movement. The other departments, on the other hand, can be much faster paces as there are far fewer people in the department. Management can be great or not so great, depending on how long they have been in management as they can forget sometimes how much the floor associates work. Advancement can happen, but won't always unless you pester about it. Trying to transfer departments is a nightmare as it is up to the district manager to decide how many people each department can have, and they tend to err on the side of efficiency. Workers comp is also tough as they first have you ""looked at"" by an over the phone nurse who, most likely, will tell you to ice and take advil and you will be fine."
good,Management styles vary between managers. Most co workers try hard but some aren't cut out for the job. Mangers say more bad things than good. Less thank yous and more you didn't do this right.
good,"My first job I ever worked at while I was in college and it was really a growing experience. The location of it is very inviting and everyone, if not most, workers in the store were extremely nice. I liked working here because it offered a lot of flexibility. Also, everyone knew their roles so you don't have to compensate for others. The job is fairly easy and repetitive. It's all a matter of what time and day it is when you get a rush of customers or busy business."
good,I have been working at Publix for about a year. It has been quite the journey. I have met a lot of great people in the past year at Publix and made a lot of new friends. I love my customers they are always a pleasure to serve. Overall I have enjoyed my work experience at Publix.
good,I work in the kitchen in the deli and its a lot of hard multi-tasking responsibilities. I have learned so many jobs like slicing meats and cheeses and making subs. I also learned about frying and preparing the hot cases for the customers all day.
good,"We enjoy working in this company they threat each other as a family. They are very approachable to a customer,i hope philippines can include to their list that thay can sponsor those filipino that is very hard working"
good,"When I got to work, I would greet customers and go to my department (produce) and rotate stock, and help customers find what they needed. It was an enjoyable environment and a nice pace where one does not feel always behind, as with some other jobs."
good,Was fresh out of school and was working part- time and wanted a fulltime position. I had resigned due to schedule issues and also had no transportation.
good,Publix is very good at hiring people that are friendly and professional.  Everyone that I have worked with has been great.  Benefits are fantastic. Work days are quite long having days off during the week is nice.
good,I had an awesome time being employed at Publix Supermarket. The experience taught me a lot about team work and taking care of customers to the very best of my ability.
good,"The deli was messy and mostly stressful, but the pay was decent and the company was nice. Customers can be very pushy, but if you're able to brush it off, it's an okay job."
good,"Working here is a commitment. Depending on the department, your hours can be 4 AM - 2 PM, 7 AM- 3 PM, or night shift which can end at midnight if the store received a late night rush. Customer service is the ideal department if you dislike heavy lifting and getting your hands dirty. The potential for growth is good as well."
good,Publix is a good company to work for. They offer great benefits and advancement opportunities.They will help you get where you want to be if you show initiative that you want to advance.
good,"The deli department is one of the most fast-paced jobs in Publix. You are always busy attending customers, making sandwiches, keepin the work area clean, etc. They have fair wages, however, and a very nice 401k package."
good,"Publix is a OK place to work for full time employees, however , I think that it is unfair that part time employees receive none of the benefits the full time employees do."
good,"A typical day at work is busy from start to finish. You do get an hour lunch and two 15 minute breaks. When we worked overnight we could listen to our music, but it could be so loud that you couldn't hear the manager."
good,Working for Publix was a good way to get my work experience started. Publix was my first job and taught me the importance of punctuality and customer service.
good,What's not to love about Publix? They have amazing benefits including employee owned stock. I have been buying Publix subs on my breaks for 11 years now. The customer and patient are always put first giving them a sense of confidence in the company.
good,"I learned that having premier customer service can really change someone's day from being bad to good. I enjoyed giving that customer service and helping others if they were confused about which product to but or to return items. I didn't enjoy the customer service representatives. They were rude and were extremely hard on each and every one of the co-workers. Other than that, I enjoyed my time at Publix. They also have wonderful benefits."
good,It's a nice friendly environment and great customer service! The team is always willing to go that extra mile to please our customers. BOGO's are a very nice addition to Publix along with great values for the customers.
good,you will come in breakdown the trucks and separate them on floats for different aisles. work them to the shelves save overstock and put them to the corresponding birds until we work our overstock
good,Publix is a great learning experience for everyone. You learn the lives of other people and just how much you affect them by saying hello everyday. It was surprising just how much people looks forward to seeing you even though you are just an employer at Publix.
good,"I liked working at Publix. If the hours were not so depressing ( I worked 5pm to 2am), it would have been wonderful. I loved my management team and the crew I had. It was a physically demanding job but it kept you busy. Retail is not easy in geneal and the grocery husiness is a demanding one. A problem I had was needing to be in too many places at once. It seemed the job never ended and followed me home. The benefits, such as owning Publix stock, were a nice gift. Their PTO for full timers was great and paid holidays. I left because my husband started have health issues with his medication and I needed to be home at night."
good,"Stay busy, do your job, listen to managment and you will succeed quickly. Make sure you show up to work ehen you are schedualed. Try not to call out as much as possible."
good,I've learn how to speak to customers and learn how to serve and speak with a smile. Publix was where everything became a smile even on our bad days of business
good,I learned alot at Publix.  I learned how to train and develop associates and learned alot of the financial part of management. A typical day would be stressful for the opening manager because we would be by ourselves and to set the floor break the trucks down and if it was Sunday we would have to complete a P&L statement.
good,"The job itself is actually quite enjoyable. The management sometimes lack the ability to hire people who can work well with others. "
good,"Nice place to work but management is not fair what so ever, I've been working there for a minute and no promotions or anything unless your one of there favoites."
good,Publix is a very rewarding company to work at i 've grown with the company and its my very first job and they love my srong will and determination to work hard until the job is done. And my reliability..also how i caught on to different departments so fast.
good,I liked it at Publix. I loved taking out customers groceries and helping them unload it into their individual cars. I liked their uniform and the fact that they sold fresh groceries. I love their produce and bakery. Publix is okay.
good,It really too too much to say. I enjoyed it while it lasted. Needs to be less lenient towards smaller mistakes when not at fault. Lacks minor management skills.
good,"The workplace was full of friendly people, with wonderful attitudes. The environment was great for productivity. A family feeling is present as soon as walk in, very enjoyable place to work."
good,"This was my first job, and I'm very grateful for the experience. If you stay to become full time, they have fantastic benefits. It can be exhausting in the same way all customer service jobs are, but I enjoyed feeling like I made a small difference in my customer's day and I made a few friends from the regulars that I'm still in touch with. I will go back to work there if I'm ever in need of a job again."
good,Publix is a great company to work for.  There are great benefits and opportunities for advancement.  There are many opportunities at Publix for advancement.
good,"I just feel like a lot of work and responsibility is placed on to few workers. There is a lot of work that involved, and not enough employeesto finish in a timely manor."
good,Very busy displaying products on shelves helping customers find products. Learning how to use products and educate customers. Being part of a first class team providing customer service.
good,"A typical day of work consists of greeting and communicating with customers, solving issues patiently and effectively, knowing where products are located, basic math skills. I learned from this job that I want to focus hard on school so I never have to work a part-time job again. While their benefits for part time are great, school benefits included, I aspired for more. As far as management, I wish they would tell the workers when they did a good job instead of only the negative. The workers, specifically the baggers were some of the nicest and most helpful people I have had the pleasure of meeting. Also, the Publix culture is great. The hardest part of my job was not having a steady schedule and standing my entire shift."
good,"Everytime I go to work here I have to make sure that I am in a good mood and that I am following rules, I have learned a lot of people skills and to become more outgoing as a result but I have also had to deal with rude managers too which is probably the hardest part of the job, some of the manager at the company I work at can be very strict, but the most enjoyable part of the job is making friends with the co-worker and customers."
good,"If you cannot find anything better out there, publix is not a bad choice. Some pros: stable job, hard work does not go unnoticed, and plenty of opportunities for advancement. Some cons: long hours, weekends and holidays, on your feet all day."
good,"Publix had a great environment. In the store that I worked in there were a lot of ""regulars"" so it was nice to get to know the community. This company will take care of you and treat you like their own kin."
good,"My experience was on and off at Publix. There were plenty of departments to crosstrain in if you weren't happy with the one you were with and the benefits were worth every hour there. A good place to make a career with and the pay was always above minimum wage. You get a raise every six months if you do good. The only downside I can think of is that it's the same work day in and day out. I got bored quickly with the job and you have to always be in a good mood to work there. Good customer service is the key to Publix success. All in all, it was a good experience and a great place to make a career at. Just not for me personally."
good,"Nice place great benefits, great coworker environment great place to form lasting friendships, possibly retire a millionaire and live comfortably if wanted"
good,"I started this job when i was 19 years old, just got outta highschool a year before. Been going at it for 2 years now. And im ready for like more adult job. Publix is a kind of job where you just got outta high school. I rather have a more exciting job than scanning groceries all day"
good,Publix atmosphere is great I love working there it has great benefited and advancement is great .it doesn't take long to move up with this company I never had any complaints
good,"Publix, like any retail has its ups and downs, but the company as a whole is good to work for. Some management is better then others and every store has different customers, so clientele can vary by location, making the day better or worse."
good,Great benefits and overall treats their people well.  I enjoyed my time at Publix and the opportunities and training I received there.  Would recommend for those willing to deal with their expectations
good,"I enjoy working here. I've been here since I was younger. I started off as a bagger, worked my way to a cashier. I am currently a customer service staff."
good,It is nice to work here and there are many kind people as my associates but trying to advance in the company is difficult. If you don't have a friend higher up in the company then it takes a very long time to get promoted. Sometimes you get a hit or miss on your manager.
good,"Publix was my first official job and I loved it. There were very few things about the company that I didn't like. The people were great, the customers were usually pretty friendly, and the management was tight and effective. Very few people quit the company once they got in. Its purpose is based around customer service. The customer first."
good,Publix has an excellent workplace culture and really cares about its employees well being. You can have a flexible work schedule and they promote you when you are a hard worker.
good,Coworkers make the job worth fighting for  every one boost each other up. I don't always agree with how things are being run. it takes a lot of patience to be a deli worker.
good,Great company to work for! Its fun and exciting meeting new people. Plenty of opportunity for advancement. Management teams are great often involved in team building. The best part of this job is taking care of the customers!
good,"Typical grocery store, ring up customers & assist with go-backs. Busier stores are better, time goes by faster, perfect for high school students and retired individuals."
good,I clock into work and go to the Customer Service Counter and take over for my Co-worker and count the till. Then I start taking care of the customers that come to the service desk and need help. I have learned to be more talkative to the customers and my co-workers are amazing. The management varies on how they deal with people and how they interact with us. The hardest part of my job is dealing with customers that don't want to be nice. The best part of my job is being myself around others that enjoy my company.
good,"A typical day was coming in getting started at my duties, meeting/greeting  co-workers for the day and hardest part not  completing work at end of day"
good,"Publix offers training modules every month to every other month and managers make sure we stay on top of it. These training modules helps us stay aware of our surroundings and how to keep our work environment clean, customer friendly and safe. "
good,"A typical day at work was washing hands a lot and serving sandwiches. I learned proper cleaning methods and ways to prepare lunch in the best possible ways. My management was pretty organized my schedule was always consistent. My co-workers were the best part of the job. my hardest part of the job was staying so late, luckily I lived close by but if you work in the deli that is quite busy, expect late late nights to 1AM even in the schedule is for 12. My most enjoyable part of the job was seeing regular customers come through to brighten my day. You build good connections to people."
good,"It's a good place to work.  Plenty of hours during the holiday season. Not enough during the off season. "
good,"Great company to work for but a little mick picky about the small stuff. Good pay good long hours easy to pull down  $800 a week ; manage hours if your hours are closing on 40. Good management  staff."
good,"I honestly love working for publix, most of the people are friendly and supportive. There are great benefits working here as well, but it can be difficult to move to different positions and even harder to change departments."
good,Great environment to work in if you like customer service.  Still has the same drills of working at a grocery store but does offer great benefits and a chance to own a part of the company.
good,My experience with Publix has made me grow as an individual. The company is family oriented and the management is supportive.
good,Working for Publix was a pleasant experience .It was a very positive workplace and you met new people and learned new things everyday. i would love to work there again.
good,"I have been with Publix for going on four years and I hope to continue working there some while I pursue my career in healthcare. We received great benefits and pay. I learned how to effectively run the front end of the store. It is a great place to learn delegation and leadership. I do not plan on making a career out of it because I do not feel like it is my calling, but i have enjoyed the last few years I have invested into Publix."
good,"Held responsibility in generating daily equipment checklist and ensuring that equipment were safe to operate before the start of the shift"
good,A good place to work. It is difficult to get full time due to the standards of part time ratio to full time. The benefits are good if you can earn enough work credit hours to apply.
good,Loved the company extremely professional. Nice staff friendly environment.The customers are friendly and some are quite demanding . The hardest part about this job is how busy the store gets unexpectedly.
good,A typical day at work consist of greeting customers (new and old). Making sure everyone experience was satisfying when they left the store. Very friendly atmosphere.
good,"Publix truly is a great place to work. For some people, advancement can take longer or not so long to move up depending on what that person desires. Publix doesn't hire full timers from the start. I've been part time for 7 years still trying to get full time. They are very stingy when it comes to full time but location plays a key role in what your outcome will be like. Managers are nice and work with you on time off requests. Pay is good."
good,"it is a good beginner job and most of what a teenager or high school student or college student needs to learn about a job during his first few years, like what a actual interview is like and the consequences of not showing up to work"
good,"My time at Publix has been decent so far. It is an ok company if you are looking to make some extra money. Don't expect FT there, because you will never get it. If you are looking for a set schedule or a consistent amount of hours per week, forget it. Overall,  as a housewife, or as a high school/college student it's ok, beats Walmart or McDonald's."
good,"I enjoyed working for Publix. They treat their employees well, give raises based on performance, and promote from within. Overall I give them an A+."
good,"Its a friendly place to work, customers are almost always leave with a smile. If you're wanting a part time job this is a great place to work if you want full time you have to be extremely lucky or look elsewhere. Managers are generally very friendly and usually always willing to listen. The hardest part would be making sure every customer is satisfied in a timely manner."
good,"typical work day- depends on management. "
good,"Atmosphere is great, but compensation and work hours are rough. Also, evaluations do not always reflect actual hard work."
good,This was a good first job to have. It taught me a lot of respect and responsibility for others.This company cares about customer service more than any place I've ever encountered.
good,Everyone around you is polite and hard-working and helping to get the task finished. The work environment is at a steady pace.
good,"A supermarket that prides its self on superior customer service compared to other supermarkets. Since the founders passing, the current CEO continues to streamline the company and develop rules and policies that have been negatively impacting the companies goal of providing customer service."
good,"Publix takes care of their employees, has great training methods, and offers good benefits all around. There are opportunities for advancement available to all associates. Many employment opportunities exist outside of their retail stores as well."
good,"Productive workplace with great co-workers, everyone functions like a family and only separated by departments. Learned a lot about customer service and picked up many problem solving skills. Management was overall well as long as you do your part."
good,"The typical day at work is fine, but the repetitiveness does tend to get old after a few years. "
good,"I learn a lot of experience"
good,"Publix offers great benefits and great opportunities not only advance in the company, but in the community as well. They are very flexible with the scheduling and are very understanding about life events such as deaths, weddings, graduations, etc. The only draw back with Publix is slightly too much micromanaging."
good,"This job demands your life, literally. If you ware a person with children to support and that is your only plan then this is the job for you. On the other hand if you are a person who values your time then this is not the place. I resigned after almost 2 years giving 60hrs a week selecting cases [body aching, sleep deprived ( 4pm - 7am sometimes)], this job is literally modern day slavery."
good,"the Publix Deli clerk in the hardest part of the job ,busy all day i learned a lot how to treat the greeting customers the most important and help them friendly and invite them back"
good,Decent job. Worked about a year of full time hours with the promise of being made a full time employee but never happened. Part time employees lose out on a lot of benefits and bonuses. Most managers seemed to be lazy also. I literally had to train someone else my first day working there because I had previous experience stocking groceries.
good,"I loved my job but the people that was there was drama filled. I liked my cashiering job. A typical day would be loving customers, with laughs and smile, I've learned that doing what you love would bring so much joy. The management was an okay management but sometimes they could be off of their jobs and be snobby."
good,"Demanding workplace,100% customer service and performance with a positive environment and very carrier driven. Company has taught me to be a team motivator and to communicate in a professional manor to associates and customers."
good,"A typical work day at Publix is very busy waiting on customers, keeping the floor stocked and preparing baked goods for sale. Management is fair and my co-workers are dedicated to working together to keep our customers satisfied and the bakery department running smoothly."
good,"Publix is a great company to work for and has great health and wellness benefits. They also offer paid vacations for full time employees and an excellent retirement plan. Each morning consists of checking online orders and custom orders in store to assure orders are completed in full and on time. I then generate our production list for the forecasted day and begin prioritizing tasks for myself and my associates. I work as a part of a team on orders in addition to helping customers in store, answering phones and managing my time wisely in order to complete said tasks. The best part of the job is the associates I work with and the overall team based environment. Management is quick to respond whenever I have questions so I can relay them to my fellow associates."
good,"A growing, employee owned company that is fair in most of its aspects. Managers vary on different ideals for the stores, so it can be frustrating to have to do things differently every day depending on what manager is working. I personally believe that there should be a way that works for everyone to achieve as much as possible in a work day."
good,"Was the first company I ever worked for, and they are still working for me today thru stock, and ESOP.  I would work for them again, if the right opportunity presented itself."
good,Through out the process of adjusting to this as my first job. They gave me training for two days which help grab essential concepts. Of how to bag and treat a customer in any scenario. Having been prepared i was sent into the floor where i started bagging and was very nervous. Due to the amount of items each customer had and how to bag them. However after a while I have grabbed onto the skills where now in my own opinion its very simple and a nice occupation for some extra money.
good,My day typically involved slaving over a fryer and working very hard to keep up with the demand since there is only ever one person cooking chicken in the deli.
good,"Overall a fantastic company to work for! Have worked at Publix going on 20 years. Great corporate leadership with a vision for on going expansion into the foreseeable future. If I had the chance to do it all over again, I would only change one thing... I would have started with them sooner. Retirement is solid, stock has had excellent ROI . Lakeland, FL is the corporate HQ. The IT department has been recognized by industry peers as a great place to work.  One of the country' largest employee owned companies with over 100K+.  Based in the southeast, FL.  GA. AL. TN. NC. SC. and with plans for expansion into VA."
good,Great environment to work in with many friendly coworkers. Great managment and advancment. A typical day had me work hard and effiecently with long hours.
good,"Probably the best retail job for a part timer because they like to spoil their workers. Advancement is extremely competitive, but if you got the moxie, they will notice and move you up!"
good,"I had a great experience working at Publix. It was a really busy environment, always doing something. I did have random shifts but I was always willing to work them. The best part of working at Publix is being able to work as a team. Also, I was always able to move up and get a pay increase."
good,Great place to start if you're going to stay for a while. Customers are great. Management may be a little a*al. The break times are very good. Great holidays
good,"It's a great company to work for but it's always some self-righteous management who has no love for it's fellowman. Their motives I got mine and it took me a long time to get where I am, I am not going to let you spoil it for me. I had more job ethics than some of this managers. It's not the company faults; it is those who put a face than in reality their just con artist. I had great co-workers. the hardest party of the job management without care. The most enjoyable part serving the customer and they come back to look for you even when you are not at work."
good,"Publix is great company to work, especially if you are a student. It is very accommodating to those furthering their education and have other obligations. Very active in their community and great customer service. However, Publix is not very supportive to their associates not wanting to further their career within the company. Limited number of hours one can accumulate, around thirty, but varies week to week. Does not want to give full time to those who not want to be managers. Very stringent on rules and regulations, and preferences very from manager to manager within store and out, which is difficult to deal with sometime."
good,"Working at Publix in the deli is a very fast paced environment, using problem solving techniques. I learn new things daily, people and customers are a never ending learning experience and to be able to understand the people and communicate in a way that is acceptable is a big part of the challenge. Although once the communication lines are open, working with and training is a wonderful part of the being part of the management team."
good,"I was a great aspect to the store. I bagged groceries, worked in produce etc. People person, worked well with others, and have good communication skills. The co-workers were very helpful, and cooperative. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unsatisfied customers but I did it with a smile."
good,"Management is lazy. The company itself is fantastic and so are the benefits. Th vibes are good, and the fact that there is one on every corner is great if i needed to relocate."
good,"publix is a good company to work for offering growth and a second family good pay, management positions available and stock ownership"
good,"Routinely everyday have too clean, stock and weigh up and put on  shelves products. And level by pushing everything up on the shelves. Helping costumiers and putting on amount on trays what they want out of cases. Helping out my team when I get done with my section is done."
good,"awesome co workers, pay is great, sometimes the managers and be a little edgy but overall publix is an awesome place to work, great benefits and job security."
good,"A typical day at work may start early in the morning or later during the day. Sometimes shifts starts as early as 7 a.m. I'm usually scheduled to either cashier, self-check out or service clerk. I learned interpersonal, time management, organizational, as well as behavioral skills. That is I'm able to function adequately in a high-pressured and busy environment. I learned how to properly be responsive and assist customers. "
good,I have been a Publix Supermarket Cashier for over ten years. I have grown to admire the company's professionalism and level of quality when dealing with customers. The company has taught me the importance of providing excellent services and how to be an an excellent customer service provider.
good,"nice management, nice schedule freedom. great staff. everyone gets along. i was glad to be a member of their wonderful company."
good,"There only down fall is there management staff, after 5 years, I constantly seen individual's passed over for promotion due to there gender.  I understand there a equal  opportunity employer however to meet there numbers they dismiss employees and hire non experienced individuals simply to meet a quota"
good,"not a bad place to work felt suppoted and appreciated, just not enough money to live on, fun atmosphere competent management."
good,"What I love about this place is most of the customers love the store and appreciate the service they get. Treatment they can't get at a Walmart or Winn Dixie. You feel proud to be a part of the team! But because of this you also get spoiled customers who know what they can get away with and take advantage. The benefits are great! Even for part timers! After 3 months you qualify for vision and dental insurance! However, for health insurance you must be there a full year and have at least 1000 hours to qualify. It takes most people a really long time to become full time or promoted. Im talking 5-10 years. You have a lot of lazy employees there who get comfortable because they know they have job security with Publix. When you're working hard, and someone else is slacking, it gets really frustrating. Especially when you have to work together. Also, ever so often we get coupons for free Publix items. Like, Publix premium ice cream, or a bakery item, or a Publix Greenwise item, etc. I think corporate knows the importance of their employees happiness. Managers on the other hand, make you feel replaceable. Not all of them but most of them. I think too many of their managers are promoted based more on seniority than skill. Most of them are not team players. Still, you will get different experiences from different stores. Overall, Publix is a good company."
good,"I enjoy working at publix it's a great place to work, but don't plan on getting anywhere if you are not 100% dedicated to Publix, I'm part time and enjoy working there while going to school, but if you are not 100% dedicated to putting up with an ever changing schedule, rude customers and hard days, your not going to go much of anywhere in the company, I wasn't dedicated but if you are you will go far."
good,"helped me grow my customer service skills as well as dealing with money credit card wic etc"
good,"I started out as a bagger, Publix offered decent chances to advance. When I left I was a cashier, working on branching out into other areas. Such as seafood and deli. Before deciding to move. They rewarded hard work. Every six months, if an associate earned it, they received a raise. I liked my co-workers, my managers were nice, the customers.. well they were customers. You had the nice and the not so nice. Publix focused on customer service, I would like to say I learned well from that. They were employee owned and had decent benefits. Eye and dental for part-timers who worked a set numbers of hours, and health for full times. Unfortunately, the job market being what it is, full-time wasn't given out easily. Plus once they knew you were dependable, as I am, they work you hard. Keeping you just under the full time marker. "
good,"Easy, fun place to work. The customers are great and the company gives good benefits. They are flexible with hours and the managers are really supportive."
good,the most enjoyable part of my job is serving others. greeting and assisting.customers with their needs. I would set up for success
good,Good place to work when you have good managers supporting you. Great benefits especially if you get full-time but part-time gets good benefits as well.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,Te hardest part of the job is cping with the customers and their rude attitudes. Its great benefits but im looking to move more towards a job thats within my major.
good,Publix is a great company to work for. Its a great environment and provides great benefits for part time and full time employees.
good,"Typical day at work is fairly routine, your job is straight and expectations are known and expected. Hours are flexible and management teams are approachable and friendly."
good,"I am a current student seeking a bachelor degree, Publix was my employer for almost two years. Over that time I never had a problem with my schedule or conflict with my classes, my manager was always very cooperative with the flexibility that I needed. The environment was great, managers and employees in general work together to make Publix a very friendly place to work."
good,"Working retail is always interesting, at Publix the work/life balance is hard with the schedule as a manager; two nights til 11pm and one til 7pm plus opening in the morning and weekends sometimes makes life difficult."
good,"If you are looking for a good part-time, then this is good start, the flexibility offered for you schedule is limitless, work is simple, management is fair, however if you are looking for a full-time then is a bit complicated, especially on customer service field, aside from that, you get rewarded with good benefits."
good,"Good company for work for, they sometimes treat their employees right. There are some in house politics but what big company does not have this. Really good benefits, if you can make it to full time. Great people to work with and I've made some really good friends along the way. The customers are wonderful and can make a bad day get better."
good,"This job does a decent job of coordinating its hours with your personal life. Management usually follow through on small work related requests, and job advancement is not to difficult."
good,"I had a really good experienced w/ Publix. The way the company delivered their customer service is just exemplary, and I learned a lot from it."
good,I have learned to open up more to people. I have gained knowledge and experience in the customer service industry. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new customers. I thoroughly enjoy working with my co workers and management.
good,"Publix is a great and clean grocery store. Makes customers feel welcomed when they first enter into the doors. This is the job that really taught me customer service skills and how to deal with people, even when they were being difficult. This job also taught me structure, moving at a fast pace, and always treating the customers with a smile."
good,I come in and clock in I find out what my schedule is and some times im on the register and some times im bagging. I have learned a lot how to communicate with the customer and I can do a lot more then I thought I can do. management is good. I like my coworkers I get along with all of them. there is no hard part I like it
good,"This was probably the second best establishment I have ever been employed by and would work there again in no time. Now only if they would allow employees to work full-time so they may qualify for benefits, thats the only down side I see to working there."
good,my most enjoyable time is interacting with my customers they really brighten my day knowing that just by asking can I help you find something can make a persons day
good,"Easy going schedule, nice co-workers, opportunities to advance in the company. Management was fair, firm, and willing to work with you to improve."
good,"Management was fine, sometimes could appear as lazy. Provided satisfactory customer service. Coworkers really made this a great place to work."
good,"A typical day consists of the back and forth between the check out lines and the parking lot sometimes going into the aisle to assist customers. I learned a lot of valuable customer service experience and a few management skills. The co-workers are amazing about 90% of the time and the other 10 you can usually avoid rather easily."
good,"Meeting, greeting, and assisting customers locate items in the store is an awesome experience. The atmosphere of people shift everyday that can vary from brightening up someone's day to quickly catching a customer before leaving the parking lot to give them the correct change."
good,long hours always busy coworkers are amazing and friendly and made the work day a pleasure to go through. some managers were extremely helpful and easy to get along with while others made work very difficult.
good,The experience was very nice.  I learned a lot about produce and have a better understanding of fruit and vegetables but I was constantly looking for employment in aviation when I worked there.
good,"Working for Publix has taught me a lot. I never decorated a cake before I started working here. There was a position open, I took the challenge and have been exceeding. All of this is great but I have grown to realize I would like a stable schedule, not waking up some days at 4am and other days going in at 1pm."
good,"A great place to work if you can put up with a few downsides. The work is tedious and the hours are sometimes punishing but the pay is great. Management and coworkers is are about the same as anywhere else: Some great people, some not so great."
good,"After clocking in id head right on to the parking lot and gather all the shopping carts. "
good,worked as cashier but learned many other jobs. great people and customers. you can advance and work in many depts if you want to. the only down side if your part time you don't get many hours per week.
good,"Publix distribution is a greatly respected company. I enjoyed my time there because I learned to protect assets on an industrial level, my co workers and I shared a mutual and respectful work relationship."
good,great job teaches you how to operate a machine .management is good help you out whenever there's a problem . the most enjoyable part is you can move up and learn more
good,"My years at Publix first began wonderful. As a first job, I didn't know much about anything, and I didn't really need too. Great staff, felt like family. I was in high school so the pay seemed just fine, and work was pretty straight to the point. Management seemed too fond of store gossip, often partaking in spreading rumors about their employees. As far as a career, you got to know one of the top dogs to move up in Publix."
good,Outstanding job to have with great pay and benefits and you get to work a wide range of awesome people who take taking care of their customers to another degree
good,Its a great company To work for with being the benefits they offer and how flexible they are with availability. I enjoy for Publix Supermarkets because of the work culture.
good,"Very comfortable work environment. I absolutely enjoyed working there. Management was great, and the opportunites for advancement and cross-training were easily maintainable."
good,"A typical day at work involves making sure that customers are satisfied when they leave, that fellow employees are performing their duties, and that registers balance during the day and at the end of the night. I have learned about cash balancing, interpersonal skills, and how to remain calm in stressful situations. Managers are rotated often. Most co-workers are easy to get along with and have become good friends. The hardest part of the job is making sure the customers needs are met completely. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with awesome managers who understand the stresses of work."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Publix ! I relocated to Florida for a year and am very happy that I was employed there."
good,"fun and entertaining customers and very fast paced "
good,"This job has been a very good job, however, it's taking more time away from my family than I had hoped. I'm not opposed to working full time, that's actually what I want, but the hours are not suitable for my family."
good,the pay is great pay and the benefits as well. its not hard to move up with the company at all
good,It was a great place of employment. You will have lots of different jobs to learn.
good,"it is a great place to work, i love learned everything there, Optimistic an so on. I mange in helping others and my co-workers are great.i have enjoyed working at Publix Supermarket"
good,"Competitive pay ,but not many hours for part time workers. learned much about the industry and departments."
good,"A ordinary work day at Publix is very busy, fast past and enjoyable. To start the day off i greet customers after clocking in, followed by addressing anyone who may need help. I scan products for sale as well as any money services. Toward the end of my shift i am given the task to either balance the cash office or delegate front end operations. Working here i have learned how to be efficient in my work due handling large amounts of money. Management was nice and organized. They showed concern to everyone's well-being within the job regardless of part time or full time positions. Co workers were friendly and got along well. They listened and performed well whenever asked. The hardest part about the job was being accommodating to everyone's issues. There were times where we were short staffed and employees couldn't perform specific task due to health issues. The most enjoyable part about working at Publix were the customers. They were always so pleasant and appreciative of the service we provided."
good,Great place to work. Schedule flexibility and good benefits.
good,"Cooking different foods such as chicken, rice, fish, taking and completing customer orders, providing great customer service,"
good,"Publix is a great place to work however this job is not for everybody. Only the srongest one will survive due to job schedule everyday. The co-workers are all fun and enjoy to work with. Love to serve customer everyday, love to see customer leave happy with smile on their face. The hardest part is only work schedule where we have to be available on weekend and also during holiday seasons."
good,A typical day at work requires me to work in a fast paced environment and provide our customers with the best customer service they have ever experienced.
good,Providing premier customer service was one of my strong points.
good,"A regular day would consist of standing out in-front of your register, cleaning occasionally, maybe doing go-backs. I learned how to deal with a thousand different people on a daily-basis, The hardest part of the job is standing in one spot all day long. The most enjoyable part is just going to work. Every one there is extremely nice and no matter how bad your day was before you clocked in, when you left you were in a better mood."
good,"Great job for people who are just looking to pass time and bridge. There are many opportunities to move up but I don't feel they are fair in handing out those opportunities. Other than that, I loved it! Great work environment!"
good,"Neurotic management made my particular publix a bad place to work."
good,I am now a new member of the produce department team. A typical day at work consists of setting up the area to prepare fresh and beautiful cup art and cut fruit for our customers. I have an opportunity to greet each customer and find out how I can assist them in having a great shopping experience. Having an easy and outgoing personality has made it a pleasure working with the management as well as the associates there.  I have created wonderful relationships with a number of customers as well. The most difficult part of my job is probably just keeping up with the demand on busy shopping days such as holidays and Sundays. Overall my job is very enjoyable. Especially working with the group of people that I work with on a daily basis.
good,"In my daily duties I worked effectively assisting customers and guidance to them as I also provided premiere customer service. Not only did I complete them to my employer’s satisfaction, but as well as to the top standard of the department."
good,"I went in at 3 am, i learned how to read temperatures on trucks i also learned how to manage between 5 to 10 people."
good,This is the friendliest company I have ever worked for. Management was good at directing and showing that they care. I learned how important good customer service is.
good,This company is an amazing company to work for. It was a great job when i was in school. You can make a career with this company if you want to allow yourself to grow with the company.
good,i like the people i work with and get along with them just fine. its pretty much just whatever they have planned for us that day that we do.
good,At Publix you are serving individuals and families alike with their grocery needs. The atmosphere is fast paced. You are given a 30 minute to 1 hour break for each shift. Management is helpful and friendly.
good,"When I first walk in, I will walk my section and see what needs to be worked first; such as specials, back stock, milk and eggs. In any business customer service is the most important role. Part of that service is making sure that product is accessible for the customers. When I first started I would of given management four stars, but since  we have gotten three new managers my feelings have changed. I'll describe each one in a few words Arrogant, childish; Sketchy; nice guy who cares. The hardest part of the job falls on Sundays; usually the most busiest day of the week. There's a big truck and a ton of customers that enjoy coming in on Sunday. My favorite part of the job is customer relations, it gives me a good feeling when a customer comes up to me and says ""I haven't seen you in a while, where have you been.""  That reassures me that I'm doing my job right."
good,"The greatest thing about working at Publix is the flexibility given. They allow you to customize your hours to fit your school schedule. However, they need to have better management of employees."
good,"It's a great company to work for, always room for advancement, constantly receiving a raise."
good,Publix is the best in Customer Service. While working there you will become proficient in soft skills and exceptional at customer service work. There are many opportunities for employees to advance and grow their careers. The culture is something to embrace and always a fun environment to participate in.
good,"good management, nice clean store, friendly employees,  enjoyed closing the store and helping customers."
good,Publix is a great place to work although you do not get many benefits unless you are full time and it is very difficult to get full time in Publix.
good,"My highlights were getting to know regular customers each visit, while gaining their trust in our business while we developed a friendly rapport."
good,"A typical day included but not limited to overseeing associates in the Customer Service department, assisting customers, working in a fast pace environment, answering phones, cash handling, armored car deliveries & pickups, administration tasks, dealing with hiring paperwork, performing new associate orientation, job class training, writing store news letter, payroll responsibilities and working closely with management."
good,"I enjoy working for Publix very much, I have learned to master my customer service skills with the public. Management team and co-workers are a big family and we work great as a team."
good,Company is employee owed making it family based. Theres little turn over creating a familiar face atmosphere for workers and customers alike. Very customer friendly!
good,"Highly skilled in providing information regarding products and services of company"
good,it was a great place to work.. my co-worker was like family. management was great too.
good,"a typical day working with and helping hundreads of customers and always learning something new,management was helpful and my co workers..the hardest part of my job was rotating shifts, working with all kinds of differnt people."
good,"I would enjoy going to work everyday. "
good,"Great benefits, pay, and room to  advance. Also got free lunch everyday"
good,Hard-working fast pased.  Very diverse workforce as well as management.
good,Making sure store is stock and shelve are clean and level. I have learn that the 10ft rule helps out in life moments as well .management is ok. and fellow co-worker are ok .we work as a team and things run smooth.making sure customer leave with a smile  and knows my name and I know theirs.
good,It was a good company to work for. Had plenty of overtime opportunities. Also they had an onsite office at Sugar Foods Corp so if you had any questions or concerns you could talk directly to the on-site manager.
good,"Regular customer and a steady flow of others makes the day go by faster. Mornings are easier with all of the day's prep work, evening are a chore from cleaning up after everyone."
good,"I am a seafood clerk working part time at Publix as I make my way through college. A typical day for me involves interacting with customers, answering phone calls, product handling, and ensuring that food safety standards are met. "
good,"Following a routine and sticking to it. Bagging groceries, helping customers out to their vehicles and doing odd jobs around the store."
good,Publix is a great place to work. There are many opportunities within the company for advancement.
good,"Good people and hard working associates, also great benefits"
good,"•	Stock shelves"
good,Very good company to work for. They create a schedule around your school hours if you are in school. The one complaint I have is they are very stingy when it comes to offering full-time positions.
good,Great pay and benefits but the managers are not typically the nicest to employees.
good,Dealing with people is one of my strong points and this job allowed me to do this job.  Even when I was a stock clerk I still had to interact with many different people.
good,A typical day at work consists of taking care of customers needs and providing premiere service for their satisfaction. The greatest thing I've learned from working at Publix is the ability to associate with customers and be open. I've also learned a great sese of team work. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unruly and irate customers and also dealing with associates who call out of work and have poor work ethic. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact with pleasant customers and make their day better just by providing great service.
good,"Paid holiday's 401k plan, stocks, paid vacations. good place to work but up & down hours with not enough down time from shift, to shift"
good,"I learned a lot about this company the 5 years I was there! Great, people, benefits, hours, pay.."
good,"Bagged and stocked groceries, help take out groceries. Management  are great and professional."
good,"Good place to work"
good,I was 17 when I started working as a cashier at Publix. I met a lot of great people while working there. 
good, 
good,"Most workday's started at 6:00 AM and you were on the go from the time you set foot on the floor. I would first print off reports from the computer and compile them and make a cutting list for the meat cutter's before they came in. Everyday that I worked there was an order of some type that had to be put in . The job included alot of hands on assisting our co-workers also, to prepare the products for customer's to buy.  The hardest part of the job was finding the time to complete paperwork. The most enjoyable part was assisting the customer's and at the end of the day knowing that we had done great job!         "
good,You get the chance to succeed and work in a stress free enviroment.
good,foi muito bom trabalhar com as pessoas que estao atualmente mais algumas não 
good,"I think this is a very good company to work for with a high customer service level. A typical day is to provide premier customer service, management and their style of leading varies across the board, I have been with the company over eleven years so there is hardly anything that isa problem for me."
good,"Life in the deli can be tough. It is the toughest job in the whole store. You have a ton of things to learn but you don't get trained on any of it, you kinda just learn as you go. Management doesn't want to handle anything they just tell you to focus on your job. They choose someone without skills to be promoted rather than the person who has been there longer and knows everything. Benefits are worth it and some of the customers know how to make your day."
good,"I've learned a lot about customer service, to have high expectations of the quality of my work as well as others. I worked in a team environment and unloaded freight using pallets jacks as well as used a cardboard bailer to bail recyclables. Most enjoyable part of my job is one interacting with customers, the hours of which I work, and the off days are a plus."
good,"Company is safe, not going anywhere, tons of locations so there is advancement opportunities. Publix I feel has gotten away from the core values they once had for customer service and is more about penny pinching now."
good,Excellent company to work for. They have a great benefits package. It's a fun place to work with opportunity for advancement in all departments.
good,"I began as a cashier 1 1/2 years ago and within that time received pay raises to the top of my current job rating as Meals Clerk. I also received ""role model' evaluations every time - unheard of in Publix. I enjoyed interacting with the customers and up-selling the products I demonstrated, but the hardest part was the physical labor involved in cleaning to Health Department standards, emptying the sink at my station ( 60lbs.) and stocking my display case."
good,Great place to work. Customer service is excellent. I learned so much from my management. pay wasn't very high at all but it was forty hours a week.
good,It was a great place to work. Customers were great and employees were even greater. I just wish it paid more for what you have to do in the job description.
good,Everyday was repetitive but one thing that remained constant was the emphasis on customer service and cleanliness. We all had to work as a team to complete every task day in and day out. Punctuality was also a huge part of the job. The hardest part was to ensure the customer left happy and to remember the customer is always right. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and even becoming friends with customers who came in daily.
good,for the most part while working at publix there were times when you could say you actually enjoyed every minute of your work. most days were fun and great
good,"Working at Publix made me a strong by training me as a customer service representative that knows how to handle most situations when a customer is unsatisfied or just needs direction to what they are looking for. The management always watched over us, making sure everything was running smooth throughout all the registers and co-workers. Advancement in this industry and keeping steady hours is very difficult to do even with experience. This was my first job so it did teach me everything I use in the job force today."
good,"A typical day at work includes, bagging and cashiering costumers, by providing premier costumer service while being reliable and responsible. Management stands beside their associates, providing advice and support. Co-workers are great influences and friends, making them the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Publix has been great to work since it allows me to work with a flexible schedule.
good,"There's always something to do and I like interacting with people. I learned that it is always to best to smile in all situations, because getting mad or upset only makes a problem worst. However, a simple smile or your kindness could turn a bad situation into a lifelong return customer who tells another guest to visit our establish-ment. The hardest part of the job is not being able please everyone, but you must always strive to do so. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the little 'ol lady says to the staff that ,""I have not been treated like royalty ever at any store like I do here and I thank you all for being one of God's true angels here on earth!"
good,great place to work
good,Really liked this job but they do not pay enough though. With the pay it is intended for high school students as a part time job.
good,"I learned alot from previous bakers. I learned how to work quick and efficient. There are days when you have alot of cake orders to do, but still have to make sure the floor is filled with bakery items for customers to buy. It's alot of work, but when you are a dedicated work you make the impossible possible."
good,"Using a head set, a computer tells you where and what product to pick. Good stacking is key so that product is not damage. Work environment is very relaxed."
good,Very productive and fast pace. I learned to be more tolerant with this job. Management are available when needed and respectful. My co-workers are friendly and easy to work with.
good,I liked working here helping the patients anyway and it wasn't my job but I didn't mind I love talking and laughing with them for there families didn't come every day I've heard so many of there stories for many of the nurses were nasty though and as some of my co workers were as well but I loved the place
good,"Publix is one of the best jobs a teenager could ask for, if you have a busy or fluctuating Schedule they usually have no problem working with you, the uniforms are great because you don't have to worry about what to wear but there a little restricting in your movement. you do have to understand if your not there for the long run to make it a career it can be a childish place to work, lots of gossip. As for moving up in the company, expect to work long hard hours cause they will put you through it."
good,"great benefits if you get enough hours at a part time position. pofit share plans, bonuses, regualar raises. managers can good or bad. but a solid company overall with good values."
good,I was in charge of all daily accounting procedures. My co-workers were nice but the managers were very lazy and would not assume responsibility for their mistakes.
good,"If you want to make good and easy money, and work for a company that most likely will never go out of business, work for publix. You can do anything and everything if you are willing to learn and work hard to become someone."
good,"if you want great customer service, shop at publix. the associates and managers there are wonderful people. one of the rare places i see the managers doing the same job as the associates when it gets really busy. the associates there will help you with all your needs."
good,A typical day at work began with promptly entering the workplace and assisting customers with their needs. The constant interaction with customers helped improve my communication skills and made me a more efficient employee. The managers were effective in assisting me and my other co-workers in completing daily duties. The most challenging part of the job was trying to find a specific item when the customer was exactly sure what they needed but it was always enjoyable to see a the satisfied smile on their face when all needs have been achieved.
good,"As far as compensation, a good place to work for. Typical work day is long and dealing with customers. Worst part is long hours and working a lot. Most enjoyable is going home."
good,"Good overall place to work and good work life balance, nice management"
good,"As an associate in the Publix organization for 4 years, I would have to say that Publix has been nothing short of a great employer offering a good amount of benefits and opportunities for anyone willing to work hard towards them."
good,Its a great place to work there but they tend to misjudge and accuse there associates and take forever to finish peoples training.
good,"As cashiers, we had to promote and deliver premiere customer service to all customers, to make their experience with us remarkable, every time. It is an amazing company to be a part of."
good,Publix was the first job that I ever had so it will always have a good place in my heart. I learned a lot of customer service skills while I was at Publix. I also learned a lot about of produce while I was in the produce department
good,"The job provides very good job security and is definitely worth your time. If you have a low attention span and or like energized this job is not for you as its fairly ""boring"" but it definitely pays the bills and never fails to produce a healthy work environment."
good,Not enough hours but they are working on learning other areas of company to be able to get more experiences in areas interested.  Management try to help out most times and is positive with any type of questions or concerns that I have.  I would like to learn as much as possible so I can improve myself.
good,"My first initial thought when I was hired at Publix was that I was working for a grocery store. However, after working there for 3+ years now, I have come to realize they are so much more than a grocery store; they are a family to both the staff and the customer."
good,"You really learn a lot there! Everyone wants to help you! Managers were absolutely wonderful, showing in various ways that we matter within the company! Customers were nice always appreciated us for the hard work we did, through everything! Great place to work! 😁"
good,Friendly work environment with a great management team. They value employees as much they value customers. There are lot of benefits for the employees
good,Started as a Front Service Clerk and moved my way up to Cashier and then Customer Service. The training I received was great up until CS when problems arose with time and I was later blamed for it. I did well in my job before I was informed that I could be doing more by greeting EVERY customer that walks in the door (despite helping a current customer) and dropped back down to Cashier with an offer to move to seafood (one of the guys there left and I believe they just wanted to fill the slot since I was reliable). Not all the managers were bad (a few were great) but enough at my store weren't truly looking out for you.
good,Enjoyed working for Publix. The flexible schedule was really good for my part time position. Truly enjoyed working with my manager and other co workers. Everyone was willing to help me when I needed
good,"I have been working for this company a total of fourteen years and in my case, the hardest part of the job is waiting for advancement and growth in the company."
good,This is my second time with Publix.  Overall it is a great company to work for.  I have been back full time for just over 6 months and already have vacation time.
good,It's a hard job but i love working in i make my work done and i go to work on time making sure everything done  i think this is the job for a man to work
good,"This job is overall good. I do wish they would pay more attention to employees, but overall it is a swell job. I do believe the pay rate from department to department is not ideal."
good,"load and unload truck, helping customer in whatever they need, greek people all the time, stocking the shelfs and organizing the correctly, keeping a good relationship with my supervisor and my employees."
good,"My work experience would say a rollercoaster. Up and downs, but willing to give another try after some time away. And hopefully things will go better when I return."
good,"Publix is a great place to work if you like retail. Great benefits, coworkers, and clean environment. The downside is it's demanding, crazy work hours, and no consistent schedule."
good,Good company that needs to focus on giving pharmacy operations more hours at pharmacy level to our technicians and pharmacists.  I would like to see publix add increased help in the pharmacy to better help us help patients in a timely and professional manner.
good,"The people there are amazing to work for and they will work with you on finding the right schedule. The problem is, the amount of employees they have doesn’t allow them to give everyone the hours they deserve"
good,I actually loved working at publix it was a friendly environment everyone treated each other like family and we made it through the day together only downside is people call off a lot and you’ll be understaff most days
good,Publix is a great company to work for and has great benefits. My only complaint is that sometimes the managers can be cruel and do not have a sense of the employees' feelings.
good,I enjoyed Publix a lot I just felt a little stuck and it had nothing to do with the company or management. Overall Publix is a great place to work and I recommend it to anyone in high school or college.
good,"Customer Service"
good,"changing hours"
good,"Just like any other place, there is favoritism in the work place. The store manager who is retired now, made my job more difficult. They teamed me up with a manager that I never got along with."
good,They are okay job but not if you need to work. They love to cut hour and have be on call for them. They claim to be about customers and they are not. Hmm
good,Professional environment that continues to grow and expand support functions for retail pharmacies. Management is excellent in overseeing the potential for growth in every individual associate. Quarterly meetings are held within departments to share ideas for improvement.
good,After working in a handful of Publix's it's obvious that the employees take the opportunity to make the store their own and each store has its own culture.
good,"I used to work as I want,fast when I can and so on. I loved my job I’ve been train to do the job. As selector, motor operator, battery man, sanitation..."
good,"I would typically bag groceries, push carts, and assist customers taking their groceries to their vehicles. The hardest part of the job was the carts because you are outside constantly with whatever weather it is."
good,"things have change at Publix as far as the way they treat their employees. They are more corporate run like Universal, "
good,Great company with awesome benefits employees are team players. Managers are really lacking knowledge of the brand. Company gives you stock based on the years you've been employed.
good,Publix is a great company that takes care of its employees and customers. They hire many different people and offer completive pay with unlimited growing potential.
good,"Responsible for managing all cashiers of the front-end, hiring and scheduling of employees, handling and resolving customer complaints, and keeping inventory at effective level."
good,I have been working for Publix in the Deli for about two months now and absolutely love it. Management is awesome and extremely helpful with explaining and teaching.
good,"Work environment is friendly, management support is excellent, great company with potential of long term growth if you are willing, benefits start after 6 months of hire"
good,Publix is very customer friendly and cares for their associates. They strive for the highest satisfaction. They give back to the community. They offer great benefits to both their associates and families and its customers.
good,Publix is a great friendly environment that welcomes everyone to call it home. My experience with Publix was amazing. Unfortunately some communication was missed so I got fired.
good,A typical day at publix tends to be busy very fast pace especially as A grocery clerk. you will have many customers ask you questions try your best to answer them or get help.
good,"Great benefits good place to work for beginner workers/students teaches you customer service and self development. Also how to manage time, there are extra things they make you do whether it’s sweep the sidewalk of leaves or clean the outside windows of the door or above windows. Pay is good to sustain a life for yourself but not as much for a family house hold unless you get full time and not part time with part time you can have a good week one week and a 10 hour week the next."
good,It’s a fast paced yet calm job. It really depends on the day and time. overall the job is not much of a challenge and pays well. It’s hard to get into but as great benefits overall.
good,"Publix has a pretty good culture. It can feel a bit like a cult at times, where people that have never worked anywhere else believe it is perfect, but overall they do treat people decently. Compensation could be a bit better, they rely heavily on their employee stock plan to try and make up for it. You'll hear lots of stories about millionaire grocery stockers who got in early, but extra pay would help in the short term."
good,Publix was a great starting job it had a friendly atmosphere and all the people that I worked with were knowledgeable and helped me get a good standing with the company
good,Working at Publix's teach you what's really customer service and how fast you have to be. its a competitive atmosphere but with full of benefits the longer you work there. Once you learn something in here you'll have it for life.
good,It’s great for anyone who doesn’t have to support a family or have children. The schedules are rotating third shift to 2nd to first and then a day off. Hard week. But if I didn’t have the kids that I actually need to spend more time with during the week I wouldn’t be looking elsewhere.
good,A typical day at work some day or long and some or short . I have learn not to rush and be patient. Management is is great. Every culture works there. The hardest part about job is having to find why the cash office be short and u can't leave until you find out what's wrong. The most enjoyable part is working with the customers and helping customers.
good,"I love working at Publix I work hard and I do my job to the fullest , they just don’t give enough hours like one week I’ll have 30/33 next week I have 10/20 hours and I just can’t live off that not knowing if I’m going to be able to pay my bliss on time etc. I just need something thats more consistent with hours ."
good,"Publix is very flexible if you attend college and willing to work around your schedule. They are very understanding, willing to help, and communicate with you at any moment."
good,They are a great business to work for good customer service and they have great price and deals also great benefits if you work with them and is safe.
good,"Working here is an honor. I come to work ready to see what the day offers, and am proud of my duty to provide premier customer service. It can be very challenging, but hard work pays off most days."
good,"If you do your job , you will be noticed. If you don't you will be noticed and the other people your also do your job will be reminded of that because of you and your excuses."
good,I enjoyed my time there. It was a community minded company that took care of the neighborhood.  I really liked working for them but I got sick and had to resign.
good,You are constantly juggling many things in management and the pressure to perform can be very high. The job at times seems to wear you down but can also be incredibly rewarding. Pay and benefits are great for the most part considering the industry. Work life balance takes careful planning sometimes if you want to see your loved ones. it is a 45 to 50+ hour work week at all hours of the day and business obviously ramps up around the holidays. I do not believe you will find a better company within this industry.
good,"The management was great overall at least for front service clerks. However the Starbucks kiosk was not paid attention to and was not well managed at all. If you are going to work there to be a front service clerk or cashier, I guarantee you will have no problems with management. It can get boring however. I solved this by interacting and talking with customers. Overall, it wasn't a terrible job, it just wasn't for me."
good,Great place to work for teenagers in high school.   They work with your availability schedule and are understanding if you are involved in sports or other extracurricular activities

good,It’s very fast pace so you have to learn to constantly be on the move and not get stressed . Very customer friendly so you have to have a nice attitude towards customers. Always have a smile
good,Hard to find good dependable workers which puts more stress on management. Overall a good company culture all promoted from within. Not a great work life balance which is expected with retail. The pay and bonuses for managers was great.
good,"Great place to work if in the perfect situation with the management above you. Some corporate and management choices are often questionable and lack basic common sense in how they affect daily store activities, but other than that the job is enjoyable with good pay and benefits."
good,"Is a good retail company to work with, reasonable pay and schedule as your requested, manager are supportive (depend on store, of course). Even though there are some non-respected colleagues."
good,A very fast paced work environment. The usual hustle and bustle of a retail location. Fairly easy to move up assuming you're in a profitable store. The hardest part of the job was the hours. Gives you very limited family time.
good,It’s a great company. You get great benefits the only down side is management. You have some management that are amazing! But then you have a few managers that are  absolutely horrible no morals   Integrity Or respect for the company or anyone they  encounter .
good,"Publix was one of the best companies that I have worked for. Such a great, supportive environment. Managers and employees are kind to each other and work well together."
good,"It was a great place to work at, with great employees. It was like working with family, I very much enjoyed my time working there and the people that worked there with me."
good,I think it was a pretty good first job. I think it’s very friendly atmosphere. I think the people are really helpful. The managers were cool and I wouldn’t mind working there again.
good,"Working for Publix while persuing any degree is very beneficial. You dictate when you can work through choosing the hours you are available to work. While people are great to work with, the management staff needs improvement of employee relations and communication."
good,"I loved working at my job but it seemed that management lied to me when I was first hired about the potential in advancement. Every single time there was a need, instead of promoting someone who had undergone the training for the position, was already doing the work and was doing a good job at it, they would bring in someone new who from another store or someone brand-new to the job to do it. "
good,"I am very grateful with Publix, is a great company with good management and great people. i learned a lot and that the reason i am leaving because i want to do something else in my life."
good,"Everyone there wants you to succeed and is more than willing to lend a hand when needed. You are constantly supplied with pamphlets and coupons about benefits and discounts you're eligible for. The friendliest work environment I've worked in and possibly the most tolerable form of retail. The most enjoyable part of the job is how willing everyone is to help each other which is dire when facing the daily curve balls in customer service. Provides detailed evaluations every 90 days with plenty of opportunities to advance within the company. If you put in hard work, you will be rewarded."
good,Day would begin by checking posted schedule to identify work duties for the day and then clock in to begin daily tasks. Assigned breaks would be taken and work resumed. Managers my ask to stay past posted duration of shift if the need arose.
good,Working at Publix was very different.People were very friendly and very understanding. Publix was always very busy and always clean.Made it easy to work. The hardest part about working there was trying to always be my best.I always wanted to make things be great so that things could always run smooth.The most enjoyable part of working there wouldhave to be the people and being able to come to work everyday with great energy.
good,"I make platters, do prep. I also engage with customers if the have needs for the many other services we provide. I love the job I dont intend to leave I am just trying to get a second occupation."
good,A good place to work. Learned a lot about customer service. I learned about the responsibilites of showing up on time and what not. This was my first REAL job and I recommend it to any teen.
good,Publix Supermarkets has been a great place to be employed. I am using my customer service skills daily and having to collaborate with coworkers to enhance my roll as a team player. The management has been consistent and helpful throughout all my years working for this company.
good,Starting out I knew the basics of the pharmacy operation. I gained the knowledge of inventory; the receiving and shipping. With Publix I was more hands on with the customers than with any other business allowing me to be more interacting with them.

good,"A great place to work and has incredible stock options for employees."
good,"Seasonal position, not enough time to learn all pisition the job reguire. Shift daily , not enough hours due to hiring several part timers,good atmosphere customers friendly.I like working there because of weekly pay. Able to balance household budget better with weekly pay then with bi-weekly pay."
good,Pleasant work environment due to good management and clientele.  Enjoyed the various opportunities given and encouraged to partake in such as store openings and doing store tours for kindergartners.  Many outlets to volunteer through as well.  Wages were my biggest discrepancy due to difficulty making a living and slow progression towards a reasonable pay raise
good,"Very good customer first environment/ culture"
good,It was great I like how the test assmemnet was and how they were gauging our skills to see if we qualified and I also like how they were seeing where our customers services skills were
good,"Publix was a nice place to work for me. I worked my way up to become a manager and it was not easy, but it was worth it. I met some awesome people over the years."
good,The people are nice. No one is full time. They have great benefits including getting a car where they take weekly payments out of your check. Ability to make overtime is there

good,"Good place to for retail work, great benefits. Professional place to work outstanding customer service. The staff is caring and friendly as well, they make sure as an employee you are great."
good,"Overall, I think Publix was a good first job but after a year and a half of working as a front service clerk, the job really began to bore me. I did not like doing the same exact thing every day and standing in one spot for hours at a time. The management was very understanding of my student lifestyle and helped me work with a limited schedule. My co-workers were very friendly and provided a family like atmosphere."
good,"can get very stressful around holidays, limited amount of people in the departments so we are very busy and have to work very hard to keep everything afloat"
good,"Publix is one of the most customer based companies out there. However, they care for their employees just as much, with great benefits and room to grow, it is one of the best in the business."
good,"Flexible work schedule helps with homework management. Good collaborative environment when working with fellow associates. However, employee discounts would be much appreciated."
good,"Easy to make friends, friendliest people, good managers. A typical day at work would include preforming duties of a front end clerk, such as bagging groceries, socializing with customers, and providing assistance to customers if they accepted the help outside. This experience taught me what a real job is like, seeing that it was my first job. Publix was a very friendly environment. The main goal was to make the customer happy and satisfied with their experience. The hardest part of the job was pushing carts, but I enjoyed seeing my coworkers everyday."
good,"I like working here, the people are nice. The pay is good but at first they don't give you a lot of hours. The managers are nice and they help you with anything you need and the customer service is great."
good,"Benefits are good and flexible hours, long breaks, raises every six months depending on performance, holidays stores aren’t opened, good way to start off"
good,Publix is a good company and was voted one of the top companies to work for in America. It's a Florida based company that prides itself in excellent customer service and providing high quality products throughout the store. I'm a cake decorator in the bakery. Really enjoy my job and love my manager.
good,This job is great for high school students or teenagers starting their first job. The hiring age starts at 14 and you can receive promotions in the company as you get older.

good,I would recommend this job for anyone looking for entry level or just want a good place to have a career at. It laid back at time but can sometimes be face paced and benefits are good.
good,While working at publix I meet a few great people who made working fun and product and swift. We laughed and had fun with the customers all while getting the job done.
good,"I worked for Publix in Smyrna just outside Atlanta. I was a part-time cashier but was scheduled around 38 hours per week. I enjoyed my job as a cashier very much. The training is good and if you are someone who enjoys being helpful and lending a hand to help out not only the customer but also fellow co-workers then you will be very happy at Publix. The hourly rate was low in my opinion, but despite that I loved working there. I only left when my spouse's job took us west."
good,It is a great place to work and offers a lot of chances to move up in the business! They were very flexible with hours and always allowed me to take time off when I needed it for school and my  studies.
good,"Good environment to work at, you meet new people and get to know your costumers. I work at a busy store, Time flies by. Schedule are flexible to work with."
good,They are flexible with hours. Stock is a major plus. Friendly environment. Great reputation for customer service. Quality products. The only down side is some locations such as Helena are harder for people of color to work there because they can be racist at times. The customers and the staff members can be racist. Helena is a small town and are not very diverse. Other than that I enjoy working for the company.
good,Days are mix of busy and slow. Good chance for career advancement if you want it. All management are promoted from within. I enjoy meeting new people and talking with repeat customers.
good,"All in all, Publix was a good place to work. I don't have any beef with them. They helped me with what I required. Everyday wasn't peaches and cream, but thank God for a job. Publix gave me a chance to retire (short-term). How can I complain?"
good,provide customer service while cashiering and making sure all the customers leave satisfied. Handle money and computer and make sure I maintain a neat and proper work space.
good,"Publix was my first job with a regular paycheck.  I started as a bagger and left as a cashier.  Most coworkers either just went through the motions or were a little too dedicated.  It's a good place to work in general.  You receive regular training , and so long as you're able to be sociable to customers and play nice with the rest of the store, you'll be fine.  If you're short for hours, you can always work across departments."
good,"I spent 6 years working for Publix. Through my time there I had great relationships with many of my co-workers and customers. They were very flexible with my school schedule and was able to provide me with near full time hours to help me pay for school. The management was great, however Management did rotate quite frequently. In my 6 years I had 6 different managers. Overall, I had a great experience working at Publix and encourage anyone who is looking for employment throughout school to apply here."
good,They take care of their employees and the interview process is quick. Their management is good. They do a swell job of making sure you understand the concept and task before they put you on the floor.
good,I liked working at Publix but I needed a full time job so I had to go also I was not put in the position that I applied for. Was told I would be moved and never was
good,"It is a good place to start working,also you have some good benefits,401k,retirement plan,the can help you with school,they help a lot of people after the urican irma."
good,Very good company to work for. Very good management and other people as other like the reviews. I dont want to do review for free in this applications
good,"i stocked for a few month there my manager was really cool and laid back as long as i did my job of course, its a good first job that actually has some career opportunities if your willing to put some years in. lots of room for growth."
good,"Publix is a pretty good place to work if your into retail.  They are really good with advancement in certain areas.  Benefits and pay are great as well as holiday bonuses.  I would recommend Publix, it was a really goods stepping stone for me getting into the workplace.  For the most part the company itself takes really good care of their employees financially."
good,"Publix places a big importance on the customer. The level of customer service this company expects is really high, a culture that I became a part of very quickly and a place where my foundation as a customer service employee expanded."
good,I learned the value of treating the customer like royalty. Encourages doing the job with integrity and excellent time management by implementing company wide policies. The company has an open door policy and offers employees stock options.
good,I had great time working here. Great management. I got along well with my coworkers. My managers were always supportive. They gave good feedback that helped you be better
good,"Publix strives to promote from within which makes the culture easy to promote as managers are well versed with Publix’s mission statement. Publix provides ample opportunity to advance within Publix, and provides avenues for potential growth outside of the Publix umbrella."
good,"The workplace culture is very friendly. If you're a right fit for the company, they will groom you, for advancement. Id say find your desired department fast, so you do not waste time."
good,I enjoyed working there and the customers are nice sometimes. My co-workers was nice and i got aong with everybody. The manager as kind and nice to evrybody.
good,It is hard being a college student and not making enough money to live on my own. This job has helped me a lot but just need more to survive. Thank you
good,First you got your cash drawer. You counted it to make sure it wsa correct. Then you went to your cash register and waited on customers. Very enjoyable
good,Lots of chances to move up. Good place to work. Good pay and nice people. Alwaya busy and always learning something new. Would definitely go back. Great subs.lol
good,"I found the employment fast paced and rewarding and would recommend publix as an employer to anyone seeking employment."
good,Publix is an amazing company. It’s somewhere you can move up and go far with. It’s usually relaxed and your time goes by fast because you are always doing something but it’s never too overwhelming. The managers treat you with respect and is overall a very nice company.  My only complaint is the lack or hours with part time.
good,Small store always clean and neat but staff sometimes are rude. Small breakroom and no discounts have to pay full price on everything short breaks and way too much work not apart of what workers are assigned to.
good,i did not work for Publix Supermarkets. I worked for Publix Employees Credit Union it was the associates of Publix personal bank. You had to work for Publix to be a member.
good,Great place for a young person to start and advance up to management. Flexible hours for going to school to advance my career and life. Management is great.
good,This job always keeps you on your toes. There really isn't a time to slack off. This is because of the managers mostly. The hardest part of the job is the customer service because you always have to smile.
good,The only bad thing I can truly say about Publix is the fact that everyone starts off as part-time and it takes years to get to full-time. Starting part-time allows them to give you hours that work for their budget. For instance they can have an employee work 10 hours one week and 35 hours the next which does not allow a person to have a consistent cash flow.
good,I really enjoyed working at this location. I was lucky enough to work with great people. Most of the customers were wonderful and thankful for the hard work we put into caring for them.
good,i need full time have to beat out everyone else .                       it wasnt a fair system how they judge people . if you not opening you never get r=trained .
good,Its a good place if you either just need a job or if you are looking for a place to start a career. You take care of them and they will definitely take care of you.
good,"very nice place to work, different cultures, possibility of growing very fast if you put effort in you work, the managers that i have worked excellent, worked at par with you, very good benefits and guarantees your retirement when it is time to retire"
good,This was an excellent place to work would love to go back to the company  They offer excellent benefits great supervisors Opportunities for advancement are present Offer the ability to learn new things about where housework
good,"Fast paced environment, focused on customer service.  Good leadership and management.  Hardest part of the job was training in the frozen food section.  The most enjoyable part of the job was customer interaction."
good,Customer service is a high priority for Publix in every department. Helping customers is the best part of my job!  Over the years I have learned the benefit of customer satisfaction!  Management is always helpful to achieve our goals.
good,I liked working there. It's a place that have great benefits. The people that work there are nice also the managers. It's a great place to start working if your still in school or retired or just want to make money.
good,"Publix is a very stable and growing grocery chain with very thorough training, eager to promote from within the company and  within individual stores. Being at retirement age, I was happy to have part time work and the actual benefits of optional employee owned stock. "
good,"fun place to work, everyone is great, easy days, hours are good, benefits, stock options, days off and holidays good times are had by all and everyone gets along"
good,"It was a great job!! But the hours are limited,it was slow pace?the management wasn’t consistent. Publix is a great job but for a teenage base platform not for an adult with bills."
good,"I worked at Publix while I was finishing college. I knew that it was not going to be my career for the rest of my life, but it was a good job to get me through school."
good,"Enjoyable place to work. Everyone helped each other out. We all took pride in the trays we made. Management was not afraid to jump in and help with anything that need done,"
good,If your in high school and looking for a job then look up Publix. Publix has very good benefits and are willing to help their employees with finding time in the schedule
good,"Publix was a great place to work. I  enjoyed giving premier customer service. It is like a family, which was awesome.raise opportunities every six months with good evaluations and all employees can buy stock."
good,This position also was a learning tool to get to know the company I was working for. Ultimately I was able to learn the basics and become a quick asset.
good,Nice place to work competitive hours decent wages a fair management staff good team work available hours for those who are willing to work friendly environment
good,Well organized very good store to work with and lots of benefits to talking with customers everyday just about ordinary things. everyday usually sluggish because of location.
good,"It is a great company to work for. However, they don't schedule many hours to part time workers. If they give part time work more than 10 hours a week than it will be worth staying."
good,"Great culture, diverse associates. Strive to be the best in retail services. Great for encouraging self development and lots of training. Great open door polic."
good,"The work environment varies from store to store as different management takes different approaches to tasks. Overall, the job culture is very evident and alive company wide. The pay scales for different positions seems random and unfair. Although Publix is a great company to work for with admirable benefits, working retail demands a great deal from associates both physically and mentally."
good,Publix has a great workplace culture with friendly people who are determined to delver great customer service and products. A typical day goes by fast as you are constantly completing task. The management is great overall and I am surrounded by people I like working with. The most enjoyable part includes that hard work pays off and management always recognizes your hard work. The hardest part of the job seems to be the inconsistent hours managers have to work. Overall it is a great company to work for.
good,Working at publix my work would depend on what I was scheduled for that day. A larger percentage was cleaning and working closing shifts which would include waiting on customers and make sure the shelves were properly stocked.
good,"Depending on the managers it could be a great place to work. You can't be afraid to speak your mind, when you need or want something. It has very flexible hours for college students, and very good hours when you need them if your a great worker! I have been here almost a year and it has been a good experience there is always room for growth and raises are every few months and year. Very great company, there could be some adjustments like any other company it can have it's ups and downs. But as a student it's a perfect place to work, and you get holidays off, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter, etc. Make sure when you fill out your application only put the department you really want to work in. Grocery department depending on location can be very full of hours and occasionally late nights. You can always change departments depending on your manager. Great company for those who don't mind occasionally working retail or cashier and customer service. Always room for advancement here!"
good,was a great job for that time period in my life. publix pays off if you work there for a long time. they take care of benefits for a lot of their employees
good,It is very hard to get over time. Some managers are wonderful. The expect a lot in a short amount of time you have to learn to pick up your speed to get the job done.
good,"The store I worked at was slow most days with the occasional spurt of crowds here and there. There was was an apparent lack of communication, but working there wasn't the worst thing in the world."
good,The workers are pleasant most of the time but can be catty and resemble high school. It's a nice place to work other than that. You learn a lot of how to help customers.
good,"I work in the deli department. I prepare food for clients, and I quietly perform my job. Most people here are laid back and get their work done so we can come home to our families."
good,Publix was a nice place to work the store was very clean and the people were nice. The work environment was friendly and everyone helped each other out with things.
good,"Great culture and training programs. Unfavorable upper management making pharmacy decisions. Allowed for certain training to expand duties. Helped other stores with work load balance when free time was available. Established strong patient relationships as well as practitioner relationships with collaborative care programs and via CLIA certification, immunizations, and MTM programs. Offered Pharmacogenomics training to other stores."
good,"Great Company, unfortunately, I live too far, the hardest part of my job is the driving, in my case, I enjoyed the opportunity and all that I've been learn in this huge company."
good,"Work in a fast paced work environment, Adapted to a changing work environment as every day learning new things. Worked well as a team member with fellow co workers. Assisted  with a variety of customers with different needs.Assisted with duties that needed to be completed by deadlines. Enjoyed the environment and learning new things."
good,"This job will keep you on your toes. Every shift is something different, but that greatly depends on the store you work in. The hours are flexible until you get to summer when hours become hard to find."
good,"Customers are usually very demanding and dull and the employees dont help just make you feel dumb. When i was new, the employees wouldnt talk to me and only the manager did and she was very rude,"
good,I enjoyed working at Publix but I was not getting enough hours and the supervisors were not understanding the needs of the associates. Some people were not properly trained and managers would on give you 20-25 hours a week and that is not allot to live off of.
good,Publix is a great place to work. You have an opportunity to advance if you take advantage of it. Publix gives you free food and the associates are nice and welcoming.
good,"Great company to work for! Fast paced and friendly environment. Career advancement, paid vacation! Friendly people who pride themselves on customer service e being top priority!"
good,I have only worked Part-time at Public since May 2017 so I am not totally adept with all the companies polices and procedures.  I basically only work for approximately 2 to 3 days per week.
good,"Great place to start building experience with customer service along with other custodial duties. A typical day involves communicating with customers either on the register, on the isles, or within any other department. Shopping cart management is nearly half of the labor done at Publix. Some managers are friendly and happy to talk to you while others may be more stern and stubborn. There are many young workers ages 16-25 and older workers that are mostly over 50. The hardest part of the job is usually dealing with difficult customers who might get offended or who weren't contempt with the services we provide at publix. The most enjoyable part is being able to walk around the entire store and even the parking lot all while still being on duty. Every where you go, there is always something to do."
good,I am a full time student who is also completing training for a future job in law enforcement. I enjoyed Publix for the short time I was there. However I put I was available for 20-21 hours a week and that was fine for about two weeks then all the sudden they scheduled me for 36 hours which I didn’t have the time for all night shifts. They wouldn’t budge on the schedule so I had to sadly resign.
good,It a pleasure working for Publix it’s a friendly family type of business everything is done in the perfect order and customer satisfaction is the key.
good,Publix has great management and benefits for all employees. Publix job culture was very organized and detailed. Due to relocation I parted ways but the company is great
good,A typical day at Publix would be fast-paced and fun. Working here I have learned how to deal with nearly every situation when it comes to customer service.
good,I find this job to be fair. I learned that everyone works together. Management is good. The employees get along good. The hardest part was getting used to being up so late. The most enjoyable part was making the customer feel welconme
good,Management was very fair in every way possible. They always worked with me any time that I needed them to. The job was always pedal to the metal every day. I learned how to drive a forklift very well.
good,Excellent stock and health benefits. The opportunity to advance is great.  The company will provide you with flexible hours if you are student or pursuing another career.
good,publix is a great company and you could easily make it into a career if you wanted to. they treat all their employees well and they also like to hire with in.
good,Publix is a great company to work for long term job. It has great benefits and you can move up quickly if you work hard. I didn’t like my coworkers to much and customers were annoying but other than that pretty good place to work.
good,Great company to work towards a healthy retirement if you are willing to be underpaid until you are promoted to management.  Most co-workers are personable and friendly.
good,good place to work bonuses and other incentives and i was a pretty cool place to work and i would love to work back their again but for more money a hour and full time
good,mindless brutal work great pay if u have no skill but want to get paid like a docotor hot cold it pays you eat work hard play hard thats all i got to say about that
good,Very chill but productive as well. I learned how to give great customer service. Management is ok. Publix is a ok place to work. The hardest part is trying to satisfy the customers especially when they get upset and impatient. Making people smile and making sure they have a great day is the enjoyable part of the job.
good,"publix is a great company to work for in general, i worked as a part-time floater and traveled from perdido key to ft walton beach. any overnight travel or work for the weekend in a location over 50 miles i had hotel and food allowance coverage which was a great benefit for part-time."
good,"I really enjoy working at Publix.  It is a great place to work, and shop.  They really care about customer service and its employees.  Moving up is very hard."
good,"Advancement was fair but extremely slow. Got a shareholder check every month. Good managers, good co workers. The surroundings were always clean. Excellent products that sold them sevles."
good,"Great place to work, best customer service. I learned how to delegate and work efficiently within a group. Multitasking and planning was an important aspect of the job."
good,"Publix is a great place to work if you like the rigors of retail.If you dont mind working weekends and holidays you cannot beat the benifts.If you find a crew that you work well with you will love it.There are many opportunities in this company.You can work in Tennessee,Alabama,North and South Carolina,Georgia and of course Florida.You can work in the warehouses,Corporate Offices,you can drive a truck,and any department in the stores.I had the best job in the store DSD clerk.I was responsible for everything that came in through the back door."
good,"working here has been a journey and a learning experience. working here will give you patience, endurance, and reason if you pay attention and care about your work."
good,able to get your job done in time. managers assist if need be. Working at publix changed my life. Great experience for me. I was able to work in an environment were i can help custermers and focus on my job.
good,"Part time - Great for high school and college student that live at home with parents and don't have a lot of bills to pay. A typical day at work, you come in your manger tells you your duties for the day complete those and you will be OK. Provide premier customer service while on the floor to the customers."
good,"this is a good place to work with excellent benefits, but the management is not always the best. When I started working for Publix, I was happy with how willing they are to work with students. However, it is a job that gets very boring and very tiring after a while."
good,"Very welcoming and cleanly environment. A perfect place to advance with your career. Good quality products and services. In addition, family oriented."
good,"A typical day of work consists of being micromanaged by your team leader or manager. If the work is not spread out evenly get ready to be assigned more work, especially if you are a fast worker. If someone calls out the whole team will suffer the consequence as the managers will not call anyone to come in."
good,"I have spent 20 years with Publix.  They offer competitive pay and benefits.  Hours are flexible but not guaranteed if you are part time.  I had to step down from full time to part time after my son was born due to lack if childcare options for infants.  I would like a career in an office environment with a more stable work schedule.  Would like to get away from working so many nights, weekends and holidays."
good,"its good, I learned how cashier  and bag. It was my first real job, they have pretty good management. I enjoyed how simple it was, the workplace was nice."
good,Excelente trabajo no me arrepiento de haber trabajado en esa empresa.
good,It's a great place to work. Anyone who works there will be happy. flexible hours and raise with every six month you are there. Publix is the place to be.
good,"Personally in the 3 yrs time I had with Publix l wouldn't have wanted to work anywhere else good people, premier customer service , diligent caring associate's that would give their right arm and more to see the customer was appreciated. Rarely had rude customer's and we always did our best to assist those around us while also providing excellent service."
good,Nothing horrendous to say. Easy to get along with the working environment. Flexibility and pay was comparable to most upscale retail establishments. Good job choice.
good,"publix is a good job , good people spirits , energy i love working customer are great . good food .  management on the other hand can get better . hard part of this job that some customers can be rude and that its okay ."
good,"Very fast passed, customers are very knowledgeable of the company and it's reputation. Which the customer service is top notch  the only negative is that the company does not promote based on background or experience. They are a promote from within company, which is not a bad thing, especially if you get in on the ground up, if this is your first job and stick with it. Five years from now you can be a Assistant Manager, earning a very nice salary for someone your age."
good,"Benefits are available for employees ,  as well as stock."
good,"My normal day consists of preparing prescriptions under the direct supervision of my pharmacist. I've learned about many new medications and interactions with other drugs, and I think that is has prepared me fully for a position in the Registered Nurse field."
good,Publix was a really nice company. I didn't really expect it and i honestly never even heard of a Publix until I moved there. It was a knew experience. Their rules were different also.
good,"This place is good for the average person. You won't be buying any mansions, but maybe a Cadillac. Possibly 2 if you're management. The hours are great and management is usually willing to work with you to make the perfect schedule for you. It can be demanding at times, but is rarely overwhelming (depending on the location)."
good,"i learned how to stock groceries.use a cash register,and bake cakes.My workplace was very fun and entertaining.I really enjoyed interacting with the people."
good,I liked working there for the first few months. Then they stopped working me as much and would put me down for the days I couldn't even work on. Didn't get any benefits while working there.
good,If your not able to keep up you will surely get caught behind . Always work that needs to be done and always something to clean. Overalll great environmental growth within the company
good,Doesn't hire help as fast as we need it so we were always behind. Communication isn't always there with managers. No specific training for new hires so employees have to train while trying to do their own work.
good,The associates there are friendly and easy to talk to. The managers are also easy to talk to. The customers are fun and the company also strives to accomplish a certain goal they set.
good,I mean I don’t really like or it’s this store that I don’t like it’s really the people here they are all in there feelings most of the time. People here Are spoiled
good,"Publix is a fantastic place to work. "
good,"Depending on your department, you're expected to function as an adult and one thing remains, customer first!"
good,"It's a priviledge for me to work with this company, very good atmosphere it's create lot of opportunity if you wanna continue pursuing  a career with publix?"
good,"I wish I would have been in a different circumstance, I would have made a career out of it ... excellent company to work for , if you are willing to be the best you can be."
good,"Publix was a good place to work, the culture was good there the people were nice and the managers were interested in see the workers advance and make sure they are doing well."
good,This is a good place to work at. They give you decent pay and promote from within so if you are looking for a long term career this is the place for you
good,there is a lot to do and few people in the department to do all the work. Co-workers call out often with little consequences leaving us the work load. i wanted to move up the ladder but my manager did not have the time to train me.
good,"Overall I love working at Publix, it’s a great place to work with all types of different people and meet all types of customers every day. I love working with money too and in Custoner Service that is the main thing you deal with plus customers. The only issue is all managers aren’t the same and every year or two you’ll get new managers. Some don’t see your point of view the same as others and aren’t as empathetic or rewarding to how great you are at your job. Overall I would recommend the job to someone else just hope you have managers who want to help you."
good,"I enjoyed working for Publix"
good,"It is a great place to work everyone is friendly,treat each other as if family in the work place there are no arguments or anger the only anger that comes in the store is a customer and the is rarely"
good,"The job is great, sometimes its a little difficult. Everybody is nice."
good,"If you want a great starting job, this place is the right place. The hours are the most flexible I’ve seen, you get any days off you ask for, and it’s mostly a stress free work place for most part"
good,"It was OK working there for the first few months. I learned how to communicate with elders better and also how to take my time with them. My manager was sweetie at times but also hard, but that's a manager for you."
good,"good place to work, work your but off and hopefully you will get noticed 's cold and you never know how many numbers you might have to do or how long your going to be there. A lot of people are rude that already been working there for years."
good,"After 1000 hours publix gives part time and full time benefits from health, vision, and dental. You also because part owner of publix with a stock. It’s a family culture environment."
good,Publix is a nice place to work if you are looking for flexible hours and they people are nice. If you are looking for part-time work at a grocery store there is no better option.
good,I liked working at publix everyone was very nice and upbeat the hours were flexible and fast paced and the deli always had good food management was good.
good,Miss working there a lot meet a lot of great people from everywhere very nice customer very fast pace of working love the holiday season great benefits paid holidays
good,"I loved working for Publix , All mangers was easy going and easy to get along with. They will help with any circumstances and will also teach you on any thing your lacking on ."
good,"Publix is a great company to work for mainly for the benefits you'll receive, stocks affordable medical and dental. the also have a publix employee credit union that can help with car or housing purchasing. most company have a CEO/owner keep all the profit now adays"
good,"As long as you can follow directions and be responsible, this is a fairly easy job to have. There are many opportunities to change departments or advance in the company. Make sure you follow dress code and general common sense conduct and you'll be fine."
good,"Building displays checking in vendors stocking shelves ordering product for weekly sales. Hours could be long, benefits were very competitive good company ."
good,Everyone worked as a team. Everyone that works there is happy go lucky. If you don't know something then someone within you area would know the answer. Managers would check in on you to see how things were going.
good,"Great place to work!!!!!! Publix encourages you to do the best work you can. And by doing your best, you can grow through our promotion from within efforts.  Publix is dedicated to the dignity, value and employment security of their  associates."
good,The typical day at work was fun coming into publix and seeing both customers and co workers smiling and having fun. The evenings were enjoyable with the night crew cleaning the store and other departments as well. All in all the company as a whole was well run and my time with the company was completely worth it for the experience and friendships i developed over the years.
good,"Stocking lunch meat and cheese "
good,"There is not a lot of companies like this one anymore. They take care of the employees, and customers. Working retail can be hectic at times. But it teaches you to be fast paced and calm at the same time. Publix provides 401k to their employees. They give you stock, just for working there."
good,Publix is a fast paced wirk environment.  Every day is a change from the day before. Hours vary day to day and week to week. Every day is a new challenge from new product merchandising to dealing with associates and customers.
good,"really great workplace to work. I recommend anyone to come here to work. The pay was way more than I expected it to be. When you stay with the company and become full-time, the benefits are greats."
good,"Publix is a great place to work and overall the managers  will do what they can help you grow and get promoted. But it takes a while to be promoted to full time from part time. Publix has really great benefits as well even if your a part-time employee. Such as stock, which a lot of companies don't do, and the more than occasional discount or two. If you can get there they will give you health care and a 401k option. However you do need to work 32 hours a week for the health care option. I really do like Publix I just need something a little more."
good,"I worked in retail at Publix for 10 years. My roles were providing"
good,"The company does not give the opportunity to work full time. Good environment of work, flexible schedules. They offer constant training and opportunity to study and to be prepared."
good,"They had flexible hours, good pay for it being 10 years ago. Publix is a very professional place. I started as a cashier and ended up working the front and back office. The culture was diverse."
good,"Love the company .fun place great customer service .iam a friendly person don’t mind working with others ,caring for others  also good on training others"
good,A very busy store. Positive environment. Lots of hours to be worked. Stocking shelves and light housekeeping duties. People were very nice most of the time
good,Everyone is willing to help when needed. Questions can be asked and they will know the answer or find someone who does know. The work environment is neat.
good,Being able to converse with people is a big part of working in the deli. You must have good teamwork skills and be able to maintain quality customer service.
good,Publix is a great company to work for. The only issue was the hours are all over the place its not a set schedule. I started to get torn away from my kids.
good,Overall the Grocery chain is a great company to work for. The pharmacy divisions culture has change since my starting. Services was paramount but now with increasing labor cuts and centralized dispensing this has change.
good,"Worked there for quite a few years and enjoyed it mostly.  Like any retail job, you have your ups and downs but Publix as a whole was a good company to work for."
good,it a good company to work for cause u get health benefits but i think they need to pay a bit better than what they do and also i think they need to pay their part time employess when they take a vacation cause the part timers dont get paid vacation only full timers do
good,Most of all publix was a great beginning to my carrer in any type of field. I got to do a lot of things to test my self and the others around me. The only thing i didnt like was working night shift.
good,"Love working for them, and have been asked to become a Meals Clerk. I always talk with others about what meals certain things would be good to make, and how much fun it is to work at Publix"
good,"i  would come into work to cleaning "
good,"They provide you with training and videos to help you to be better in your customer service and even how to react in case of an emergency, they also teach you some sale tactics and how to prevent theft and loss in the store."
good,"Publix is a great company to work for if you're planning on being there a long time. Publix prides themselves on being owned by their employees, meaning that the stop is private and only purchasable by current employees. After about 3 years, the company actually buys stock for their employees. Who doesn't like free stock? There are other benefits like health, vision, dental, 401K matching, etc. For students, hours are pretty flexible. I had no issue changing my schedule every semester to accommodate my school schedule. For official full-time employees (not part timers who work full time hours) many managers are no as accommodating because being full time is a commitment. Overall, Publix is great for students and people who are looking for great retirement options."
good,It’s a real good company to invest in and for your future but they just don’t pay you enough  you get paid for your vacation you get paid for sick hours but all based on how long you been at Publix I mean is the really good company for you to  get  stock    Get a valuations
good,"Publix is overall good company. But they tend to be short on managers, so people who aren't quite fit for management slip through and have poor managerial skills and make working for them difficult."
good,"I truly enjoy my career at Publix. Associates, managers and customers made the long days go by quickly. Career opportunities are endless. Hardest part of the job was actually managing the few associates that just didn't want to do their job with pride."
good,"Publix provided their employees with a comfortable working environment. Sometimes, the work would get intense ,but they provided good pay and 401k. Publix was a good place to work."
good,"Overall it was a decent experience. The only thing that bugged me was the lack of follow through on how they wanted me to move up."
good,As a bagger I worked all day alongside my cashier coworkers and bagged groceries for customers daily. I would make conversation with customers and take their groceries out to there car if they needed the help. When my shift was over I would mop the store or pick up trash to prepare the store for the next day.
good,"this had to be the most boring job i have ever had in my life. it was so boring , all i ever did was walk around and deal with very mean boca people. tyhey ar"
good,a nice relaxed company to work in until in high demand your required to stay. on your p's and. Q's and required. to be a team player and meet demands.
good,I worked for them when I was in high school and they took advantage of me. The would always have me clean the bathrooms and get carts from the lot when it was 95 degrees or 30 below. I wouldn't get paid good for all my hardwork.
good,I would get there and count out tills for the day. Then assign jobs and registers. I learned how to send and receive western union and spot fraudulent money transactions. I also learned how to order and keep a front end stocked for seasonal and regular customers. The hardest part was when one of the team members could not make it the other staff had to step up there game and the best part was how close we all the employees were.
good,"Publix is a great company. I worked in the bakery which was a great learning experience, I really enjoyed it. The hardest part is the customer service part. You have phones ringing, people walking up to the counter, and people on the side of the counter who want cakes written on or have a  question. It was a lot, you need to be able to multitask for this job."
good,"I was working there part while I was studying in college. I was a part time employee. I did have 401K, the hours were very flexible so it was easier to take classes and work at the same time."
good,good place to work nice people friendly environment was part time as a college student learned a lot Publix is great company to work for room for advancement.
good,"Punch in, "
good,"Publix is both challenging and rewarding. I enjoyed my time there very much. My managers recognized hard work, leadership skills, and jobs well done. I was paid well for the what I was doing but eventually the amount of hours required in management became too much for me."
good,Fast-paced mornings. Management is easy to talk to. Breaks are short. Food is great so I don't have to leave the building to get lunch which saves me gas.
good,always learned of different groceries in the store and it was always nice to meet new people. hardest part of the job was probably trying to remember where items were.
good,The best part of it is your co-workers who are next to you who make it more fun to spend the day. Some employees just make you laugh. Greats managers.
good,"This was my first job I ever had and I think this really help to set me up for my future jobs and career. It teaches you how to interact with customers, and general know-hows to the company."
good,Publix was a great job . Depending on which department you work then you can depend on how much work you do. Customer service is the #1 priority. Respecting customers and giving them what they want is a great example of a Publix worker.
good,"good place to work. Gets kinda culty. cross trained me in many departments but never paid me for it, including being cross trained in a higher level position."
good,"The customers and staff tend to be pleasant people. Benefits are sufficient and the ability to buy into the company and own stocks was really a great. They also provide college tuition reimbursement,"
good,"Working as a cashier at publix was quite easy because of my previous work experience. So I pretty much got the hang of how things worked in that environment. Although there were some days where customers where difficult, I still managed to deal and respond with troubled situations in a professional manner."
good,the job there was very quick place even if there was some slow times everyone wanted there product quickly and with a smile even if there the rude's people ever.
good,I would recommend it to others. Good place to work for young and older people. Great for college kids when starting out. Free lunches and the benefits are good.
good,"Although I worked the closing shift and this often caused me to stay up until 1 or 2 in the morning, I was able to adjust my schedule around classes while I was in school. This provided me with an ideal job type during college."
good,I enjoyed my time working for Publix - was a great work experience. This was my first job I have ever had and would recommend it to someone looking for a part-time to full-time employment.
good,"Good place to work.  Hard to get hours.  So many rules, most of which make sense and some which do not.  Nearly impossible to get full time or benefits unless you stay for years."
good,Publix was my first job and i loved every minute of it. I would go to work and start my night with a great bindery team. Everyone that i worked with was awesome.
good,"Publix was my very first job as a teen. It is a wonderful workplace to get an experience in life, in all aspects/categories in life. It was truly an experience I'd recommend to any other young person to start."
good,"The work day at Publix, really depends on the flow of customers, but as a associate you are actively looking different tasks to accomplish throughout the day."
good,Worked at Publix for two years and it has taught me a lot of skills that i am excited to bring to my next jobs. I was a great first job and I sm grateful i got to experience it.
good,"Overall, Publix is a great place for getting a starting job and working your way up the ladder. The grocery chain in particular offers better and higher benefits than most retail grocery and its goal is to treat its employees and customers with respect, which is a favorable part of the work environment. However, this is particularly a place for  people who like to work hard and long days with only holidays for off time and some rare paid days off."
good,"My Experience with Publix was great. I was a part time Deli Associate and I was treated as family. However, Publix does not hire full time employees. The option of full time employee is earned which I can respect, this does but a damper on moral in several ways ie: part time associates are not afforded insurance, vacation days or sick days, no company stock or benefits at all. If you are required to work more than your scheduled hours, you are penalized on your next weeks schedule to scheduling software and policies. This being said I would highly recommend this as a job for students and people who have already retired from another career because, it is an incredibly friendly atmosphere and teaches outstanding costumer service (which Publix takes great pride in). Publix also participates in countless charity events and donations like the special Olympics, Red Cross, and several other great non profit organizations and school events in the community."
good,Great Company.  Great co-workers and management.  Great customers.  Room for advancement if you want.  Hard to get full 40 hours per week however.  I enjoy working in the positive and customer oriented environment.  Workers almost always smiling and eager to help customers and co-workers.
good,"I cashier and bag customers groceries.  When bagging I assist them to their car to help load them.  In produce, I stock items when they are low and help customers find what they are looking for."
good,Publix is a good place to work. Free lunch and other benefits help. I feel many of the founding principles have been lost. Hiring associates from within doesn't seem as good as it used to be. Years worked is trumped by a college degree.
good,"Great place to work, flexible with a school schedule or if you have a second job. Always room for advancement in job position as long as you have managers willing to help you out ."
good,Publix is a great place to work. It is typically a fast paced environment that can be very rewarding if you choose to make it so. The best part of the job is making it an enjoyable experience for the customers.
good,The people that work there are great. There is always an opportunity to learn and further your career.  The hardest part of the job was cleaning the equipment in the deli. Everything else was so much fun.
good,I learned a lot about exceptional customer service as well as working with others. I also was responsible for cash handling and balancing for every shift. I also help to train new employees.
good,"Publix is flexible with hours and will work with you if and when needed.  I learned communication skills, and grew relationships with other associates."
good,Great company good benifits great coworkers fun atmosphere clean store flexible hours great offers on merchandice would highly recommended others to apply
good,"I am the kind of person who enjoys having tasks to complete while at work and working at Publix had no end of tasks. The environment was relaxed so long as work was being done, which I enjoyed. The management was also friendly and willing to work with employees."
good,"Job was okay. Worked as a grocery clerk which anyone can basically do. Can be stressful at times, but is just like any other typical retail job. Okay for high school and college students."
good,Great workplace environment between co-workers and customers alike. Easy going environment from day to day. Hardest part of the job would be irate customers than are inconsolable.
good,"Publix is a great place to work. The pay and benefits are great, especially the free stocks. It's very physical work, even as a manager and long hour days. If you're in the retail grocery business I don't think you can find another company to take care of you as great as Publix had taken care of me. Great company culture, although it is slowly being lost and excellent management for the most part. Hard work is rewarded and you will definitely be able to grow and advance your career at Publix."
good,Everyone is really friendly and easy to get along with. The job is easy to do and the customers are very nice. The company is good and there is room to grow.
good,"It's a great workplace for someone that is just getting started, no real career advancement unless you are ready to work there for years. Some managers are great, some not so, you're expected to work within certain rules, but when a customer becomes bothersome those rules are thrown out and you end up looking ridiculous when the manager won't back you up."
good,Kool place to work with flexible hours. Also good advancement chances. Benefits are amazing and there are so many to choose from. Overall i enjoyed my experience.
good,"Every shift is slightly different from the last, but there is repetition in your work responsibilities."
good,"the only reason for leaving the good company job was due to me needing to move closer to all my family for personal reasons. what  did for this company has limited locations, otherwise it is a great company."
good,This is the second time working for Publix. I came back to work at Publix after my work permit was completed and returned to the United States with my family.
good,"During my time with Publix I have learned a very wide variety of skills including: receiving, scheduling, merchandising, team building, coaching, accounting and so much more. My time in management I learned to hire, goal setting, P&L, payroll, pricing, employee and customer relations. Publix has provided an environment that allows a person to grow and prosper. I found that the best part of working with Publix is the customers even though the days could be long and demanding making a customers day would make it a success."
good,"Enjoyed my time working here. I stocked overnight, it was very fast paced and challenging. If you put in the hard work you will be rewarded, many avenues to advance."
good,I wish that the managers showed the associates the same amount of care as they do to the customer then the employee. If the effort was the same the workplace would be a more comfortable to work.
good,"Caring managers, friendly staff, plenty of room for advancement.  Every customer made my day and I was always happy to be a part of their retail experience"
good,Publix offers an opportunity to advance in any area to become what you would like to with out having a college degree. Although the hours can be long and tough to handle.
good,Publix is a great place to work unless someone is picking on you and they don't do anything about it. I was harassed and they wouldn't do anything....
good,Advancement is slow but benefits are good.  Very good retirement program.  Takes a while to move up in management but is well worth the wait afterwards.  You work most holidays.
good,"Associates and Publix customers are the BEST part of this job. Everyone is always in a good mood. The friendly environment and atmosphere is contagious. You can't help but smile."
good,It can be a difficult place to work (like anywhere) but I was thankful for a job at the time. I don't feel that it is appropriate to write a review at this time.
good,"Having worked for Publix for almost 14 years now, I have learned a great amount of skills. No two days are alike while working at Publix; it is very fast paced and unique. Publix prides themselves in promoting from within and I have been a living example of that. I started working as a front service clerk at the young age of 15 and have since received different promotions to reach my current role as a Customer Service Manager. Some of the skills I have learned are amongst the following: premier customer service, excellent communication, decision-making, and strong leadership."
good,"Publix was an awesome job because the people there were nice and we all got along. The deli area stayed busy for the most part so we stayed productive all the time, I like how we could switch areas within the deli department from cooking, to serving subs, to slicing meats and cheeses, to doing inventory and stocking the freezer and we even made all kinds of platters!! Both managers had a great sense of humor and communicated with us like humans, they also made it a habit come out the office and help out with customers and serving samples. At the time my hours were pretty flexible and worked multiple shifts when needed. Publix is a great company to work for!!"
good,This was a part time job I would get there right in the heat of rush hour. I had to make sure that the food was cooked and ready for all of the hungry customers who had there taste buds set on what I was preparing and I didnt want to disappoint my fans
good,Great for people who desire a flexible schedule and competitive pay. Great place to acquire excellent customer service skills. Benefits are amongst top in the field.
good,"Help customers find the items they're looking for, check customers out. Learned about the different departments within Publix. Management was strict. The culture was busy. The hardest part of the job was couponers. The enjoyable part of the job was meeting different people."
good,Publix Supermarket is a great company to work with and nice to work with amazing peoples. Everyone gets along and works well with each other. Providing great customer service to our valued customers.
good,"It’s a good place to work very fast paced. The people there are very cool, nice and fun to be around. Just poor management and very lack of “team work”."
good,"Unload trucks. work the truck., stay clean and safe during the day. Fair schedule.Computer based learning. Management is easy to work with. Great benefits."
good,"in a fast pace setting of continuing replenish stock to the selves, but also supply a high quality of customer service to all patrons that are seeking assistance."
good,"Productive and fun work place"
good,I enjoy my time there. Getting to know the customers them getting to know u is great. Then working with the team u work with everyday and us becoming like a family is also a great perk.
good,In the grocery business stores are operated 24 hours per day so employers are needed around the clock.  During my time at Publix  as produce manager I learned the operations in other departments besides my own.  The hardest part of the job was finding reliable employees.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with satisfied customers and pleasant co-workers.
good,I absolutely loved working for Publix. I quit because i wasn't getting enough hours. The management in my department needed serious work! The typical day was very fast paced.
good,"Good start to acquire experience and start acquiring responsibilities"
good,it was a friendly environment and management is very friendly as well.  Can definitely elevate and has room for growth.  it wasn't hard as far as the job goes
good,Hours are extremely flexible and the environment is amazing love working for them. Management is very caring and the team work is great they work with your pay and hours and make sure everyone is happy
good,It was a decent job. I   just feel like i need something else to go along with my school schedule better and to be more flexible with my availability.
good,I do enjoy working at publix although sometimes I do wish that I would get a consistent pay check there does need to be more communication but we all work as a team and do have fun when we can we all work hard to make sure the customers are happy
good,"I worked for Publix for over four years. I started as a Front Service Clerk, and then I was promoted to a Cashier position. After four years of service, I was promoted to Customer Service Staff. Overall, I learned how to provide excellent customer service, supervise a busy front end, the chance to resolve customer complaints, and learn a variety of customer service staff tasks. I enjoyed working with the great people at my store. At my store, it did feel like a family, and I made many long-lasting connections. I only have two complaints, the pay and the management. Sometimes some of our managers were out of touch, and they would not investigate important issues carefully. The pay structure was not the best because you were often promoted and you had to wait months or years for a raise because they tend to prolong the training. A typical day is punching in and running a cash register, working the lotto machine, bagging groceries, and more. Finally, there were not very many difficult parts to my job, but I want to say it depends on your work location because when customers are angry, it is difficult to please them sometimes, and the coworkers and the family-like culture at my store were the most enjoyable parts of the job."
good,"During my time with Publix Supermarkets, I gained a lot of experience. I learned so much and met the most wonderful people. The company really treats their employees with respect and makes it an enjoyable place to work."
good,Publix grocery store where they pride themselves on customer service and keeping the store clean. The store I worked at had friendly coworkers that made it enjoyable.
good,"meeting different people, and able to assist customers with things they might not understood or just in general questions that customers ma have i try my best to provide the best answer or advice to them all."
good,"No comment but this website will not allow me to skip."
good,You can expect to constantly be on your feet and always have a good attitude. I learned a lot being that this was my first job. The culture was okay. There were people who didn't want to be bothered and there were those who were very helpful and friendly. Overall a good place if you're patient and work hard.
good,Its an ok job with ok benefits the environment is good and people are nice. Its just boring to do the same things over and over everyday. I want an interesting meaningful job.
good,I place that i enjoyed working and i would work there again if i could. i enjoyed helping people and i always brought smile to their faces. The hours and pay was great.
good,Very special people working there. I️t had a great environment. Helpful to all people.. very happy go lucky people. Great hours depending on work ethic
good,"normal days would involve stocking shelves, bagging items, and helping customers find items.I learned customer service and to help the customer in any way you can. Management  wasn't a problem treated be fairly even if I'm a minor. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting some interesting customers."
good,It is not a bad job. You own the company so that is a plus once you are offered stock which of I remembered is 2-3 of employment. It depends on which store you getvhonestlybis your work experience. Company wise....good company.
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job "
good,I enjoyed working there because its easy to learn and different things to do and you can make a career out of publix! You get lots of benefits! & hours are very flexible.
good,"I stocked shelves, did inventory, Sales Associate, bagged groceries and delivered the groceries to customers vehicle.  I can lift very heavy objects, work in cold, hot, rain, snow and all temperature weather.  I am a people person and enjoy helping customers find food items in the store.  I am very alert to anyone that is stealing or doing something that Security should know about.  I do not smoke and take a lot of breaks that other employees did take.  I am very dependable and feel like I am a great worker and team member.  I work very well with others that I work with."
good,A typical day at work was just clocking in at the required time and reporting to wherever the schedule for that day had me. Some days I was at the Customer service desk and some days I was on the floor cashiering. The most enjoyable part was being able to handle all the money and talk with the customers. The hardest part of the job was having to handle multiple customers at once at the customer service counter.
good,Working here was a joy it took alot of work in the bakery but it was worth it because when you see a customer enjoy your food it really made it worth wile
good,Just enjoyed working so much. Co-works so much fun to work with. Mangers very nice to work with. Had a lot of customer who love me and me waiting them.
good,"You start off as little as $8 an hour, and based on how you perform your manager lets you know if you get a raise or not. Its more competitive if you ask me."
good,"I have learned a lot about customer service and grocery management from Publix.  I have learned about a variety of different foods and how to prepare them, and I have met a lot of friends at Publix.  Overall, Publix has been a great place to work and is very flexible with my college schedule."
good,I learned how to process different species and cuts of meat.. They have a good management team and for the most part was fair as far as the work load and raises go..
good,"Publix marketing slogan is "" Where shopping is a pleasure"""
good,I feel no reason for this I’m just ready to get back to work thank you I have family and bills to take care of public was a great experience for me now I’m ready to move on do something else
good,"i enjoyed working for publix. unfortunately the warehouse was an hour and a half away from home. i thought i could be transferred to the Lakeland warehouse after a short time, but there wasn't any openings."
good,Publix was a great place to work and I did a lot there . I worked everything but I just feel like I want something new .I would come in put items on the shelve and restack things. I would unload the truck and put the items inside the store.
good,"Like any other place, you got to bring your own sunshine. In others words life is what you make it. There is people who I love to work around because if there attitude and then there is people who makes me want to quit sometimes. Be the person people want to be around."
good,Publix is a fair company to work for. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet for 8 hr. a day. The best is being able to meet new people and provide great customer service.
good,"Good place to work. I enjoyed it for the most part. However, I was a teenager and was going through a very rough time in my life. I wish I would have been a better worker, but management and everything was nothing lower than decent, but new management occurs very often. Getting paid weekly was something I loved too."
good,"Publix have a very flexible days and hours to work from.  It balance out with my 6 years old schedules at his school and other activities he has.  However, I have carpal tunnel on both hands, the right side is worse and it got worse from slicing deli meat at the Deli department."
good,"When I worked at publix I enjoyed the people there, although the deli was very stressful and lots of work it wasn't as bad as I began to get into a habit of things. Cleaning the hot case became easier and washing dishes became like second nature. However, working really early or starting at 5:00am was kind of tiring and at first Inquestioned the motive. But, I than understood that publix opens at 5:00am to begin cutting the sub-kits and starting up the ovens and oil drums in the kitchen."
good,It was a nice place to work and I actually made a lot of friends. The management at my location kept changing every week and that was about the only downside.
good,"I loved my job at Publix in Florida, the only reason i left is because i moved back to NY. I'm making plans to move back to Florida and as soon as i do I will apply at publix"
good,I enjoyed working at Publix. I enjoyed the customers and enjoyed working with my coworkers. Loved making my customers happy. If you didn't know something your coworkers was will to teach you with no problem
good,"Publix was a great part time job for me while I was in school. The hours were extremely flexible, and the company provided me with multiple opportunities for advancement."
good,"A typical day at work included, checking out customers, customer service, balancing cash drawer, before and after shift and returning products to shelf."
good,"Hours change from day to day in management, call outs on a daily have to learn to work with it, very fast pace, learned lots working with this company !"
good,"Great team players to work with Management does well in delegating each member to their most effective role. In most days I support each faction of our deli (Traditional, Sub-Shop, and Kitchen) making sure each associate can have their break in a timely manner. After the dinner rush most days I take care of waste and cleaning until the end of the day. The hardest part of my day is the Kitchen and keeping up with customers, time management is necessary and key to doing well. My favorite part of my job is Traditional it comes easy and talking to customers is always a pleasure."
good,everyone was nice and respectful to each other they handle they jobs pretty well and always get the job done. publix is a wonderful place to work at never meat a company
good,Overall A Good Company To work for. Good Managers. Good Flexebility with Hours and schedule Requests. Easy To work as a team. Everyone is very nice. and you get to learn alot of customer service skills
good,Publix is a good place to work for school people and someone with a good open availability. It is also a fun work place you deal with a lot of people it is interesting a lot happens and you also learn a lot that you end up like ah! Ok!
good,"It's rewarding to help people, and ensure that they have a positive and pleasurable shopping experience.  I enjoy the company of others, and Publix is a great place to gain experience and develop additional social skills."
good,"Everyone is working hard, smiling. Everyone is in uniform and looking there best. Hardest part of the job is being on my feet all day. Typical day is doing daily duties."
good,"Publix is a decent place to work. Especially, when your 'team mates', aka, the ones you work with are a great team. It also is decent place when your management is also helpful!"
good,Just be a people person.  Public is a nice place to work at and the people  who you work with makes it fun. The pay is decent and if you are a hard worker. You can advance in. A decent amount of time.
good,"This job is not for lazy people. I’m currently a Publix Selector and I’m telling you right now, if you work HARD you will get PAID. This is the best job I’ve ever had that pays good and feeds their employees at the same time for FREE!! And they play music while we work."
good,"Publix is secure, abundant, and a fun place to work."
good,job is very good but the customers is very picky about how you bag they groceries and always want you to smile .but the prices is very high .and is away clean .good customer service is very good .
good,I really enjoyed my time with Publix Supermarket as a meat clerk and only retired due to pressure from family members. Have considered returning to work part time.
good,"Great workplace environment and friendly co-workers! Excellent company and benefits! Managers are very professional and responsible, and give you very flexible hours."
good,"Awesome place. Good people and managers. Flexible schedules, and works well with any vacation needed."
good,"Publix is a good company to work for, but just like with everything else, there is always room for improvement. The morale of the store is not what it used to be and it's unfortunate. Managers get transferred too often. The worst part of the job would be pushing in carts in the heat and dealing with rude customers. On the other hand, there are also some great customers that you build a friendship with, and it doesn't take long for everyone at Publix to become family."
good,"Flexible with time off, and ability to set your own availability - even as a part time worker. Like any job, management plays a big role. That was a major reason in why I chose to leave. Try working different departments if the first isn't for you. Overall, great employer."
good,great company they take care of there employees in the long run. give you benefits and are understanding. management taught well on how to do the job and if you need help they were there for you.
good,"Provide premier customer service, make sure the aisles are stocked correctly. Close to closing time make sure everything is filled and reorganize the store for the following day."
good,it was one of my first jobs and i really enjoyed working there i was a stock clerk when i worked there and it took a day or two to get used to it but the mangers really helped me learn my job really well.
good,"Lots of rules and regulations. Overall a good job with good advancement opportunities. Large Corporation with relocation available."
good,"Great opportunity for career starting, young individuals.  This is a great company to begin your career with.  You start at the bottom and work your way up.  Hours and schedules are not fixed and change week over week, therefore, it is tough for a family man."
good,Spend most of my time either bagging groceries or being a cashier. Stocking the shelves. Management is good. the hardest part of the job is pushing the carts outside when it is hot.
good,"Publix is a fast paced, but friendly, family oriented place to work. your coworkers, and customers are like your family."
good,The workers were amazing people. They were all so kind and inviting. No one made me feel uncomfortable or gave me the cold shoulder. Everyone helped everyone.
good,"It was cool"
good,I’ve been working for Publix for about a year now and I normally at the closer I’ve worked for 2 stores one with day trucks and one with night trucks it’s totally different at each store you’re always running around and engaging with customers
good,"Working at Publix was a great experience. My coworkers were amazing and very professional, but they also became family. It was a great place to work because there is advancement and many opportunities to be able to make a livable wage with plenty of benefits."
good,"Atypical work day is busy and high pace. Deal with customer service both with drop off and doctors' office. Such filling prescription, refills, and answering questions with certain medications."
good,"This job was perfect for me while I was in school. Flixeble hours, relatively easy work with base pay above minimum wage and 6 month raises with good assessments."
good,"Minors are treated like they are a burden and have much much much stricter rules than actual child labor laws. There is no point having a job here if you are a minor because on average you will get 4-6 hours a week which is about a $20-$40 paycheck so yay for you, you can go to the movies twice. It's not worth having to schedule your time around and miss out on time with friends."
good,Good management. Can be fast paced at times or very slow depending on holidays/time of day. Great company. Good atmosphere. Sometimes you get rude customers.
good,"publix was a great place to work, because of the competitive envoirment of unloading and stocking the shelves for customers while displaying great customer service."
good,"I started working with Publix at 15 and four years later, I still work for them and am now just below management. The pay is great and I get a raise every six months."
good,"This company pays good money and has an excellent culture.  The company promotes from within.  If you work hard and show up for work, you will move up with this company."
good,"Publix is a great company to work for. Flexible hours, many options to choose what department to work. You typically develop great friends from there."
good,"A cheerful environment. Everyday is usually different. Lots contact with the public. Requires strong focus as well as the ability to complete multiple tasks at once,"
good,"I'm kept busy, moving around doing different things rather than sitting in an office chair doing repetitive work. Helping customers, filling stock, cooking, cleaning and doing dishes. If you can handle it, you can enjoy yourself."
good,"The store I worked at was new, and had limited it hours during the off-season(winter). Hours and receiving a full-time position is really competitive."
good,"A typical day at work, I either bag or cashier. Both require me to talk to my customer and make sure they were satisfied with their service and if they found all of their necessary items. I make sure my attitude is the best it can be because I am one of the last faces they see before they leave Publix, and I want them to have a good last impression. The management tries their best to compensate for their employees, and they understand that I am a student and that I have other needs. My coworkers are friendly and easy to get along with, and will help with any problem that I have. The hardest part of this job is understanding some of the managers reasoning as well as maintaining a positive attitude while having a bad day. The most enjoyable part is when a customer compliments you on your service, or having a really good day in general."
good,Relaxed and enjoyable place to work. Would recommend to someone who loves the food industry and would like to get ahead in this field.  Advancement is possible.
good,"This place is pretty nice. It hasn't given me any problems even when I left, It's cool, nobody really messes with you unless you've done something wrong to them, it's all pretty okay on my side."
good,"Publix was a great place to work,  I retired from Publix thinking I would change career paths.  That didn't work the way planned. Ended going to a different company doing the same work for less money.."
good,"Publix overall is a great company to work for. Like any other job it can be stressful at times, but you are usually surrounded by a good team depending on the store. The benefits are really good, and competitive pay. Chances for advancement are good in Bakery, Deli, Produce, and Meat. However Grocery and Customer Service are usually overcrowded with associates, and is not always likely to go to the best candidate."
good,Great place to work. As a service clerk you handle baggage for customers and picking up carts in the parking lot. Customers are very easy to get along with and so are the co-workers.
good,"A great company if you start when you are a teen.  Stock options, health insurance."
good,"Mostly cashiering. Learned how to use computer. Customer service skills. Using own initiative, occasionally depending on management.  Learning to deal with all types of customers, including difficult ones.  Hardest part of job standing in one place for hours. Most enjoyable part of job, making friends with repeat customers."
good,A typical day at Publix is working hard to get the job done . I started an early age and learn how to manage people through plenty of programs Publix is the place to work to get a head and to support your family and have a good future. My most enjoyable part of working for Publix and be in the management was meant touring new associates and a job and that made that job easier as they learn we had managers have to do less. As a company they like to move managers around to learn different areas and different types of customers to make a well-rounded. And 35 years I have learned how to manage customers and at the same time make a profit of the stores. Without customers we would not have jobs making them very special and treated them with pleasure.
good,"Great company to work for. Takes care of employees. Customers are jerks who want nothing more to be dheads. That's the main reason I left, people are mean."
good,"Publix is a busy Super Market"
good,"As a customer service/retail associate, I can definitely say I have learned behaviors of clients, I have attained pride in my assisting customers and handling complaints. Publix Supermarkets has a workplace culture that is not seen in other retail work places. There is a distinct difference between associates who have attained a certain level of communication with their superiors as well as with the customer base. The hardest part of the job is getting over the obstacle of complaints,(that, to a non-owner of stock in a company may seem a bit absurd!) and the most enjoyable part(s) of the job is/are that you get recognition from your loyal customers, the benefit perks are super, and that you actually learn something every day, whether it may be from being trained for a specific job/duty, or from your co-workers, customers....."
good,Publix is a great company and treats all of their employees fairly. They are always willing to give the best service to the customers and treat them to the best of our ability.
good,"Publix has always been a great stepping stone no matter the case. Whether it may be just getting a check, benifits, or advancing. Very friendly atmosphere."
good,"Excellent management at store 1430, associates and customers. The best workplace  culture because you know you are working for yourself, for your company!!!!!"
good,love the atmosphere very great people love being there convenient  place to work good benefits good hourly wages if you work hard enough. Good flexibility and good opportunities
good,The only reason why I left was because I was moving. This was a great work place with friendly staff. I was on my feet for most of the day but the days always seemed to fly by.
good,Publix is a great place to work with lots of benefits. The management is very helpful with building your career.  Plenty of time off with all the Vacation time.
good,"If you are willing to work hard, there is opportunity for advancement. Hours are difficult and change regularly. The people are great. Expectations by management are very high and sometimes it feels like there are not enough people to get all tasks done."
good,A typical day at work for me is pretty good. I learn that it is a very diverse place to work at which is great. The mangement team is good overall. To me there is really no hard part to the job. I get along with all of the customers and my fellow associates. The most enjoyable part of the job to me is being able to meet new people each and everyday.Working at Publix can be exhausting but there's always something to do so the hours go by fast. It can be difficult to deal with rude customers but you always know how to change their mood.
good,It's a very fast-paced working environment it's fun and you have great benefits. Everyone you work with is like family they only want to see you succeed and do great
good,"Publix is a customer oriented corporation. Our main goal is to satisfy our customers' needs the best of our abilities."
good,I enjoyed working here though i did have several coworkers whom took advantage of my work ethic. I think the pay could have been better considering i did my work as well as my coworkers.
good,Work/Life balance is better in IT than it is on the retail side. People are enjoyable to work with. Managers treat employees with respect. Compensation is below the industry average.
good,"Everyday went the same, you come in, group meeting, stretch and start your day. Everything was repetitive such as the work, breaks and lunch. The most enjoyable part of the job is the lunch because of the good food and sociable time with the other plant workers"
good,"I loved working at Publix. I really had a lot f pride because of how clean the store was."
good,"I work with great people at the company but as a Technician, we are not paid enough for the fast paced and responsibility level. My manager always makes schedule request happen."
good,I really like working at publix. I left for other opportunities. It was a very nice place meet a lot of different co worker. The store was a nice and clean place.  The store was a very huge.
good,"Working for Publix was a good experience. Learned a lot and my manager took a liking to me. Taught me that it is better to work smarter and not harder. Publix always took some time of the day to teach you new things and to help you grow in the company. If i could work there again, i most likely would."
good,"Publix does not turn away anyone that applies for a job.  When new people get hired, other part-time employees start to get less and less hours until they find a reason to let you go or you quit.  This also happens if you decide not to make steps toward management training."
good,"During my time at publix customer service was the biggest thing I learned. I was constantly speaking to people every minute I was on the clock, but I loved working there."
good,"Great place to work at some days are busier than other management"
good,You learn many skills working at publix. You stay productive throughout the day. Also you get to interact with customers. Publix's main quality is their customer service so you learn premiere service. The managers are hard working and are also good at working with your schedule. Working at publix was over all a good experience
good,"Rushed promoted managers as well as those who have been in the position too long make mistakes, They often forget the foundations the company was built on . Publix as a company is a great place better management training needed across the border."
good,Publix has a lot of opportunity within the company once you are hired on. Not to mention the pay is exceptional in comparison to a lot of other companies.
good,"Great place to work throughout school. But after that, I don't feel as if many employees get paid what they should for full time. Also, there is a lot of favoritism."
good,Publix is  a great company to work for!! you are vested into the company after only 5 to 6 years of full-time employment.  They are also great as a baseline of learning responsibilities and excellent customer service guidelines.  I really enjoyed working there!
good,"All the employees worked together and got along"
good,"Working at Publix is being part of a meritocracy. Depending on your attitude and work ethic, you can have a successful career. The only one holding you back is you."
good,"Great place to work for. If your young it's a good starting place where you can learn things pretty easily and fast. Also great benefits 401k, tuition reimbursement, and medical."
good,"My particular manager was very strict when it came to getting work done but was also encouraging and rewarding. During one of the most stressful weeks of the year, inventory week, the grocery managers pitched in to have a pizza party during this stressful time, in order to reward us as well as keep us motivated."
good,multi tasking is a must while working in this fast paced store. I have learned how to handle unhappy customers by compromising to make them happy and make their experience better while shopping at publix. the hardest part of the job is learning how to deal with multiple customers at once.
good,I love working here the only problem I had was me not being able to stand for a long period of time. Beside that I love working their. Publix is the place to go if your looking for benefits for you and your family.
good,Overall Publix is a great company to work for to get you started. Publix offers advancement for those who show promise and work hard. Work hard and get rewarded.
good,Publix is a good company to work for and the have a lot great benefits.  They fail short on somethings and they ask too much of their employees when it comes to most situations.
good,I would clock in. From there on is where I would go to customer service where my daily routine began and I would supervise cashiers and baggers and any customer discrepancies
good,Publix was actually a really good job. they had the best benefits out of any job out there you could really move up on the chain you just had to show them.
good,The Publix culture is outstanding !! great place to work and advance your career. You get what you put into it. Good benefits and a great retirement plan. Employee owned and profit sharing/stock purchase options.
good,there is a lot of talking to other people. You have to be a people person to work here. it is a very fun environment to work in and i actually met a lot of my friends at Publix. Eventually your department will begin to feel like family.
good,"Very flexible work hours.  Management is interested in the employee and strives to help him/her succeed.  Opportunities for advancement available and clearly defined. Pay is average for the type of work that you do, but the benefits are exemplary."
good,"Publix is a good place to work at. I never had any problems other than low hours but that may just be from my store itself. The staff is friendly and so are the customers. I would recommend it to anyone,"
good,Very nice place to work and shop as well.  Every one got along and the management staff was excellent.  They were able to work with their employees when it came to many things
good,I loved every second I worked here. The people are great and they helped me with a lot of people skills. I opened up a lot more here. The hours we're a bit long but with the right people it didn't feel long at all.
good,"The typical work day was habitual, but the diversity in customer personalities kept the day interesting. I have learned to better communicate with society as a whole in my time working here, and i am able to open up more to strangers in a kind manner because of it. However, management at the workplace showed favoritism, which sometimes resulted in unfair treatment. Overall, my experience at Publix has greatly influenced how i am today as a person in a positive way."
good,"Publix gave me the opportunity to learn and develope good customer service skills. I would rate Management at about a 7 due to yearly turn around. With Publix act of conduct, rules and regulations proper working skill is mandatory. I would say the position shapes you. The most enjoyable part of the cashier position is when the customer is satisfied and smiles, at that point you know you provided good service."
good,"As a whole, Publix was a great company to work for until they took away our inventory and retail bonuses to further their idea of becoming publicly traded. Until Publix goes publicly owned it is a good place to work, good people, good enviornment, good customers."
good,I worked in the bakery and it  was hard but fun. It was sometimes stressful but that was usually when it was a holiday or we were short staffed. Management was great to work with
good,Great company with excellent benefits and perks. Management always there to help and encouraging. Great starting pay with room for advancement in multiple areas.
good,"Overall Publix is a great place to work. I have enjoyed the people I have worked with and have even made some life long friends...I have also formed some lasting relationships with customers I have encountered over the last 10 years I've been employed with Publix. Very good benefits, and stock options. Fairly easy to move up, and somewhat competitive pay."
good,"Publix is an equal opportunity employer with extra benefits compared to other stores such as earning stock as you work. Publix works incredibly well around your schedule, most people there have multiple jobs and Publix is flexible enough to work with everyones availability. Publix is especially worth working for if you plan to make a career of it. You need to stay for 3 years to become 'vested' and receive the stock that you earned. It is very difficult to find and earn a full time position at Publix, I know many great workers who have been trying to get full time for over 3 years. Publix just did away with bonuses and instead gave everyone pay raise which is not affected by the max wage cap. Overall, Publix is not perfect, but it is a solid company to work for"
good,They have great benefits. Good pay and every week. You can move in the company if you would like because they promote with in. You to be great with people cause customer service is their biggest thing
good,"Bagging groceries, retrieving grocery carts, stocking grocery bags, greeting guests, and much more are part of the duties as a front service clerk. Hardest day on the job is around Thanksgiving."
good,"A typical day of work would involve being around nice co-workers!  I, as an individual enjoy working alone but this job has helped me build my work ethic.  The most enjoyable part of this job is seeing customers that I've built a bond with.  The hardest part of the job was when the schedule I use to work on a daily basis was changed and I had to start working hours I didn't usually work, this got into the way of family time but overall the workplace environment was smooth and didn't include much problems."
good,Great company for advancement but the family time was limited as a manager. Benefits were fantastic. 401k was a great benefit. Coworkers were fun to be around.
good,Nice friendly place to work with extremely flexible hours. The job consisting of providing customer service with a friendly smile at all time. Beautiful place to work at.
good,A typical day is normal. You learn a lot about people and money. Management is okay. The workplace culture is the average office culture. It is a very good place to work.
good,Typical day includes team work to provide premier customer service and maintaining an organized and clean store for pleasant shopping experiences. The management is very helpful and does a good job running day to day operations of the store. Workplace culture is team orientated.
good,"Very good company to work for, the workers are friendly and the management are helpful"
good,"Great opportunity and great company to work for, the hardest part of the job is problem solving and knowing what to do to help the customer but once you do, you feel very accomplished. The culture is very nice because there are a variety of different people and you tend to make friends that turn into family very quickly."
good,"Was great working with Publix, Clean and neat work place where you could learned all aspects of the job effectively. The hours were not so good since it would go 1st/2nd/3rd depending on if they wanted too change it. Great hours 40-60+ a week."
good,"All the customers are really nice when I help them out; they all give me really great reviews to the managers. I'm very good friends and well acquainted with my co-workers I work with, some can have a hard time to try to get along with you."
good,"Publix is a great company to work for, but not to make a career out of. I thought it was a great experience working here as my first job. Working here gets your foot into the door of the real world."
good,"A typical day of work as a cashier would start with a brief discussion with my manager about the work I was expected to do for the day. Sometimes this would consist of the manager telling me what register I was working at and nothing more. Other times I would learn about another department that I was going to help for part of the day, or a project at the front that I was going to be in charge of. The days that I spent in other departments were usually right after large shipments, where my manager would need help getting as much merchandise to the sales floor as possible. The projects at the front were typically displays that I would be organizing or new promotional items that I would be putting up in place of old ones."
good,Publix is a great company to work for! They pride themselves on great customer service! Publix offers good benefits if you work full time. Their pay is not very competitive but it was a super easy job.
good,"It is very hard to move up in the company. If you are able to, you will be well-paid. The company is becoming more corporate versus the past of being family-oriented."
good,"A typical day at work everyone is friendly. I've learned to work hard and be dedicated. Management is amazing, you can always run to them. Hardest part of the job is long hours they work you like a slave haha"
good,I selected at Publix Dc for over 3 and a half years. Selecting can be taxing on your body but you determine how much money(per hour) you make. Just find your pace to make whatever dollar amount you want to make per hour and stick to it.
good,I am not interested in giving reviews about my own personal work experience but this field is required so I am taking the time to just fill this space.
good,"Publix was a good company to work for in that they treat you with respect, but they work you really really hard. I would come home exhausted every single day. If you work hard to try and move up though they will do that for you, personally I didn't."
good,"Publix is great in that you can start from the bottom and work your way all the way to the top regardless of your education or experience. If you are willing to put in the time and effort that it takes to be a leader in this company, the sky is the limit. Just be prepared to work weekends, holidays, and strenuous hours."
good,Part-time workers really don't get benefits except for a raise every 6 months. Publix is a great place to shop but some managers can be really a pain. I've been there for a year and they are really strict on policy. It can be a great place to work though
good,"Publix is a nice store to work at."
good,The hardest part about the job is constantly keeping busy even when there was nothing left to do. The management I felt could use better handling when speaking to other fellow employees. A typical day at work was satisfying and easy going.
good,"Working at publix is calm and relaxing at times. You have your customers that you love to see everyday, but then you have the ones that will just come in the make a scene to others. I enjoy working with most of the people and the management. Through the years I have never heard of anyone having a problem working with me because I am a great guy to work with. Publix was my first and only job. I knew nothing about the company, but have learned a lot within the 6 years working there. I started of part time and worked hard to become a full time worker at the company. The hardest thing that I have to deal with would be pulling or breaking down a truck by myself but can always get it down in a timely Mainer. That I have learned to cut meat it is something I really enjoy doing."
good,"I learned a lot having Publix as my first job. Spending more than 8 years there, developing relationships and friendships, as well as learning the ins and outs of what customer service is and what it truly means."
good,Stock shells unload trucks with needed to unload trucks help out on the floor cashiers sometimes when needed as cashier in just helped around the store when needed as
good,"Working at Publix was a fun experience for a starting job. Everyone was friendly and I never felt lonely working there. After three years working at Publix, I started to get to know customers and care about their well being. Ultimately, I did enjoy my time at Publix"
good,You are evaluated every 6 months and eligible for a pay raise depending on how you score. Management is decent and the work isn't too difficult. Good place to start while in school.
good,"-My days involved decorating cakes and various desserts, checking dates on products that were out on the sales floor, rotating stock, placing orders for supplies, communicating with Customers to place special orders"
good,"On a typical day working at Publix, it involves talking to management to verify the days goals. Once they explained what is expected of you for the day, you begin performing the tasks. Management have been very flexible and seem to understand realistic goals. The hardest part for me was district manager visits, it seems that their expectations are not aligned with company expectations. This causes conflict with store management and employees as they are following company guidelines and customer requests, but don't meet DM expectations. Other than that, I would say the company is a joy to work with and offers a great opportunity for those interested in having a job that will grow with them and have an environment that feels more like a family than a job."
good,"I was blessed to work for Publix starting off as a young man and while the hours were difficult, the tasks tedious and days where it seemed like management didn't care: I can say honestly you will be hard pressed to find better. If you're in college they'll be flexible, supportive and above all a home. Keep a good attitude and Publix will be a great place to work. Find your niche within the company and it'll pay off more than just quarterly dividends."
good,It was a decent job. Had no problems. Was good working there while I could. Not much more to say they do appreciate everything you do there good people
good,"Working for this company you are always on the go working with customers and associates on a daily basis and making sure that all needs for the business are met. Making schedules to fit the business needs, ordering product for upcoming deliveries, and managing a crew of 20 people are just a few of the everyday responsibilities."
good,"On a typical day I would clock in, be called to the back room for a crew meeting that summarized the daily work load. Usually unloading the truck for the day, levelling the shelves forward, managing sale items, and taking care of customers."
good,everyone at publix has a very positive attitude and can be friendly and helpful. we also take the customers bags to their car and unpack the groceries into the vehicles.all smiles
good,"customer service, bag grocery, cashier, lotto, cash checks, western union, balance cash office, train new office staff, cross train in other departments."
good,"Within a 8 hour day for me, i have operated and or given breaks on the Bread/Roll Lines, and I have packed up the product for the stores.  I have learned so much working in the operation because I am very noisy asking a lot of questions on how things work around here. Management is pretty cool and try to help when needed.  The hardest part about this job is dealing with different attitudes and personalities."
good,Publix is a decent place to work. I would like to get more hours and learn more about the company to be able to advance. The managers are good and I enjoy working there.
good,"I loved working at Publix. Although you do not receive many hours or benefits unless you are in management, it is a wonderful part time job to have on the side. Very friendly environment and management, as well as the way customers are treated."
good,"Everything that has been published about the company is true; it is a great place to work. There is a reason that the company has been listed, for the past 20 years, as a great place to work!"
good,"Publix is a friendly environment with friendly workers. All workers help make publix a great place to work by helping each other and the customers. Also, with flexible work schedules."
good,"First job, and loved it. They're very supportive and not discriminating at all. Pay was great as well as added benefits. They often work around your schedule as much as possible."
good,"A typical day at Publix as a cashier was standing in place for several hours, handling transactions, problem solving, sometimes dealing with difficult customers. Most of the time the day goes by smooth and time goes by fast since you're dealing with a high volume of customers so you're always busy"
good,Good place to work. work life balance but no remote work so it was difficult at certain times. Understanding team members and helping authorities. Less pressure at work.
good,managers and employees were good to work with and good pay and good on flexable hours really enjoyedn working there would love to work there again if i move
good,"This is DEFINITELY the best company that i've worked for. From the front service clerks up to the outside management, i was treated like more than just an employee. I met individuals that i have built life long bonds with and continue to communicate with at this very moment. Great place great vibes."
good,"I have enjoyed working with this company, but I am trying to find something that is more career advancing/oriented with better hours to balance out my work life and home life. I have a small child that I would like to be home with on the evenings and weekends."
good,"Pros"
good,I really enjoyed working at Publix. They gave me great hours because I was going to school. All of my co-workers were extremely nice. I had to leave the job because there was a better job opportunity.
good,"Grocery stores are usually always some sort of busy, so you have something to always do. Whether it may be stocking shelves, lining things in coolers, FIFO, helping customers, developing customer relationships for return visits or practicing safety procedures while cleaning, you will always stay busy. "" If you've got time to lean you've got time to clean."""
good,"Good company, people, and culture work for, enjoyable job great workplace and great benefits. always learning something new, but it didn't work out for me."
good,This is a great place to work. Great benefits and pay for the position Most of the work is part time and it is not many opportunities for full time you have to suck up to the management to advance
good,"Recently, some of the benefits that drew me to Publix have been taken away. Quarterly inventory bonuses have been replaced by a small raise, which only some employees received. I've been here for a year and put in 2000 hours, but still don't have health insurance. That said, the pay is better than any other retail job I've had, the management is pretty good, and the atmosphere is great. My vision and dental insurance were awarded pretty quickly, and are very nice. It's hard to move up, especially in small towns, but that's probably why we've got such great management. All in all, I'm pretty happy with the job even though it isn't what I thought it'd be."
good,"It is a great place to work, it is always busy, there is always something to do. The customers are very nice and they are very helpful. We never got any problem."
good,"Run the cash registers, greet customers ring up items providing customer service. Collecting the shopping carts from the parking lot is the hardest part, talking to customers is the most enjoyable part."
good,"On a typical work day I would bag groceries, engage with customers in a friendly manner, provide help where needed and give good customer service."
good,"Publix is a a great company that provides a safe and organized work experience. As well as great benefits and they co workers there are close just like family. "
good,I do Aprons where I cook and sell recipes.  I have to show customers how to cook the recipe and then sell them the ingredients to make the recipe at home.
good,love working with the public helping them find what they are looking for. Taking their orders to make they parties a success. making some one happy to get great quality meats and cheeses and fixing them a good quality lunch
good,Typical day at work I'd come in and check email then make sure we had enough associates for the shifts. Deal with customers and their complaints or just provide great service.
good,Publix was a great place to work they just could not give me enough hours. the staff and management were very nice and the job was customer service oriented.
good,"Working at Publix is a pleasure. A typical day here is constant interaction with the customers, which is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"in the  2 1/2 years i was with the company i enjoyed working there. I wasn't happy with the little hours i was receiving and not being presented with full time. My employees were up beat and fun to work with ... i loved meeting new people everyday. grew friendships with most of my customers, seeing them everyday ."
good,"While working at publix can be repetitive just like any job in the food industry, it really is an excellent place to work. They provide great benefits to their employees and they treat you well. The people I worked with at Publix were some incredible individuals that I was able to learn a lot from as a 15 year old high school student. I highly recommend publix as a first job, but I have no valuable input to give about jobs higher up the chain of command."
good,ive learned how to communicate with customers and help with there needs. I've learned how to dynamically sell items and how important it is to my department and store.
good,A typical day as a meat clerk was to stock the departments lunch meat and cheese section as well as learning how to cut meat and run the seafood department. I learned how to identify all the different meats that Publix sold and also how to cut most of the meat. The management was generally very helpful in wanting to see you advance in your career. The hardest part of the job was to make sure the department looked the best it  could while maintaining daily quota's and tending to customer needs.
good,"I work in the deli so it's very very busy, but overall I've met great people and its and easy to move up positions. Management is okay, but there's a lot of micromanaging involved. They stress great customer service VERY MUCH, but it's a fun environment."
good,Great company but just be ready to work hard and wait a long time to get promoted. Pay could be better but employs and management are great! Would recommend
good,i was fortunate enough to have some really good managers and only a few terrible ones. its a great company to work for with good benefits.
good,"My experience while working at Publix has been enjoyable and educational. The management and staff are helpful. The company promotes professional and personal growth. The daily managers meetings held are geared towards prompting productivity and success."
good,it was a typical work day with alot of things to do and sometimes the machine doesnt work so we go help others if needed or clean up. It was also like a soap opera its always something going on.
good,Hospitality and customer satisfaction are held to high standards. Publix is all about meeting its customers needs and making sure that each trip to a Publix supermarket is an enjoyable one.
good,"I worked for Publix for nearly 15 years until relocating to NC in 2007.  I regretted leaving the company and not being able to transfer since there were no Publix stores in NC at the time.  I worked as a pharmacy technician and learned a lot from my direct supervisors.  Every day was a new learning experience while working with prescription drugs, regulations and the public.  I must say the most rewarding part of my job was assisting the elderly and educating them in the importance of medication compliance."
good,"The publix atmosphere is welcoming, and the benefits are great. The only issue i have with it is the you have to be employed for a long time to have an opinion. "
good,Hard work and it pays off I'D recommend this place. For anyone trying to accomplish some type of discipline.Benefits are outstanding 401K is the best the staff lots of hospitality friendly environment and professional.
good,I learned how to work with a lot of team members and how to deal with all kinds of customers. I gained experience in leading and supervising different crew groups.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of bagging groceries, helping customers, blocking the store, counting my til, answering the phone, and helping clean the store."
good,"started working with a friend that decided to build a small bussiness, well hes no bussinessman, his company is failing and i have family so its time to go"
good,"I honestly had the best time working for publix very professional environment, and positive energy all around. Great place for a first job to start with."
good,"Publix has a long history of treating it's employees fairly, and has great benefits as well. Some Department Managers can get a bit egotistical, but most are fair in their judgements and reviews. Daily workload is generally fair, and most co-workers are easy to get along with."
good,"Three p.m to about three a.m is a typical produce loader work day. The management is caring and stress safety, the most I've ever witnessed. The co-workers are positive and welcoming."
good,"I loved my job here, most customers were nice. Management was great until they switched them out and put them in different stores and bought new people in. Their attitudes sucked and it bought down the morale of each individual worker (customers too)... That's what made me quit FYI."
good,"Working in Miami, it was definitely an experience. I have learned a lot workig with different people from different cultures and backgrounds"
good,A typical day at work for me is a positive and full of energy day. I try to learn something new everyday at work. Im always here to help my managers and coworkers. Hardest part of the job is bringing personal problems to work. I try to only apply to jobs I can be passionate about.
good,"everyone was nice and had a great attitude to work with a clean environment, excellent place to work. advancement and raises are quite easy to obtain as well."
good,It's a good place to work at. Working with Publix has allowed me to learn about premier customer service and that's something that I will use for the rest of my life.
good,Good place to work. Company that hires within. No set schedules. Must work weekends and holidays. Managers can be a bit bi-polar.
good,"Every workday was redundant as the position I was in didn't allow for much creativity. I learned many new skills from well organized training classes Publix offers it's associates. The management has it's pros and cons. Coworkers are ok, but I never got to know any of them. The hardest part of the job was putting up with the lack of diversity in my department. The most enjoyable part of the job was the benefits Publix provides."
good,Excellent benefits and I enjoyed working there. I would definitely refer friends to work at Publix. Publix was a great company to work for. Never a dull moment during the day.
good,"Within the deli department there's always something to do, really making it the most difficult department in the store. However, the atmosphere of Publix provides a welcome-friendly type vibe making it a great place to shop."
good,"It all comes down to how many hours you expect a week. You could be a great worker and they will give you no more than 20 hours a week, and give another worker which doesn't do much 35-40 hours a week."
good,Like most retail companies Publix hires you in part-time and can play this game for years. But very family oriented company would definitely re-apply. Management has their picks and chooses.
good,"I learned the proper ways to store and handle raw meat, how to properly unload a pallet safely, how to rotate and stock products, properly do inventory, and how to work the front meat and seafood counter such as wrapping up product and answering questions about quality and location of meat. Publix was more than willing to train you in any area of interest."
good,It was fine to work there. Schedule all over the place. I didn't like how strict they were about facial hair and tattoos and stuff. It's like they all uptight
good,"Gives you chances to advance with the company if you would like to be more than a part time employee. Has good benefits but hours can be severally cut when company has to cut back overall its a good company,"
good,"Fantastic place to work, great benefits, great managers. I work in the Deli, which by nature is a very fast paced place to work, but it's worth the challenge. It makes you grow up quickly, it teaches you how to stay calm under pressure."
good,It's a great place to work for. Great work environment. Enjoyed the people I worked with. I grew a lot while working there. I grew more in my customer service skills. I worked in the produce department I opened and sometimes closes the department.
good,"I loved the atmosphere working there, everybody is very friendly.  I got along with everybody very well made some new friends and had a lot of good times. Great place for working with people with busy schedules."
good,"One of the best grocery storestore I've ever worked. It is indeed top 10 jobs to work at in the US. I liked working here. Only reason why I quit was because I needed to move on with my life and stop working in grocery stores.  It's a great place to work and would recommend to everyone who needs a job. Management is good, staffs in every department is excellent too."
good,"This was my first job starting at 15 years old, typical day at work would include basically performing the same work all day. Greeting customers with excellent customer service Publix is big on that, following greeting, scanning customer items and accepting payment methods of card or cash to complete the checkout process. Hardest part of the job would be standing in one spot for long periods of time, and the most enjoyable would be customers with great personalities who appreciate your customer service."
good,"When working at Publix, we were talking with customers constantly and needed to drink often. They would not allow us to keep a water bottle at our register and we were stuck there until someone could relieve us. Never again will I work there!!!"
good,"As we get older our shift in perception goes to our future and our savings and benefits. Publix offers both which makes it on the list of some of the best places to work in certain areas. The management staff is very professional and friendly. And since Publix is Employee Owned, your hours never seem to dip too low with raises every 6 months. In fact the only complaint I would say I could possibly have would be that promotions take an increasingly long time to come by."
good,this is one of the better Stores i have worked for  they are friendly and help customers find what they are looking for. this is a non union company so they are more chances to get promoted
good,Working here for 4 years they try to help with your hours but get new management every one to two years making it hard to keep your schedule consistent
good,I had a overall good time working for this company . At the time i was a young man trying to find my way in life. Publix was my first real job and i enjoyed my working time there.
good,"My typical day at publix is long usually a 7-10 hour work day."
good,The job was physical and demanding at times. Some stores were better to work at than others. The district management did try to keep you within a reasonable distance to your house. Customers were usually great to help with( even the ones that were upset)! The stock and 401k was awesome. Most upper management were great!
good,"Great company to work for."
good,"Manager was immature, never good compliment, always wanting more, the bonuses were great but the manager should be screened for maturity. Corporate needs to weed out the bad management and pay more attention to the associate s"
good,A typical work day is to very productive. To learn new ways to do my job better. Mgr. Is very helpful the hardest part of the job is working short handed but the most enjoyable part is seeing the customers smile.
good,Publix is a fast pace environment in which i am in charge of several different task and i always do my best to complete everything i am assigned
good,Friendly environment. Always the best customer service. Management was always there to help when needed. I learned that having a positive attitude will always get you far with your company.
good,"My normal day at work consisted of running the entire customer service department, including but not limited to training all associates, new and old, running payroll, and upholding corporate standards. All of this was done while dealing with our customers every shift."
good,"apart from some bad employees publix is a good place to work for, they give you amazing benefits and they was with you if you're a student."
good,"its a fun place to meet new people and form bonds! If you love to help people, then this is the place for you! the managers made sure that i was confident in my work before leaving me on my own! my co-workers were fun to be around and we were a team!tne oay was great every week!"
good,"My experience with publix was okay. I cannot see myself going back unless I am full time because as with most jobs, there isn't good opportunities for benefits. It was hard to get full time but very possible if you have the right mindset and want to make it a job to have for at least a few years."
good,"Great place to work, friendly environment, great team effort , a place I will work to again, great management team very respective and understanding love being apart of the team"
good,"great benefits for full-time employees"
good,"Working at publix, I have enjoyed the work. Customers are the number one priority. Everything must be kept tidy and clean on my department. The deli is a demanding department. There isn't any time for a break. I even missed my breaks a few times, due to the lunch rushes. The day seems to go by fast when you are that busy."
good,"No more place for growth but they are very considerate with their employees..They have new rules which maybe a little unorthodox but all in all, its a very stable and fun company to work for."
good,"Publix was a great company to work for. all the benefits were great, stock, quarterly inventory bonuses, 401k, united way drives, march of dimes drive"
good,"Publix was my first job, helped me learn about the work field and about customer service. Friendly staff and always helpful."
good,"Results-driven Customer Service Representative with proven ability to establish rapport with clients, Solid team player with great positive attitude Provide quality customer service as well as Energetic and reliable, Courteous demeanor, Large cash/checks depositor expert."
good,"I was a diligent worker who got along very well with co workers and had raving customer service reviews, however I was never allowed the ""promotion"" (or so they called it) of cashiering AND bagging. Unfortunately, bagging positions are usually for the very young, very old, or disabled. Starting out at 15, I was happy to fill a slot. But as I grew with the company, the company refused to grow with me. I was too good at my job and soon found myself picking up a lot of slack from my co workers who were genuinely trying their best. I could never blame them and I never complained. However, I put in a change of title form several times and spoke with the managers; every time being rejected. I was soon helping cashiers who were younger than me work their register with the knowledge I had picked up from my two years of working there. Were I not moving, I may have left that job on much different terms."
good,Good job to start out with. This was my first job. I loved it. The only reason I left is they didn't give enough hours but pay was good.
good,"I love the way Publix treats their associates. It was a Pleasure working for them. If they were on the west coast at the time I left the company, I would've stayed with them!"
good,"Publix is rated one of the best companies to work for in the country, and that is no understatement. Every manager treats you with kindness and respect, you get fantastic benefits if you stay with them long enough, and it is very flexible."
good,My job at Publix has been a great way to support myself during college. I have been there for eight years and the schedule is incredibly flexible.
good,"Overall just a great place to work, management was very nice and understanding. Crew helped to feel right at home and eveyone did their part."
good,it was a job while i was in school in Atlanta. it was OK but not a carer i would want too follow for the rest of my life. nit was fun i like working with ppl who want something better than where they where at . i have nothing bad too say nor anything good it was just a job that like i said was too help me get threw school at west wood collage.
good,"had gotten a new deli manager and she would not help at all, liked the people i worked with, and the customers. I enjoyed my job was being trained to be a manager."
good,the people are good and the managers a nice and fun. talking with customers and learning what they like or don't like is good experience.
good,Publix was a lot of hard work and labor which taught me responsibility. There was a lot of cleaning involved which caused me to stay at the store for long periods of time late at night. I could not manage working so late at night.
good,I enjoyed the people that I worked with and working the Printing environment. The Publix culture was satisfying and the pay was great with lots of room for advancement.
good,"work over three years had to maintain clean and tidy checkout areas keep reports of transactions, greet customers, pleasantly deal with customers to ensure satisfaction."
good,Very exciting place to work for. I gained much needed skills to have a productive lifestyle. I also loved the customers I interacted with daily.
good,Fast paced work environment where team work is crucial. The days can be very long depending on how hard your co workers work. Great culture and great benefits. Great customer service is the norm.
good,This company is great to work for. I enjoyed working for this company. The customer service I give is at a 100%. Sometimes the management is unknown on how their employees work very well with the customers nor the work they are given to do.

good,"The management is good, the environment is good, moving to a different position can be a hassle. The work can be tiring but it is not that bad."
good,"When I first started at Publix I did not think the job would require a lot of thinking but I was wrong. I am a person that loves to learn and uses to skills to make my job easier. There are quite a bit of rules and procedures at Publix when in comes to stocking shelves. I am the stock clerk in charge of building displays at my store. Displays of sales and new items is a big part of the dynamic selling that Publix tries to employ. This job has also taught me that there is a lot of time and effort put into a grocery that everyone doesn't see or takes for granted. The Hardest part of the job is relying on other co-workers to get their job done. Publix's allure is their customer service. Publix really strives to hire people with exceptional customer service, so much so, that they will over look the performance aspect."

I have learned excellence and premier customer service at all times. The hardest part of the job was unable to make every customer happy. Some customers where not happy even if the management went above and beyond for them. The most enjoyable part of work is to see customers who have their routine and who became great friends as the years went by.
good,It is a retail environment. You must be able to handle customers and handle them well. I've learned that not all managers are leaders and that sometimes finding a leader can be hard.

good,"Making sure all the customers came in and out quick and easy. Assist them with finding what they need and checking them out. "
good,"Publix is a great company to work for; they offer you any number of benefits for working there and staying for a long time. If you don't mind customer service, this is a great place to work. In my particular store, management could be difficult to deal with at times."

I provide excellent customer service, making sure that every customer is satisfied with my company and the products they are buying. I've learned not only how to efficiently work as a team, but how to maintain a positive atmosphere and work environment. Customer service is the number one thing Publix bases their company around. With that being said, I have also learned to handle situations where a customer was not happy. Ensuring that they leave our store satisfied because I took care of their needs. Management makes sure to properly instruct me how to follow policy by the book, and to be efficient. My co-workers and I act as a team, not allowing any of our work to fall on the next person/shift. The hardest part of this job is making sure that everything is up to Publix standards. If the baker does not notice that something is underweight, or does not look the way it should. It is my job to make sure that it is corrected before it is even seen by customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is having the knowledge to accurately answer any questions that my customers have and seeing them leave the store with satisfaction in not only our product, but our service as well."

The hardest part of the job is when there is a lot of behind-the-scenes preparation that needs to be done but many customers needing immediate attention. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to meet and exceed our customers' expectations and seeing the pleasure on their faces when we have accomplished that.

At Publix people can get hired when they turn 14, whereas some of the employees have work there for 40+ years. There are lots of different nationalities and temperaments. The co-workers are the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of the job is the constant beat down from customers. I personally attribute that to the policies of the company trying to compete with other grocery stores. I enjoy that there are different problems to solve every day and we get to interact with so many people. I am very willing to learn and try new things that need to be done within the store."

good,I usually work a cash register or bag a customer's groceries. I learned that providing quality service to the customers is important for your image as well as the image of the company. Many times you will find management working just as hard as the people below them or ensuring that everyone is continuously working hard. My co-workers for the most part are content with their job and current position. The hardest part of the job is working with people who do not want to work and customers who are difficult to assist because they bring outside issues into other circumstances.

I learned how to deal with all sorts of customers, and management helped in this by establishing clear sets of guidelines on how to interact with customers and the importance of customer service. The co-workers were very friendly. The hardest part of the job was picking up the shopping carts from the parking lot during the summer. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to assist the customers and putting a smile on their face, making sure they leave the store happy and content with their purchase and the service."
good,"I start work at 4pm to 1am. I stacked off my pallets, then moved on to help someone else. I tryed to help with anything I could in the store, so I can learn about everything.

It’s hard to fine good worker’s, but it’s even harder to find good worker’s to do a monotonous job. If you can deal with low IQ workers with no common sense who don’t understand how to make it easier for the next guy and the retail life, then there is no better company to work for with these good of benefits"

It had given me confidence, discipline, and a family outside of my home. The management was really good; they cared about their employees and what was going on in their lives. The workplace culture was really positive. There were always good vibes and good energy. The hardest part of the job was staying happy, but it wasn’t hard because of the good energy all around you. I enjoyed talking and meeting new people the most from that job."
good,"Working for Publix is not an easy task, but it takes hard work and great knowledge in order to take care and make sure the customer is leaving satisfied. Throughout the years you learn more and more to help you advance in your job."
good,I learned a lot as far as it gave me my first opportunity at a job it was very productive. As far as a typical day there it was very smooth you had a lot of responsibility therefore it kept you busy and ready for work.
good,I worked here as my first job It was easy and they have weekly pay and great scheduling for part time. I worked here for a couple of years it was a great job that you can make into career if effort is put in.
good,Really good solid job. Get to meet great people everyday and have good co-workers. Customers that always come back show alot kf love and greatfulness. Managers always on top of their job helping everyone.
good,"Publix is great in atmosphere and with people you work with. The hours are not great for family life if you are full time because it is retail, so you work a lot of evenings/nights and weekends. But the schedule is flexible and managers are almost always willing to accommodate time off requests. Publix does so much to give back to the communities and to their associates. It's a family. In the past couple of years some changes have been made that I personally dont agree with and that I believe the founder would not like. Though overall it is still an outstanding company with many benefits."
good,"Come to work, hold a safety meeting, check the attendance and head to production floor.it is manufacturing company and i am in charge of 20 to 30 associates."
good,It's a great place to work if retail is your passion. It's a great company with great benefit. It provides associates with a chance to advance from within the company.
good,"Overall, my experience with Publix was very positive, it is a very good company. I would recommend as a good starter job, it is also possible to move into management as well."
good,"one of the best places to work for longevity  for flexibility as well.. there is strong promotion for people that work their butt off. always customer service first, keep mouth shut, do your job,  and go! they do promote within and they see the best people  for the job. there is stock that the company gives out and you can buy your own and they also have reimbursement for education for any who qualify!! also health dental vision 401 k plans and matching from company..tey promote within the company usually within 3-6 months"
good,It was a great place to work but very competive. Management was great and they couched you if or when you needed it. Great benefits and hire with in. Loved the environment just wasn’t the job for me.
good,Overall my experience at Publix was great! From day 1 they worked with me to insure I had everthing I needed to understand and best do my job. It was a fun 3 years!
good,"Publix has always treated me well. If you’re in high school or college it’s definitely a job you’d want to work at. It really is a team effort when it comes to getting through your shift & getting everything done. One person can’t do everything & if it comes to that, then it can become very stressful. The only thing I wished Publix & management would be better at is making sure associates are on task. Lots of the veterans who have been for a while like to roam off during their shift."
good,At Publix I learned a lot. I learned how to be more out going and how to deal with unhappy people while I did not become the same. Not to mention the pace that I learned I like to put myself in as in I like to keep going so that the time goes by quickly and I do a good job at the same time.
good,Find a system that works for you..work efficiently ..team work and I had a hard time at first no system rushing aga6thd clock but I got it down with help of other selector
good,"As a bakery clerk, you get to be around amazing people with different skills that help you achieve your personal goals along the way while learning new and exciting lessons. You can challenge yourself every day with being a better worker while providing great customer service."
good,It’s an okay company to work for. It’s got good benefits like tuition reimbursement but they pay isn’t enough after a while. Moving up quickly is good but you don’t get the pay you deserve with the responsibility you uphold
good,"Hard work and a company you can stay at for your entire career.  You have a lot of different departments that you can work in, if you do not find and exact one that you like at first."
good,I’ve worked at Publix for 5 years now and it has been hard to stay with the company wherever you go no matter the store there is guaranteed going to be someone that is super pushy about everything.
good,"Customer service roles at Publix tend to be very stressful, as you have to deal with a high volume of (occasionally difficult) customers. Overall though, the experience was enjoyable and their upbeat management help to reinforce their unmatched corporate culture."
good,"Working with Publix has been fun and a great learning experience. Every day I was taught how to create better desserts, more creative cakes and how to manage my time to accomplish all the production needed for the day."
good,You can work any shift from opening to closing. Part-time usually get 20-30 hours a week if you have an open availability. Management is always changing in every department.
good,"You get paid great and people are good. It just depends on the department you work for whether your job is going to be stressful or not. Unfortunately I work in deli which is the most stressful section. Other than that, great place to work if you're looking for quick cash, just inconstant work schedule and inconstant hours unless you're full time."
good,"Publix was a great company when I worked for them. If it wasn't for the people met and experiences I had while working there, I wouldn't me the man I am today. I was blessed to have a great managers that taught me everything they knew and encouragement and help me move up through the company."
good,Would recommend to anyone looking to start a good career that has plenty of benefits and opportunities to move up with a company. Hours don’t really allow for much of a person life though.
good,"Publix has great benefits and stock options.  Opportunity for advancement is good as long as your test scores are where they need to be.  If retail management is your career choice, definitely consider Publix"
good,The department at my store was understaffed and management seemed to want to squeeze everything out of us instead of hire an extra person to help. The work wasn't terrible and we'd stock shelves for the specials then work through the back stock when we were done. My coworkers were really nice and enjoyable.  The benefits are great and the opportunities for advancement are fantastic although it might take you a while.
good,Everything revolved around team work.  Lots of opportunity for advancement.  Great benifits for medical and dental and optical as well as life insurance 401k and employee stock given for hours worked.
good,Deli life is tough. It is the hardest department in the whole store. Always in a customer service role. Management does look out for the associates when they need anything. Some times has associate appreciation lunches.
good,Whether part time or full time Publix is not a bad place to work. The employees and the customers are generally kind individuals and the work life balance is nice.
good,Deli department managers spend most days dealing with employee issues. Hardest part of job was covering for call outs. Store management good but corporate management could be hit or miss.
good,Publix had very flexible hours. The pay was good and there were plenty of hours for me to work. There were many opportunities to work in other departments and there were many chances for advancement.
good,Publix is an amazing job that provides great benefits to full-time employees and gives the option to all employees to invest in stock. Very caring coworkers and management.
good,"Working at Publix has been a great experience. This is my 1st job in US and I feel great. We, grocery clerks, work hard and against the time but we our department is one of the most paid, so you can guess what."
good,Depending on the department decides how busy you are but every department is constantly moving and doing something. It’s an overall okay place to work.
good,I enjoyed my time there and would (and may) work for them again in the future. Its like family there and the people make the job enjoyable. There are not many people there that act self important. It is a very service oriented organization.
good,"Good breaks free lunch"
good,Vey nice environment to come and shop and work. Also i loved how everyone had a real sense of paying  attention to detail . Also the managers are willing to help you if you ask questions.
good,I'm in college currently and they work with my schedule and give me a decent amount of hours. I wouldn't recommend working here full time if you're in school though. They make you work 10-12 hour work days as a full-time associate and they won't let you advance if you're in school.
good,"Everyday work was faced paced. I learned how to provide good customer service and how to survive a stressful work environment. The management is good, but it depends on how the management can be. The hardest part of the job was the dysfunction in the back room, but it is not like that for all Publix stores. The most enjoyable part of the job is the close-knit work environment and the customers."
good,"I started out here as an associate and I feel that I am treated and paid fairly. Even if I do not like my position, it is exceptionally easy to become promoted to management if you work hard enough."
good,"Learned great communication skills and customer service skills . Fun , organized , and clean place to work for . Management is great . Very active and energetic to work there ."
good,"Publix is a great company. I worked for them for a long time and enjoyed almost every minute of it. The culture that Publix creates is unmatched. The benefits are great, and so is the management staff."
good,Very good company to work for and get your foot in the door. Opportunity for advancement if you try hard enough. Managment is a hit and miss counting on the publix you work at.
good,very good place to invest your stocks has good benefits best 401k and holiday bonus can get very far once consistent and ensure your work does not go unnoticed
good,Pay is low. The hours are flexible and the managers are hit or miss. Always short on workers because they rather have you do 2 or more jobs in the 8 hours your on then to pay another person to do the job.
good,Publix is a great place to work especially if you're full time. Upper management is not a racially diverse as I would like to see. Publix has an excellent stock value and it's employee owned.
good,"I learned the most from this job than from any other job. I learned, most importantly, how to provide premier customer service. The management was excellent, as well as workplace culture. A typical day at work may include long hours and dealing with customers. The hardest part is being able to make the customer happy when they're screaming at you."
good,"Publix is a very busy place, especially in the Deli. They evaluate you every six months; if you score within their expectations or better they will increase your hourly pay, though it's not going to be easy work. "
good,Started at a store and moved to the distribution center. Work at both places was good. I would recommend to anyone to work at either place. I had no issues and only left to relocate closer to family.
good,Publix is flexible and the people you work with are usually super nice. I’ve made a ton of friends at Publix. The only thing is that Publix seems to hire all the time and everyone’s hours gets cut.
good,really great place to work at. pay is great and everybody is very easy going and easy to get along with. vacation days are good and work is not hard jus do do your job and you will be fine. free lunch is provided in a buffet style setting in cafeteria. menu changes everyday. save money by not buying or bringing lunch everyday
good,Everyone is moving at a fast paste due to you make more money the faster you are so everyone is fighting for money. So it could get stressful at times.
good,"When you hear about Publix people tell you they have great benefits, their hours are fair, they never fire people only relocate, and that customer service is excellent. All of its true but it comes with a whole lot of strings attached. Benefits, great but they are expensive and if you end up having to go part time you lose it even if you met the requirements to keep them you have to start over. Hours, if you are full time you can forget about having a life outside of Publix. You have no choice but to have an open availability and its never the same schedule from week to week. In my position they would always schedule me mid shifts which is usually from 10am-7pm, 11am-8pm, or 12pm-9pm. Customer Service, its actually mandatory that the customer gets whatever they want even if they are wrong or not. Also all of the charity donations through out the year its mandatory to ask every customer if they want to donate no matter how many times you have seen them that day. I think its too pushy but its whatever it takes to meet the store goal."
good,"Depending on who you are and what you want to do you may or may not succeed only because it is a Grocery store and its harder than it seems. if you can handle the heat and get work done and are willing to do whatever it takes to advance than you can do it. While it is a great place to work, its not best for everyone and they own situation. "
good,"Publix is a very secure company to work for. I started when I was 15, and quit at 27. I feel that I went full time too early and didnt give myself enough time for college. This is definitely a company that you can build a career at and you won’t have to worry too much about losing it. However, to me at least, seeing the same four walls day in and day out, along with repetitive tasks, make this job boring after a while. That is most of the reason I left. If you are considering, I would suggest looking into the Meat Dept. there is high demand for Meat Managers."
good,"I've learned excellent customer service. I've worked in seafood dpt,produce dpt,grocery dpt,customer service dpt and bakery. I'm currently in bakery. I've achieved the employee of the month in my first evalutaion."
good,Great company but had a terrible manager that lacked good manners and could not take care of the employees as promised by the company. She was not a team I would work under or encourage anyone to.
good,very enjoyable to work here! i made a lot of very good friends and the managers are all very nice and good to work with. the pay however was not very good and that is one of he reasons i didn’t go back.
good,This company really has no lack of exciting opportunities for all employees waiting around every corner. Can recommend especially if your a people person.
good,Great place to work if you enjoy working with a team. Management likes to take care of its employees. Every department works together in a cohesive manner and it’s usually a fun place to work.
good,I live in NC and we only really started getting Publix in the last 5 or 6 years and they are wonderful. Working there is great. For the most part I feel valued and well respected at Publix by both the managers and customers.
good,"Work days varied in consumer volume and tasks, there was a set list of things to do and every now and then something extra to be done. Direct managers were fine to work under, my immediate managers in customer service were great but did not care for the district manager., it seems like he tries to find things to get onto us about, and typically those were things that were inconsequential at best. Hardest part of the job were the dead hours, when people were out of town for an event or during work hours, our customer volume was sorely lacking. Overall though it was a fun place to work in and plenty to do if you knew what to look for."
good,"Don't get me wrong, Publix is an amazing place to work if you are a first-timer as it teaches you the basics and fundamentals about having and maintaining a job, but if you wanted to do anything besides being a bagger or cashier, you had to beg and plead over and over and hope that you get picked as a favorite over others, otherwise you will be sitting in the same department for years on end. Most of the management just have a smile on their face as a facade to make you feel like you're in a positive work environment, but most of the time that is a definite lie. If you plan on working here, only do it for about a year or two and don't try to make it a career unless you plan to be a mindless puppet and play fetch like a dog."
good,Publix is a great company for someone who is needing to build experience. They provide awesome job security. With Publix you can start off at any level and they provide great job training to help you move up in the company.
good,The job wasn't too stressful I got paid well my hours were flexible and I can do overtime when I need a little extra cash the customers we're very helpful but sometimes you would get those unruly customers who were kind of a trouble to handle but all in all the people work there were fine the job wasn't too stressful
good,The company is great it has good benefits but the management can be changed around most of the time  they work with you through any situation that you got going on . It's a great place
good,"No complaints.  Publix made a positive impact on my life, it gave me structure and a second home.  I appreciated both my workers and management.  Would recommend to anyone interested in Publix."
good,"Publix is very fast paced and competitive, but they have many advancement opportunities and the requirements are clear and made known to employees. Great working environment."
good,"Its a gret place to work, i just like more hours. I have been there for several years, and enjoy the people i work with. However I came from a background of unlimited overtime and we are not allowed that at Publix"
good,"Great benefits, hard work, competitive pay. They expect a lot from all associates but they reward those who work hard and get the job done. Retirement plans are good also."
good,Publix was a fun place to work I enjoyed who I worked with and the hours were very flexible. Very fast paced. Must be able to speak to upset customers.
good,"I honestly love my job at Publix especially dependent upon the people you work with, and the job will definitely teach you a lot and give you a lot of hands on experience with customers. In all reality Publix made me the out going person I am today!"
good,Great for a first job while still in school and living at home. Learned important customer service skills and how to work as a team in what can be a fast paced and stressful environment.
good,"I learned that Publix is a good place to work, it’s competitive, good coworkers,  job advancement, great benefits, stock options, the pay is decent. Thank you."
good,Publix is excellent for college students looking for long time work and benefits you wouldn't get at other jobs. However for people not looking to work there for long it is not recommended that you apply since you won't be able to access the benefits.
good,It was a fun job talking to customers and you become great friends with the people who work there because everyone is very friendly. The managers are great and understanding and it was a place that I would recommend for anyone.
good,I enjoyed my time there. They were very flexible with my schedule and everyone was like a little family. I never had any issues there. I would work there again
good,"I enjoyed my time at Publix, I feel like I learned so much as a pharmacy technician.  I also learned things such as scheduling and doing inventory and prepping for inventory.  A typical day would consist of me or another tech opening up, reading and filling any prescriptions, assisting the pharmacy in filling the prescriptions, and of course, ringing up patients.  I had gotten to the point of knowing my regular customers by face and would have their prescriptions ready to ring up.  The hardest part of the job was there was no downtime.  Not that needed it so much that it started to take a toll on my back and feet.  I enjoy my job and I think the most enjoyable part was the friendships that made coming to work a joy."
good,Great place to work. Great people. A great job to have while in school. Lots of great opportunities. Teaches you a lot about customer service and what it is really all about.
good,"Employees are allowed to work peacefully. No one puts pressure on them to complete a task quickly because at Publix, quality matters more than quantity."
good,I dont wanna type so imma say its all right.but thats about it the work in the deli is a bit hard tho so you better are prepared to work hard.ty for having me bye
good,The work environment for the most part can be rewarding and enjoyable depending on who you are working for. Most associates are friendly and willing to perform tasks with little opposition. Customers can be a handful sometimes but most customers are nice and friendly and can be rewarding.
good,When I worked at publix I liked everone there. My fellow employees and managers were always willing to do whatever it took to satisfy the customers and keep them coming back.
good,I’ve enjoyed my time there but it’s talking to long for me to get full time which I need and deserve I would say so I believe it’s about time to move on
good,"I had a great time with the daily work at Publix, I enjoyed engaging with customers and working with the stock. I did not enjoy my Produce manager, but the store manager was great."
good,"It is fast paced when busy but overall it is not much of a stressful job."
good,i liked it a lot because i liked the people i worked with. the job was stressful on sunday afternoons and weekday evenings but in general it wasnt too hard
good,"As a member of management, you generally work 6am-5pm (hours may vary by location) 4 days a week and are required to work the closing shift 1 day a week (generally until 1 hour after the store closes)."
good,"The days can be as short as three hours to 14 hours, depending the level commitment to moving up, your store, your position, your age, and your department. They offer benefits for all part-time workers. The level of benefits you qualify for depends on how many hours you work annually and length of employment (most benefits are available after 1 year). If you want to move up to be a manager making an annual salary, you can do it within five years without a college degree. It can be difficult to deal with people all day, especially since the motto is ""where shopping/working is a pleasure."" However, if you are a hard worker with a positive attitude, you'll do great and fit in just fine. The benefits really do out-weight the costs, and very few jobs offer so much opportunity to move up, get started, and succeed."
good,"This is a great place for advancement without any degrees in college.  You could potentially be a store manager making over 100,000 a year.  The downside is the irregular hours you work."
good,"good company promotes from within. You will work a lot of hours around the holidays. Free meals, the hourly associates are dedicated to the mission statement. Safety is a high priority."
good,Great place to work. I would definitely recommend working there. The overall workplace is fast pasted but it is manageable. If you need any help just ask your manager and they will be glad to help you the best they can.
good,"Worked at Publix for 11 years and it was a good place to work. Competitive pay, good benefits, free private Publix stock. Had many good managers and a lot of opportunity to grow in the company."
good,"I enjoy working at Publix, there is a good team atmosphere and the crew is fun to work with."
good,The job at Publix was great. The managers were approachable and helpful. They would help new associates learn the jobs asked of them. The most enjoyable part is the everyday interaction with the customers and fellow associates. The workplace culture is fun but also serious at the same time.
good,"Publix requires one to work with a fast pace and a lot of physical effort. However, I am treated with respect, and all employees are eligible to receive a fifty cent raise every six months if your job performance is satisfactory."
good,"Publix is a great company to start out in whether being a part timer going to class on the side like me or being a full timer. They tend only to promote from the inside if your intention is to move up. You learn valuable skills such as teamwork, communication, and time management. All associates tend to work together as a team to help others who are new or struggling. Hardest part of the job for me is the amount of work that needs to be done in a small time frame. Time moves quickly and you can easily find yourself coming up on the end of your shift with still much to do. The most enjoyable part is making friends with others like you starting out with their own story "
good,"Depends on what district you are in, but most management is pretty chill, as long as you do your job. The management is flexible and will work with you as long as you work with them. I get along really well with my coworkers, I'm friends with some of them and we hang outside of work. As long as you don't have too many hours, they will work your schedule around your needs, you can pick up shifts or give them to someone else. The shifts are pretty evenly split up, so your lunch will be right in the middle, where you don't have to work for long periods at a time. My coworkers are all different ages and demographics, so you get to work with all types of people. One of the bad things about Publix is the fact that part-time employees do not really have access to a lot of the benefits. I love going to work, because of my coworkers and the environment I am in. For the most part, the customers are super sweet too. I would say the hardest part is standing in one spot for a long period of time, and being tired, so sometimes you have to fake it."
good,Always had great people to work with. If you do your job well then career advancement has many opportunities. Paid a decent amount and compensated for the work you do for the most part
good,"Publix is a great place to work most days. But keep in mind this is retail and not everyday is the same. "
good,Good workplace for someone without a family. Your schedule is always different but if you can handle all that it's the best place to work! There are always advancements in all job positions.
good,"Good company to work for, They are fair and pay well. Enjoyed the time I have had worked there. Very welcoming and makes you feel like family, Would recommend them to my friends."
good,Publix is an excellent job to work at. You are given opportunities to move up within the company. It also comes with good benefits as well. I would recommend this place yo anyone who is looking to build a life out of the retail business.
good,Publix was an amazing job for me. I made great memories with great people who worked in an environment that always pushes the work culture forward. I never felt anything but pride when i told someone i worked for Publix.
good,"Fun place to work. Very competitive with the grocery department. I would recommend this job. The hours were good. Averaged about 35-44 a week, and the pay was good."
good,"With publix you have the chance to work hard and move up in the company. They provide full benefits and even stock with the company. However, it can be very stressful, demanding, sometimes you have to work double shifts if your in management."
good,"Great workplace, good benefits, flexible availability. Management is political with hiring and advancement opportunity................................"
good,"Publix is a good place to work and is also a good place to build character and to build work ethic as in getting used to how to do task in a timely manner."
good,I was able to increase my customer service experience.  I was able to learn additional work skills and experience by being allowed to cross-train in other departments of the store.  I was always being encouraged by the senior management employees to learn more by doing more.
good,"I was not a manager and just a normal grocery clerk. I got paid more because I was hired by a nice guy, but after he left the people after me got paid $1 less an hour even though we did the same work. "
good,Publix supermarkets has a very unique culture. A culture that makes you want to get involved and become part of the family. Publix have provided me with skills that are much need in life. 
good,"We care about customers and we care about specific employees. Overall good place to work. Managers are goal oriented and strive for those goals. Hours can change from week to week, due to working in retail"
good,Good vibes very friendly enviorment. Great for first job or career. Pays well to all ages. Offers variety of different jobs and gives you the option to cross train.
good,To make sure the store look nice .make shore ther costumer has a wonderful experience and make sure they have all the products they came for so they could keep returning to the store because of the service ther provide.
good,A typical work day is okay. I have conversations with customers and check them out and repeat. Sometimes we have to clean and that's okay too. Overall it's a nice place to work.
good,"Publix Was a good learning experience while I was in  Florida. A very busy store loved learning all the new items."
good,"Publix is a very good place to work, People in general are very friendly and treat you with the respect that you deserve. Very stable and successful company where the associates are well taking care of"
good,Every store at publix is different. Every department is different. I worked in customer service as a cashier. It had it's days were there were rude customers but it's a nice part time job.
good,"Busy bakery work, required being on your feet all day, lifting big boxes, cleaning, customer service. "
good,I enjoy working here because I get job satisfaction with the product I produce. I enjoy working with the managers because I learn skills that can carry with me for a future job.
good,"A typical day at publix consist of greeting customers, checking and monitoring prices of products as items scan, making sure items are properly bagged. if no customers are at the register, then I will move to the floor to see if customers need help with finding a specific product or have questions about a specific product. Also part of the job discription requires keeping a neat and tidy work place which includes making sure floor and register are clean at all times and stocking items on shelves. Management overall is great. The manager was always available when needed. He/She was always there for guidance and assistance. The hardest part of the job was trying to convince customers to donate to organizations associated with the company. The most enjoyable part was getting to meet new people everyday. Overall publix is a great company, there's so much you can learn from the work place."
good,Publix was a rewarding place to work because of the benefits and the overall customer service staff. I would definitely recommend this position to friends.
good,"It is a nice work place. Follow the directions and procedures to make the production. Engage costumers, provide information about products. Friendly managers. The hardest part is to make the customers happy, and the most enjoyable part is making the platters for parties and the look on the costumer's faces when receive the platters."
good,"Good place to work at as a starting job. Good pay, friendly work environment, communication. Majority of the customers are nice. A lot of couponer that come in.Reliable work place, gives you major holidays off and Christmas bonuses. Stock options, dental, medical, 401K plans provided after working some many hours. Tend to stand on your feet for long periods of times."
good,"nice environment to work, coworkers were friendly and schedule was flexible with my school hours. Location was convenient to my home, could get to work and home fast."
good,"Great company to work for especially if your start at a young age. They offer tuition reimbursement, stock options, health insurance, holiday bonuses, etc. Management and their hiring process could be much better but overall not a bad place to work."
good,"working for Publix is not a regular job, it is a culture, we are taught to be honest, respectful, always trained us about policies and how to improve our performance, positive managers and co-workers, best costumer service with a smile."
good,"On a normal day in the life of a Publix associate, you are required to come to work ready to work. Clean shaven, hair pulled back, clean pressed aprons and vests all ready to provide your local customers the premier customer service Publix thrives on. My job duties are not terribly challenging, however they may be cumbersome and very repetitive. "
good,Publix has a great culture and has very good job security. Moving up in the company is very feasible with on the job training and competitive salaries.
good,Family and team oriented when I worked here. Smaller location so the drama wasn't so big like in larger stores. Overall I loved this company and how they looked out for it's associates. I'd deffinetly come back if I could.
good,I enjoyed working at publix and was there about 18 yrs was let  go do to a misunderstanding  I loved  the coworkers and friendly atmosphere the hardest part of job  was to keep the temperatures correct ad the prep tables clean
good,"Can be stressful at times due to difficult customers and management can change policies often, overall fantastic starting job. Experience can vary depending on location."
good,working at publix its very fast paced for a selector you are running all day untill there are no more orders but the pay benefits and things like that are great. managers are very concerning
good,Really fast-paced environment… My coworkers were really nice and trained me really well… I enjoyed the flexible hours and we could always work overtime.
good,"In the beginning, I loved working here. Over time, my feelings have changed a bit about working in this store. The hours are generally based off of the previous year."
good,a typical work shift at publix is very refreshing you learn how to get in the flow of things quickly and the employees are always ready to work. what i learned at publix is how to move along with the pace of the customers for that shift. management at publix is very resonable and they respect and dont discriminate employees or customers. the hardest part of the job was figuring out my pace and adjusting to my new schedule. the most enjoyable part of my job was getting to exprience a new and improved work atmosphere as well as learning to not work alone but to work as a team because there is no I in team.
good,Publix is a overall decent company to work for. It is quite busy most of the time and keeps you on your feet. It taught me how to deal with different varieties of people. .
good,"Publix is a very fast pace environment and can be a bit overwhelming if you're not outgoing. The management is fair, the promote those who want to work pretty fast."
good,"Publix is a good company to work for with great benefits, stock ownership, and overall friendly work environment. You must have great people skills and the ability to NOT take things personally (from customers' complaints, etc.). Publix is very structured and family oriented. I believe it is over all a good company to work for!"
good,"Excellent place to work, however advancement could be better.  Flexibility of scheduling has been good and works in favor of the employee.  Publix has excellent benefits for a family."
good,Publix by far is an all around good place. They believe in Primer Customer Service standards and have a lot of good benefits and ways to reach out to their staff.
good,A typical day working here is extremely busy from the begining to the end of your shift. And what i've learned is that you must time yourself properly to meet random deadlines and scheduled deadlines. The staff is polite and work as a team. The hardest part of the job is keep up with the extremely fast pace. But the most enjoyable part of this job serving the customers.
good,"Publix is a good work place, and I would recommend it to others. The benefits are good if you stay long enough to reap them. Approximately, 3-4 years."
good,Publix is a good company for young people to build careers while meeting new people. I have a lot of good friends and supervisors that I have met during my employment.
good,"They have good Benefits and they also take care of their associates for the most part. "
good,always busy . you are always moving constantly on your feet helping customers through the store and to their car. management is always there to help . the hardest part of my job would be having every one work as one . the best part is that you become a family so its easier to make the day go by when you are working with friends
good,Being an outgoing person will help you go a long way in this particular company. Also if you are organized and diligent worker you will be given quarterly raises.
good,"Good to work for,they have a variety of positions.You have a choice of three shifts.You get three breaks. At the end of the year you get bonus pay. Other than vacation you get sick days."
good,It's a decent place to work. They work with your schedule so you can attend school or whatnot. Most of the people are friendly who work there and there are some not so nice people.
good,"I enjoyed working in this environment.  Working at a store isn't ideal for me, but the people I worked with were great.  There were of course some imperfections.  However, working in a great & positive environment was fantastic.  My supervisors and leaders were very helpful."
good,"I would love to say that it was an amazing experience... unfortunately i did not have that, the management wasn't great worked whenever they needed someone extra. Just was not a happy environment."
good,Management treat this place like it is critical and the world will end if one type of bread is sold out but some managers are less high-strung and fun to work with.
good,"A decent place to work, with an amicable ecosystem. Plenty of room and emphasis on advancement, and a robust set of benefits for full-time work. Definitely a good job, if you don't mind the monotony of the work itself."
good,I was a seafood specialist.. my job wasn't difficult. It was management in store that prompt me to quit. Would like publix to relinquish that beard law. Would like publix to be more customer interactive and treat employees with the same respect
good,"Yous schedule and just about everything else is conveniently available on line. Fast paced extremely customer service focused."
good,"Great customer service.  Wonderful benefits,  paid vacation,  401k. Flexible hours. Excellent job security.  Love working in deli department for 13 years."
good,"I am a people person. I bag their groceries and help them"
good,Worked as a bagger from August of 2013 to August of 2015. Has a great flexibility of scheduling for your needs of time being off from work and on how many hours you want to work. Safety is a big thing at this store and also provided premiere customer service is a must. Management at this store is mediocre and could use some improvement. Had a manager who never really scheduled me when I said I was available for 35 hours a week. The store is nice and clean and overall I would recommend working here if you are looking for a decent pay and a flexible work schedule.
good,"I have worked here for 7 months now and my schedule has never been the same twice. the hours are the only thing holding me back from making this a career. I would love to work here full-time but the hours are not there for our store. You go in, stock groceries and help customers, and anything else management tells you, then you leave.  The hardest part of the job is not having a consistent schedule.  Benefits are great if you get full-time, but other than that, they are just ok with vision and dental.  I love to work at Publix while in college but the sporadic scheduling and having to be willing to work any day of the week including Sunday is the only drawback, but it is a pretty big one for me."
good,"They continue to cut hours in the pharmacy department so it's becoming unstable and unreliable. Other than that, it's a clean, structured and organized corporate environment to work in. I am able to receive benefits even though I'm not a full timer."
good,"I worked for publix for 3 years, You deal with many different types of people on a day to day basis. However, for the most part all of the guest are friendly. I got better at dealing with customers, managing money, and communication. The management and the culture is fantastic. The hardest part was just complicated customers, but I enjoyed most of them."
good,"Working for Publix is what you make it to be. If you're willing to hustle to get the job done than this job is a piece of cake. Moving up in the company can be a little challenging but showing that you're wanting to move up and wanting to learn as much as possible about the position, things should go you're way with moving up. The work can be hard from time to time due to the amount of customers that come through at a time. The hardest part about the job would have to be if you work midnight shifts and having to get a huge truck done before the store opens. Although the job can be tough, you get a good feeling whenever you help customers out and seeing their reaction of gratitude."
good,Publix was my first job and it was a good place to work. If you are good at your job you get a raise every 6 months you are pretty much given job security unless you do something ridiculous for them to have no choice but to fire you.
good,For my first job it is the best that you can ask for. I have work there for almost 4 years and have enjoyed my time there. it is the best grocery store not only for customers but for employees as well.
good,Great place to work with great benifits.Lots of opportunities for advancement.Meals provided on each shift.Family friendly workplace. Proformance bonuses.
good,My review of this job was a good experience I learned a lot and now have more work experience I also learned the different types of juices and teas that we drink
good,It's a daily challenge working at Publix it's a fast paced always busy and hardly enough help to get some parts of your job done. Some days are better then others.
good,In my experience my complaints are minimal; my store manager was excellent at his job as well as friendly. Coworkers are very polite. Working there we were always encouraged to do our best and uphold our stellar reputation.
good,"I've been with Publix for almost 6 years now. Great for a part time job, some one fresh out of college/high school or if you've already been there for 10 or 15 years. 80% of the work force is part time and they prefer it that way, which means move up is slow and  difficult. However, you can get health insurance as a part timer, shrink and profit bonuses and stock options. When you have a wife and kids, house and car payments, and middle-aged, it's not a great place to work. Plus, should you get offered a full time position, they equate that to indentured servitude. I am looking for other work, but would still continue to work part time for as long as possible."
good,Worked at Publix for 9 years started out as a stocker and was promoted to Asst. Grocery manager with-in 3 years responsible for the overall look of the store.
good,I enjoy the positive attitude that everyone maintains at work. Excellent support from management at all times.Overall a great company to be involved with.
good,"not very strict mangers, co workers get along very well and free lunches everyday. they pay very well for the work that you do. fast paced environment and plenty opportunity for advancement."
good,It is great company to work for if your thinking long term other than that there isn't much to offer. Upside you get paid vacation that varies from how many years you work there.
good,Publix is a great place to work if you need a flexible schedule. While going to school they had absolutely no problem working around my schedule and to get me the hours that I needed. I'd recommend this job to anyone.
good,"I would recommend Publix to any person looking for a place to work, because Publix trains you efficiently. Publix also gives you several opportunities to be successful and thrive in the workplace."
good,"Very great Copan with great benefits also could make a career out of it if taken seriously, making it very easy to advance also big on community service and giving back to the community."
good,"Great work place but working there for a year and gave my all but still no benefits, raises yes, but I needed full time and benefits.This company will work with you around school schedules and etc. You can also move up to any other department with qualifications."
good,Good company to work for if you are willing to work long hours days. i dont want to write a full review this is short and to the point. people can walk in a publix and see how people work.
good,"Great place to work, wish I was given more hours. Management was choosey. Pay was fine, but management had to give you hours. Management could have been better."
good,"I love working there, I love working with the people but they're cutting hours for the part timer and getting 12 hours every week won't help me to pay my bills. I would I like to try soemthing new, maybe that will help me with my career"
good,Publix is a great place to work. There is always something to do but everyone helps each other out to get things done. I have really enjoyed working for Publix but I need a job that can better support my family.
good,"Love it here! Easy to do, however the pharmacy is always slammed if you can't handle fast place working environment then don't work at this location. But if you like fast paced atmosphere then work here."
good,"Publix can be a great company to grow in if you have the ethics and patience to stick around. It is a fast growing company that has a standing reputation. That being said, with fast growth comes the need for ANYONE to fill positions. quality is lost when you rush training and standards for hiring. Company is Employee owned and after three years, you have the opportunity to be part of the ownership. In the meantime it's the waiting game and putting up with typical standard retail workplace drama and run-arounds."
good,Overall the company has a ton to offer.  There are obviously flaws within the organization but overall I would recommend Publix to anyone who has the opportunity to work for them.
good,"Goof Benefits, But sometimes hard to talk to management."
good,Publix is a career job. From the bank to the benefits is enough hands down. The scheduling could be alot better but the long term benefits are way better than any other warehouse.
good,"Working at this supermarket has been a grateful pleasure of mine. The work is sometimes steady-paced, but mostly fast-moving. Everyone greets you with a smile, and we could always depend on another employee."
good,This place was very clean and a nice customer environment to work peacefully and enjoy the day. Even paced and not in a bad area. Co workers are very friendly.
good,Overall the staff and managers were polite and understanding. Very clean facilities that we easy to maneuver for all people. My hours were flexible and were easy to work around school hours. The pay rate was great for only being 14 years of age at the time.
good,"Overall a fantastic place to work! you have job opportunities that start at a young age (14 as a grocery bagger). It brings stress with it but only on occasion, no job will ever truly be stressless. plenty of job oppratunaties, and if you work hard and put the time in you can accomplish anything!"
good,"Publix is a good company to work for, do not get me wrong. It's a nice place to get your foot in the door and gain needed experience but beyond that there isn't much there. Management is not for everyone in the retail industry needless to say; for those that enjoy retail then they have the opportunity to move up in some cases."
good,"Schedule associates using OASIS system, run all front end duties assistant store management open and close store cash office fax email hire new associates"
good,"A typical day at work when you walk in the store, you greet all the employees at the store, and when you clock in you're designated to the customer service counter to find out what register you're stationed. When no customers present you stand in front of your register always being ready to greet them in your line. The hardest part of the job as a cashier is mainly just standing for very long hours in your shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you get to meet many different types of people as you assist them with their groceries. Publix's work place culture is that we each treat everyone in the store as if we were all a family. We provide them extraordinary customer service."
good,"Overall, this job is a great starting place for anyone just starting to work. It has excellent advancement opportunities and can very easily become a career."
good,Working for this company makes me and the co-workers feels like you are apart of this one big family that grows each year.
good,I've worked for publix for nearly 5 years and it was a great first job but advancement within the company can be difficult and I would like to widen my experience.
good,"This is a place where you could spread your wings, they are extremely supportive and give you all of the tools to advance your IT career. What I would say is a draw back is there isn't real clear guidance and uniformity in handling issues it almost feels like things are being made up as you go and I appreciate consistency."
good,"I worked for Publix for over 10 years. Overal I liked my job, co-workers, and the enviroment."
good,being a team player and working together meeting dead lines and hook up times for trailers cleaning are at the end of the shift also being able to laugh and have fun with co workers
good,"Excelente trato "
good,Public is overall a great company to work for. The benefits are great and offered to part-timers as well as full-timers. Must be able to work well with others and patient. Management works well will scheduling.
good,"I learned many customer serving skills and attributes from the job and mastered inventory organization and allocation. Co-workers behave much like a family, each taking their assigned task of the day with constant interaction with each other. Management for the most part was consistently helpful, but lagged in the actual work. I would continue to work here, but I would like to experience work more relatable to the fields I am interested in."
good,"Working at Publix was one of the best experiences I have had in my adult working career. They instill in you a good hardworking mentality, with in emphasis on making the customer your number one concern. The people you tend to work with understand the importance of consistency and team work."
good,Publix is a great place to make a career. It instills a sense of ownership and pride in its employees. They promote employees in store and also within supporting their secondary education in outside educational establishments.
good,"Publix is one of the few companies I have encountered who more than compensate their management with healthy salaries. That said, it is quite difficult to get advanced, doubly so if you have managers who will intentionally keep you in their own store because they don't want to risk losing strong associates to help run their department."
good,"Typical day at work, well Publix is primary my quick cash job while I was in college I recently graduate college with my Associates Degree in Computer Networking.  I realize its time to find something in my career and well also to make a living."
good,"professional atmosphere with opportunity for advancement, hard work for the money, understaffed a lot of the time. A lot of responsibilities, stressful at times.Nice customers made it rewarding."
good,"Publix is a good place to work. The employees and management are great, and you can really feel the customer service atmosphere. There are plenty of opportunities for advancements and great benefits within fulltime positions or through the 401k, which is matched up to $750 a year."
good,A clean Enviorment Good tasting Food a good hard team Publix provide for your family and that if anything happen Publix has the mean to meet your need.
good,Its a very easy job as a bakery clerk you will assist the baker in making food and you are responsible for packaging all food and labeling it for the show room floor. Also you a responsible to pull all stales at the end of the night and scan them out.
good,"Publix is a very hospitable company to work under, with a large focus on fostering good relations as a unit, family, and team. Outside of a few complaints about hourly scheduling as a part-time worker, Publix was nothing short of supportive and respectful."
good,"Work for Publix for four years, tried getting promoted and it's all a political game. Work is decent and pay is fair, made a lot of friends and lost some too. For all their preach of being a family or a team there is no one to enforce or even encourage it. Good for people who are fine working themselves while others watch. Lot of good people and plenty to learn as far as job experience. A job you love and hate in the same day. If you plan to career it isn't about being the best just who you know and what you are."
good,Management was a little rough because I had the same managers for almost 2 years and recently just received new management that none of knew so it was awkward at first having people in charge of us that we did not know at all. Most of the co-workers were very friendly and created great relationships. They were very easy to work with my busy schedule which no longer exists. I don't really care for the job though just because it isn't something I'm interested in for my future but they are super flexible with hours and that's great.
good,"Come in and put the newly arrived product on the shelves, then work the backstock to the shelf. After working all the product we would use handhelds to scan the backstock and empty product and review our orders for the next delivery."
good,"Great company to work for they relly care about you, they give you performance evaluations every 6 months which includes a raise which is nice. Also they only promote from in the company which is good if you want to make it a career."
good,greeting customers all day and treating them like the king and queens was the name of the game working here. learned customer service is key to success
good,Being a cashier is a great job to have. Working with customers on a daily basis will help improve your customer service skills. Also constantly handling money at a register will show that you can be trusted around money
good,"A typical day at work consisted of filling customers prescriptions, ordering more medicines and supplies and ringing up customers. I learned how to fill prescriptions and use the system to find medications and to order supplies and medicines telephonically. Management was awesome, I had the opportunity to become friends with the pharmacy manager at the time and we're still friends today. My coworkers were okay. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with one of the pharmacy managers, he always made the job fun. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customer who felt entitled."
good,Typical day is constantly busy and work left unfinished. Makes day go by fast. Learn about customers and relationships.Too much learning to list. Some managers are supportive some not. Deli and bakery managers must be hands on. In the deli co workers have to be team work orientated to get job tasks done in required time frames. The hardest part is leaving work unfinished. Must be multitask individual and know how to prioritize tasks. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know customers.
good,"as a deli clerk a typical day consisted of preparing the meats/cheeses for the sub station for the day. After that, making sure everything is clean inbetween customers. if a customer does come make sure their needs are met. always with a smile, because honestly this was one job i enjoyed coming to work daily. slicing,cleaning and interacting was all in a days work. closing up was a task washing and wiping everything down and making sure everything was presentation worthy for the next busy day"
good,"I began at Publix almost two years ago, bagging groceries. I don't bag groceries anymore but make about the same as somebody who does, after two years. The pay here is generally terrible. I know somebody who has been a Publix associate for about twenty years and only makes around twelve an hour."
good,If you work hard you move up. they are strict on how you treat customers. Best place to work as far as management staff and the people you work with. Easy to move up if you work hard.
good,enjoyed a focused and productive team. Company provided excellent benefits. Managers were supportive and helpful. Culture was one that emphasized team work and productivity.
good,"I have enjoyed my time with Publix.  There is plenty of opportunities for advancement, with the biggest downfall being the heavy workloads during holidays and weekends."
good,"I started working here in High School and continued into college.  They are really great in allowing you to be extremely flexible with your schedule, particularly as a part-timer.  They give you regular raises every six months and have decent pay, though the pay is far from great.  As a part-timer, the only real benefit you have is stock options. Though, the stock is really great.  Publix seems to be very cutthroat when it comes to advancement in management, and it seemed that no one was there to try and help you up the ladder. If you do ever get into management then it is a very lucrative career."
good,"Publix is a great company to work for, with great benefits , They are also very flexible with your schedule and they are family oriented."
good,"Publix is a good company  Its has good benefits and good employees, I enjoy working with co-workers and helping customers. but its same tasks everyday.."
good,Enjoyed working there.  Had a misunderstanding of hours.  Could not work until 11:00 p.m.  But did enjoy the interaction with the customers.
good,"-Very intense physical labor"
good,I have worked for publix for 20 years. I have worked in both the deli and bakery. its a great company to work for and great company to shop at.
good,"My typical day at work is very demanding work, but enjoyable. I have learned how to balance time along with how to keep a strong work ethic. Management is always professional and maintains the stores well. Co-Workers are usually nice and pleasant. The Hardest part of my job is the constant labor. The most enjoyable is the co workers you meet along the way!."
good,Everyone is great and it actually feels like a workplace family. Co-workers were there to help if needed. Best thing is coming in knowing it was going to be a good day.
good,"I work well with the customers and I can easily create customer connections. I work with papers, money, computers, phone calls. I deal with customer complaints on a daily basis. I've learned what makes great customer service and the skills to make it better."
good,"Main focus would have to be the customers. We are there to satisfy them and make their shopping experience a pleasure. The job itself is not hard and it is a fun atmosphere. Most everyone gets along and the management cares about you personally. They try to help any way they can, work related or not."
good,Publix is a great company to work for if you enjoy being around people. I would recommend the job to anyone who is a people person. The benefits make it all worth working for at Publix.
good,"Working at Publix overall is a great job. The work place is professional and fast paced. Multi-tasking comes in handy for numerous things. As my first job it has taught me how to have great customer service, how to handle problems in a professional manner, how to help customers in what ever they need and also to be organized in my working area. The hardest part of my job is not getting the hours that I need to support my family. The most enjoyable part of my job is engaging in friendly conversations with my customers and have friendly relationships with them."
good,Publix was a fun place to work. The people that work there really do care for the customers and want to serve them. Unfortunately management would overwork good employees with inconsistently placed breaks and inconveniently placed hours. Customer Service workers are also expected to clean the floors at the end of the night with outdated equipment (possibly 30 years old) that would break often while on the job.
good,"Publix is a fast-pace environment. Managers that believe in you help you move up successfully into Management.  I was a Cashier for 9 years moved to the bakery and became a Baker in less then 1 year. I have been a Baker for 3 years and trying to become an assistant manager.  The co-workers I work with are wonderful.  You work with people from different backgrounds, you learn a lot about your co-workers.  The funny thing about it, is when you transfer to another store you have the same personality but different people in other Publix's.  The hardest part of the Job in the Bakery is keeping up.  Anyone that calls out, puts a lot of pressure on the rest of the team. In the Bakery, we have to Bake/Ice & Decorate and it is time consuming. We make our Bread from scratch, our cookies and pastries are baked daily and the cakes are decorated and made daily.  The most enjoyable part of the job is Customer Satisfaction."
good,Great opportunity. Hard on the feet and back with heavy lifting. fun group lots of public service participation and very community oriented.
good,"Publix is a very friendly and relaxed place to work. It has a warm environment that welcomes anybody. Publix main focus in on customer service, making customers happy and welcoming them back. Publix exceeds in Customer Service"
good,"A day of work at Publix starts off with what job roll you are assigned that day or that time, such as cashiering, bagging, coordinating, customer service, etc. As a Customer Service Staff Representative, I was to cover all of these job rolls and any other tasks my managers or team leader gave me that day. The main thing is to always provide the best customer service and to make sure every customer was taken care of and more. Every associate at Publix is to work with one another as a team, and this was always great when you worked with a peer that you considered a friend as well because it made work that much more enjoyable and your day go at a good pace."
good,"-Exciting place to work and the different departments is a plus because you have a variety of options if you just don't want to be in one department"
good,"Compensation and work benefits are great, including advancement within the company and also job security."
good,"Each day there is a Game plan to be followed and all tasks are structured. Tasks involve assisting customers, reviewing orders, stocking shelves, overseeing associate productivity and general supervision to maintain company standards. Management is average 50 hours a week with a varied schedule. Co-workers are friendly and easy to work with and the hardest part of the job is getting on a set schedule and making plans outside of work. The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting customers and working in a family-oriented atmosphere."
good,"Publix is a pretty decent place to work. A typical day is just standing in one spot doing monotonous tasks while providing premier customer service to the customers. Management was decent, they would always push you to be better and treat the customers the best you can. The co-workers tend to stick together a bit and help each other out when they need shifts covered. And the hardest part was probably just the fact that the job isn't a challenge and the job is only worth it if you try hard to advance...and if you do then you will advance."
good,"It's a great place to work depending on the staff. There are good benefits and you can personally grow and develop. The hardest part is dealing with angry customers but, it is a rewarding job."
good,"its a great company with amazing benefit for part and full time. I wish they would give us a break after every 2 hours. but other than that, it  fun place/great place to meet people."
good,"Publix is a good company to have a career at, offering many benefits that only a employee owned business can. Publix even gives you free stock for working there. But Publix expects a lot from it's employees. So as long as your willing to work hard, it could be a good fit. The only down fall was the managers. More often than not, managers have there own agenda and will step on anyone to move higher up in the chain. I had to quit because when my new manager did not like me, she started an awful rumor about me and another manager, and it got so bad I was forced to resign."
good,"A typical day would be to set up the deli in the morning,wait on customers,receive product,merchandise product order for the next truck and supervise associates. I learned how to organize my time well. I most enjoied interacting with customers."
good,"I'm currently a customer service representative. My typical day would include either managing the customer service desk (handling all customer needs), managing the front end (managing and leading the front of the store making sure everything goes smoothly), or working the back office (entering day to day financials on the computer and closing the store). "
good,Ok so this is another job that your going to either love or hate based on you manager. I've had great managers and other manager that Micro manage everything.
good,"Arrive on time and start my day. Prep food,clean area and cook then serve the warehouse at dinner time making sure they got what they needed. Management was alright for the most part.  My co-workers was a joy and handful at times but overall I enjoyed working with them. The best part of the day was hearing the workers say the food was good. I think the hardest part was not having all the ingredients to work with. The best part was ending the day knowing you did your best."
good,"its a good store. Unfortunately,I Had to Let it go due to relocation, But all together great work environment. From the workers, To the community it is a great place to start a career. And make a powerful impact in your future."
good,"-Merchandising"
good,Outstanding group of grocery industry professionals. Great mentors who develop high standards of business operations & help to grow leaders who are very successful.
good,"A typical day at Publix consists of assisting customers locate different things through out the store. Also I have to use problem solving skills in order to keep customers happy. The hardest part of the job is when you are faced with an angry customer and have no way to change the way they feel. The easiest part of the job is the actual tasks I have to perform like, keeping the store clean, the shelves stocked, and completing my job."
good,Publix is a great place to work but unless you plan on moving up in the company you will need a second job. But they do have a get retirement plan
good,"Working at Publix was very consistent in the duties and tasks fulfilled. Very rarely was there a curveball thrown into the equation, and the same tasks were generally repeated every day of work. I would bag groceries and provide customer service to customers, assisting them in any way possible. This proved to be monotonous at times, but it at least provided a bit of routine in my schedule to keep things consistent."
good,Team work is need to accomplish everyday tasks and always a positive attitude with excellent customer service. As well as great organizations skills will always make the daily work load easier and flow better.
good,Working at for T-Mobil was an excellent experience . I got a chance to work with customers over the phone. I had the opputunity to make my customers smile without being present.
good,"Overall, I love Publix. Great pay and benefits. I haven't always liked the management, but Publix is way bigger than the managers. You are usually guaranteed 40 hrs., some departments grant OT. The work environment at the warehouses can be very drama filled. The work can become mundane, but you have the opportunity to be cross-trained in other areas."
good,"As a Asst. Customer Service Manager I oversaw 80-100 associates on the front end, promoted a positive work environment and promoted premier customer service. In my position I learned how to run payroll for the entire store of over 100 associates, I learned how to write performance evaluations for every associate in my department and also performance raises. Wrote schedules for every associate in the customer service department. The hardest part of my job was the long hours. Working in retail you worked sometimes 13-14 hour days and early early mornings and late nights and every holiday and weekend. The most enjoyable part of my job was the wonderful people I got to work with, all my associates and fellow coworkers and also interacting with all the customers. I am a people person and enjoy working in a team environment."
good,love my job everyday is a new strategy you grow with customers relations
good,"Awesome work environment, but like every job, management can either make it or break it. Publix as a company is amazing with great benefits and stock programs. But the managers can be a bit dehumanized by the training program and turn on you in a heartbeat. The district manager has TOO much control, and can really make work completely unenjoyable."
good,i loved my time at publix. i was a kid and the pay was fair for a bagger and would not recommend if you are looking for a career in the art of bagging. but i left publix for wal-mart which was a big mistake and will always regret that but when you are young any job seems awsome.
good,"From this job I learned just how crazy some people can be. Sometime you just can't make people happy, but at Publix we always tried. We would have good managers and sometimes we would have bad managers. My favorite thing about working here was being in the ""back office"", this was where the safe was kept and where we counted money for the end of day account. I really liked being in the back office because I had a routine of how I did things and I was at my own pace. Things didn't always go smoothly, but I loved the puzzle of figuring out what I could do to fix things that needed to be fixed. I absolutely loved the people I worked with, we were all like family."
good,"Store 0890 is a fantastic place to work. I get along well with all my coworkers and the management is willing to work with their employees. Every day my managers are right there with us employees performing the same types of tasks as we are."
good,"very busy but sometimes slow, co-workers are team players. The most enjoyable part was the face the customers make when they are satisfied"
good,I mostly work at nights. I run the Kitchen part of the Deli. which means i have to fry the chicken and wings. the hardest part having to tell a customer that we no longer have the product that they are looking for because it disappoints them. But i really enjoy seeing the look on most customers faces when they get the service and products they deserve.
good,"Publix is an outstanding and incredibly stable company. Upper management is very methodical. My team was incredibly creative, and we worked very well together. The workload in my particular department was often challenging, bu the people make the difference."
good,"It's a great place to work management is wonderful, your coworkers there are a handful you may come across that give you a hard time"
good,"great place to work and be a manager, after 5 years i am struggling with work home balance. also working more than 6 to 7 days in a row without a day off."
good,The work environment is always given the opportunity to be made into a great one. One has to take it upon themselves to do that however. The work days range for me from 5 A.M. To 11P.M. Management has it's likes and dislikes just like everywhere else but more likes for sure. If you want to advance there is plenty of chances to do so if you are willing to put the time in. Management is required to work 50+ hour work weeks. Overall a great company that gives it's associates it chances to move up and succeed. Great retirement benefits and Employer Stock Program.
good,"The typical day involves customer interaction, meeting customers needs and maintaining the meat dept as well as assisting other customers with their needs."
good,Selectors work independently. Get paid by percentage. Co-workers are friendly. The hardest part of the job is the constant lifting.
good,Working at Publix can be fun if you enjoy what you're doing but if you dont like the department you're in i recommend you switch departments cause it isnt going to get any better. ok pay.
good,"I loved working for Publix, it was a great experience, and I would love to stay there but I would much rather make my way out of retail."
good,This is a place where the pharmacist can develop a friendly atmosphere with the customers and give great service. The company is highly organized and technically advanced making the job enjoyable.
good,"Resloved customer complaints"
good,"It was a nice place to work, and job security was never an issue as long as you did the job you were payed for."
good,In a typical day I resolve various receiving and inventory issues. I've learned the importance of each position and how they relate with each other. The management and co-workers work together to create a safe work environment.
good,"a lot of cusomers, you dont have time for nothing"
good,"Publix is a great company to work for with excellent benefits. The company takes pride in its product, service and employees. With the culture and integrity of the company, it will continue to excel against competition and remain a success as it has for over 70 years. My only concern with the company is its disregard to an individual's personal time. Working for such a company is demanding and if not a passion will be a torturous environment (due to long work hours/days)."
good,depending on you job the day all end up the same. each day your wanted to complete the job in a time safe manor.
good,"There was a day I went to work, although I was new, but I was called upon to operate the forklift. I did not know how to, but my manager taught me.It was a good thing because now, I am a better operator."
good,"Publix will take care of you if you fully dive into the company culture. They have a great benefits plan for all of their employees, and are very accomodating when it comes to work scheduling."
good,"Great place to work with a well implimented culture, but have to put in time and be fulltime worker to benefit."
good,"selecting products to send to the stores,management very supportive , team working skills.hardest park was the schedule"
good,"I had a good time working for publix, friendly co-workers, most caring company I have worked for so far. The reason I left was because I was in need of a full time position with more pay."
good,"Awesome job to have, not a place if you want a high paying job but will eventually pay off in the long run. Thats when you start making money after a year."
good,Learned a lot from working here. A great place for advancements and opportunities.
good,Just get burnt out form doing the same thing everyday for over 10 years feels like a dead end job if you are not willing to relocate to another area .
good,"Great advancement opportunities, great job security and advancement opportunities. Very stable company and good work schedule. The mangers aren't usually nice though. I've worked at three different locations."
good,"Working for Publix is a breeze. It's impossible to get fired and coworkers are great(depending on location). However, it's also impossible to advance unless you're a favorite. The best part of the job is the 401K and the quarterly bonuses the worst part is not having a set schedule."
good,"Associates are motivated to represent and facilitate the company's values by providing premier service to all customers regardless of age, class, or the size of their grocery order."
good,"A typical day at work includes signing into the register, processing large volumes of groceries, fulfilling customer requests, bagging groceries, keeping the store clean, keeping the parking lot tidy, bringing back carts, bagging groceries, assisting customers to their vehicles with groceries."
good,I've worked at publix for a long time. it has it's days where i like it and other days where i don't like it too much

good,"Publix is an amazing workplace and gives everyone the opportunity to grow and become the best associate possible. Their benefits are bar-none, and their stock is great!"
good,Publix is a fine supermarket with a wonderful benefits package and good pay rates.
good,"I loved the fast pace and the challenge. I enjoy working under pressure and believe that rewards are earned, not given. I received a raise and advancement within a year and definitely felt like a part of the Publix family. The only downfall is that there was a lot of unnecessary drama and the coworkers were from all walks of life...if you know what I mean. Overall, its a great job...just hate standing for a consecutive 8 hours."
good,Company provides greats great benefits once you qualify for them.
good,Customers were walking away completely satisfied with their shopping experience and then you know that they will be coming back again.
good,"A typical day at work was great, it was friendly you were always encouraged to do you best , you got to interact with a lot of different people and i made a few good friends ill have for life."
good,"Publix is a great, stable company to work for.  Most of the time you will deal with great people and learn a lot about the company."
good,"Learned about diverse people and cultures, hardest part of job long hours, customers were most enjoyable part of job."
good,"I loved Publix and everything the company stood for until I moved from Florida to Alabama. The employees here are only out for themselves and they don't care who they have to throw to the wolves to get what they want. The deli manager at my store would throw parties and supply alcohol to underage employees who would show up to my department unable to work the following day because they were hungover, that is if they bothered to show up at all. And lates and no shows were accepted but if you put the wrong date on a piece of bread you get a write up. The store manager will believe people underneath you just because they party together."
good,"Its always busy at publix in a typical work day. I learned how to bag groceries and stock shelves or level the shelves."
good,"Every day I was responsible for my aisle plus whatever else needed done. I completed these tasks by bearing down and getting the job done.  Top notch organizational skills as well as a strong work ethic are what made me successful at Publix.  I appreciated the ability to let my supervisors know of any concerns that I may have had as far as the efficiency of the company went.  They were receptive and allowed me to work in the manner that I thought was best, which ended up rendering the best results."
good,Great place to work and the benefits and advancement opportunities are great.
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced, helping customers & seeing familiar faces."
good,"I work in the grocery department at Publix. I am part time and work on days when we have deliveries. Are truck ranges from 800 to 1200 pieces three days a week. On truck days I work the cereal isle. While working the truck we block the isles, fill specials and provide excellent customer service to our guests. I've become an expert at dry grocery items. What's healthy for you, what isn't. Most cost effective items. What tastes, good what doesn't. Easiest items to cook and prepare etc. Management is hit or miss at Publix, but I've been blessed in my department and have had managers and supervisors that know how to manage. My coworkers have always been a fun bunch. A great mixture of people from every age, race, creed, and social class do what I do. Hardest part at times is the physical demands of the job. Pulling pallets of water. Lifting boxes of detergent, walking clear across the store to show a guest where the bread is. It can become a long day if you can't meet those physical demands. Guests visits our stores because they know we provide a high level of product quality and customer service. Guests enjoy their visit when we meet those levels. Simply seeing that is fun and rewarding.  "
good,"Good work environment "
good,"I have acquired a number of skills in areas of food handling and preparation, maintaining good communication with everyone, meeting different people from varied cultural backgrounds and learning to appreciate their good qualities."
good,Really enjoyed working here. Everyone was treated like family
good,"Publix is a top ten Fortune 500 company, so needless to say they have a few good things going for them.  Customer service is instilled in you the first day you become a Publix employee and never goes away. There is something as simple as greeting someone to making sure special orders are fulfilled for every customer. The benefits at Publix are phenomenal, they have a stock program, and most important, Publix genuinely cares about their employees. "
good,A typical day at work for me was bagging groceries and getting carts. I learned what it meant to provide quality customer service and work hard. My co-workers were great and helpful. The hardest part of my job was getting carts when it was really hot outside but i did it with ease. The best part about my job was providing great customer service and making people smile. 
good,It was my first job in a warehouse. We worked hard but we made money.  I will never forget my co workers.

good,solid grocery company that care about consumers You work with professional environment
good,"I work as a produce clerk, and my job usually consists of putting out fresh fruits and vegetables onto the shelves as well as juice and other products. The hardest part of my job is keeping up with the tasks at hand while constantly stopping to assist customers because I work at a very high volume store and sometimes products fly off the shelf faster than I can put new products out"
good,It was a very fast past job with very little time to spare but i enjoy that type of work because you got to be a team player to get the daily task done. Me and my co-workers had to work together to be successful.I learned how to work independedly because management was not always around
good,The people and the standards of the companey was great the typical day at work was I managed 8 loaders to ensure that the frieght was being loaded correctly on the trailers before being shipped out. Management was very supportive. I hardest part about the job was the weekend with the employees calling in. Most enjoyable part of my job was when it was my long weekend to be off
good,- Interact with customers and provide excellent customer service
good,I love Publix. A typical day at work is talking to customers and scanning groceries.
good,"Plenty of chances for advancement, fair treatment by mgmt, everyone maintains a pleasant attitude and you get a share in the company just by working there."
good,This job is really secure and offfers a lot of advancement. Many of the managers started off at the bottom. The benefits are great and the jobs are really easy to do.

good,publix is a great place to work with th oppertunity to transfer jobs within the company
good,"A typical day at Publix for me would be counting large amounts of cash, making tills, daily cash drops and deposits also change orders, making sure my cash office remains balanced all day.On free time i would help with bagging groceries carring out customers to their cars, help with customer service if they were backed up at the counter which would include western union, ticket master, money orders, answer phones, and deal with customer complants and refunds and exchanges. My co worker were awesome we all were not just a team but family and we work togather to get the job done with the best customer service we could provide.I enjoyed getting to meet new people and just all around helping customers get what they needed to make there day better and faster and with great customer service."
good,"Cake decorating, place orders, package bread, stack shelf"
good,"Typical day: Cashiering, helping customers. Giving the best customer service possible."
good,"The working was great, but the workload could be a little heavy."
good,Being in the stock team i was one of the ones to make sure the store floors stay clean for the next work day. The benefits they give after the year pays for the stuff i would need in life. With hours if u needed to work a little mor on hours the would give u.
good,Always room to advance. This company is very organized and ever changing however the technology is behind. In my years with Publix I have noticed that the different districts are ran differently it should be unified across the board.
good,"When I work overnight at publix it's restless,hard working people that I work with, the work place is friendly,the most enjoyable part of my job was being there and the management did what was necessary to succeed."
good,A typical day at work (in the bakery)  consists of lots of production being made and a great deal of emphasis on customer service. Have to be willing to help customers with a good attitude and quality products. It is sometimes hard to keep up with all the requirements of the job. Holidays are tough and you often work long hours. Benefits are good and there is many opportunities to rise within the company. Management does very well financially.
good,"A typical work day at work is great. Employees are able to learn methods of great customer service, proper procedures for product and prevention plus and conflict resolution. The work place culture is diverse and family oriented. Work life balance and team work  is very important. The hardest part of my job is staying self motivated after receiving my check and you are constantly thinking about the bills you can not pay until next week. All employees rely on each other to stay self motivated to meet Publix's' customer service Goals. The most enjoyable part of my job is the family oriented environment and seeing a customer smile after asking did you find everything ok. Customers come back and make sure they come through your line or ask for you just because they know you will take care of their needs. The customers smiles keep me motivated not the pay. I do not want to leave."
good,Publix is a great company to work for and  we get a lot of good benefits from. Publix has given me good benefits such as dental and vision aid and retirement plan is an option.
good,It was a good place to work. Management was sometimes extremely difficult to deal with. Overall it was a good experience. I still have good connections there.
good,A typical day at work was usually busy with really bad rushes around lunch and dinner times. I learned how to step up and make sure the people around me are getting what they need to done. The management in the Deli was the best but the store manager at my store stressed people out so much that they started transferring or quitting and that made it awful for the people we had left.
good,Publix pays every week. Publix has bonuses every 6 months. Depending on the department they give good raises. Publix has competitive pay.  Publix has stock that you are able to part take in.
good,"Great place to work, my job was at a standstill. I would recommend the company to anyone who asked. I just needed something different. A fresh start elsewhere."
good,"Management staff was extremely helpful during training and made the job easier. The only bad part about Publix, was its flexible schedule. Sometimes you will have to close one night, and open up the next morning."
good,Publix always is one of the best to work management is really good and respectful and i have a great experience if i have to go to work there again i will in a hearthbeat
good,"Publix is a great culture and 100% employee owned. Publix also has a great set of benefits which include paid sick time, paid vacation, and stock ownership plan."
good,"Great company to work for if you're looking for part time work. If you want full time, you should be prepared to go into management. Managers typically work 45+ hours per week."
good,mellow normal days and busy holidays. Standard grocery store experience. Sometimes customers are bonkers and the company’s bootlicking “customer is always right” thing is irritating.
good,"Typical day is productive and fast paced. Must be people oriented, friendly, and flexible. Workplace culture is great! Hardest part of the job is certain departments can put a lot of strain on your body. Most enjoyable part of the job is working with people and helping customers."
good,"Great company to work for with great benefits and opportunity for advancement. I've seen many quiet, soft spoken introverts come out of their shells and become more comfortable with communicating."

good,"If you happen to live by a publix and are interested in the retail/grocery industry then this place is pretty great. They listen to what you want your schedule to be like and are very flexible. I personally had a great manager. They try their best to chose the most qualified managers, which most of them are very good at filling that position."
good,its a great place to work at for your FIRST job other than that you don’t wanna work there unless your looking towards management.Its normal to be a fasted paced in the middle of the day but it overall medium pace throughout the day.
good,As long as you take care of the customer and want to you will be fine. You can move forward with the company really fast if that is what you want to do.
good,It is not hard to learn what’s required of you and how to constantly do more to preform better. It is a little inefficient by a good bit of the workers. But that is just another way to be better is to increase your own efficiency
good,I’ve learned how to work with the costumers and help them with what they need and also providing premium costumer service. I’m a cashier at Publix and we have people from different cultures so it’s easy for me to be able to speak Spanish and English so that way I can help most of the costumers. The coworkers are really nice too.
good,This location paid very well. They are very flexible with hours which I love because it helps me be the student I am. I created not only friends with this company but also family.
good,Publix is good company and the benefit is great. It has flexible hours you can work. It have retirement benefit and stock. You can advance up to be an assistant manager or management.
good,"Publix was a great company to work for, and while there can be some issues with work/life balance (especially for managers) it was an overall positive experience."
good,"you get what you put into Publix. they take notice of hard work ad opportunities to advance with the right attitude."
good,Enjoyed working for Publix. They do offer good benefits with stock options. The drawback is the schedule. The schedule is not posted until Wednesday for the week starting on Saturday.……………………………………………………………..………..
good,"Good Company if you like retail. However, if you are in college or in trade school you have better options than retail since it is at times demanding. The best part is retirement benefits because having private stocks is like a pension."
good,Publix has a family culture. The company cares about it’s employees. Take care of them and they will take care of you. They will help you to advance your career within the company. Publix also offers plentiful benefits.
good,"In the five years I worked for Publix, I learned a lot about retail and customer service. I learned to work hard and efficiently while providing superior customer service. It also granted me the opportunity to work with all kinds of people of different professional backgrounds and work experience. I learned to be a team player and to give back to my community through volunteer experiences. My coworkers became like family to me while simultaneously maintaining professional integrity in the workplace. Publix is usually my go-to recommendation for anyone looking for a retail job. It goes beyond what other retail jobs are offering."
good,"Working in the deli is a bit more than I was expecting. On our busy days we do not have enough employees to greet all guests and assist them as they should be. It is a routine job, and you mostly do the same things everyday."
good,Typical day at work it’s usually very busy can slow down at times but it gets right back busy. It’s very busy on weekends. You can get good hours but I’ve noticed that if your not over 18 you won’t get that many hours by the most you will work 2 days maybe 3 if your lucky and management likes you. Hours per week being under 18 will be 5 hour or less and if your lucky you will sumtimes get 6 to 8 hour shifts
good,"My overall experience with Publix for the past 2, almost 3 years has been nothing but positive. I have enjoyed my time working there as an associate and continue to maintain that job and advance while searching for another job."
good,"Publix always has new managers that all have their own way of running things. Some of them make you eat, sleep, and breathe Publix. Whatever you do, don’t let the managers walk all over you. That was my problem, and it almost resulted in me not graduating."
good,"I did not get enough hours, they were constantly cut. The pay raises were decent and every six months but again the hours weren't worth it. The actual job isn't hard and you get the hang of things quickly."
good,I've worked here for a Year and a half. It's a good place to work and if you get full time you get good benefits. Right now im part time and i need something more stable and with better pay.
good,"PUBLIX is a great place to work. We meet many different people since we’re in a tourist location. It’s a fun fast-paced environment and requires some multitasking. Generally the people and management are nice. You can get a little overwhelmed or stressed at times because few of our customers are not nice. Or when, you have unexpected amount of people call out. All in all, I would definitely recommend! There is room for advancement if you work hard of course."
good,Everybody comes in with a good attitude works hard as a team player and learns as much as possible from the Publix handbook dealing with several different lead managers at different times it's kind of difficult but the pay and the benefits are excellent it is a great place for a career an opportunity to move up in the company as well
good,"The people that dhop there are usually cery polite, and you co-workers treat you well. Its a clean place to work in and it has a welcoming enviroment even for people woth no experience"
good,Constantly moving with something to do every minute of the day. Opportunities for advancement from within the company is always available as long as you work hard and adopt the Publix culture. Ideas
good,Well more organized. Treated well. Managers highly motivate their staff. Encouraged alot. Amazing friendly atmosphere. Many benefits provided at Publix. If there was a Publix in Missouri I would still be working for them.
good,"Publix is a great place to work. They are happy to accommodate for individual needs. It is face-paced for the most part, but that helps the day go by quicker. The associates all joke with one another and are very friendly. The hardest part of the job is the toll it takes on your body. After working more than 5 hours, your knees and feet start to hurt. I'd say the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to see my coworkers. They have become my friends."
good,Environment and associates are great and work together. Some days get to you but nothing one can't handle. overall it really is a great company to work for. You'll make great new friends and coworkers.
good,I did everything there from clean bathrooms to run the store. I lead a great group of people over 22 stores and hundreds of associates. My time there was spent smiling and working hard. It is a great 27 year experience and they paid me very well to do my job.
good,Publix is a great to work. The employees are nice and the work environment is accretional. Some days may be stressful but overall you can find help anywhere you can..
good,"I worked at Publix as a front service clerk and stock clerk. I bagged and was a cashier, and also stocked. If you get your work done, you won't have any problems. I only ran into problems because of a certain few mangers, but otherwise had no issues."
good,"A great place to work. Very flexible when it comes to your schedule, you pick what days and hours you are available. Opportunities for advancement and overall a great place to work. Management is good but changes from time to time."
good,The most enjoyable part about Publix is working with many different kinds of people all working towards one goal.  I have learned many new things in the business aspect.
good,I do like working there very much.  There are other employees are very helpful to the customer.  Merchandise are in a neat order and very clean. It's hard to find help if you out sick.
good,"I work in Publix 5 years, weeks days, I learned in this company about time work, about customer and rule - customer is always on the first place, that is place where people learned about culture, contact, comunation with customers, about smile, because, smile is very important for any, special for this job. Publix is company where work and shoping is pleasure, where every day coming to many customers, thousands and thousands and where you have to always   working hard, where you have to pick up shoping car when is rain, cold...Not easy but if you work with heart it is ok. But, in the Publix you never safe about work hours, same times ok, same times little hours per week, but I understanding reason for that."
good,I liked working at publix but however they are somewhat strict on certain things.  But they pay was great and my hours was good.  I had to leave because of the distance and I couldn't work mornings anymore
good,5 star place to learn management skills and hands on experience with working with customers .  it was always awsome working for a company that appreciated the things i did for them and our customers.
good,An amazing company that offers endless opportunities for advancement in the company. Only thing that will keep you from being successful here is yourself.
good,"Great place to work. You build many close relationships that last long after one had left the company. Fairly treated, but still a corporation that worries about image"
good,Publix is a great place to work and usually up to date with changes in the area. They could use some help in the amount of hours they give their employees. Some part time employees are only given one day a week.
good,"My overall experience with Publix was great.  My managers were very understanding about my scheduling needs and my department really felt like a family, like they advertise.  If management likes you, and they will if you do your job and do it well, they will really go out of their way for you.  I was offered advancement in the company multiple times but turned it down to puruse college.  Being in the stock department was extremely physically demanding.  I do not recommend if you are not looking to put in the sweat."
good,"great place to work, especially as a first job, great benefits and flexible hours. the most enjoyable part of the job is the benefits especially the stock options."
good,Publix is a great place to work with very caring managers that will accommodate your work/life balance. My manager was always making sure we did a safe and productive job.
good,If like to work hard and be acknowledged for Publix is the place for you. They Promote from within so as long as you do your job well advancement is possible.
good,"Managers and shift leads rarely had your back when facing a customer, and shift leads especially would make you feel looked down upon, and make unwarranted comments about you or your work, while acting in a way that hindered or inhibited you while you were on the clock. Shift leads especially were mostly unhelpful, not wanting to assist you with things you weren't able to handle, one in particular that I worked with always came in with a bad attitude no matter how you worked or how nice you were."
good,"Is a great place to work, you become family there.The benifits are good.Love getting to know your regular customers and being able to help them when they have a problem or need to special order products ."
good,"Working at Publix is as they say, like a family.  You get to know everyone in all the departments, and the treatment of employees fosters genuine concern for your customers and pride in your store."
good,"Publix is a company that truly is whatever you want it to be. It could be a part time job, a retirement job, or a career. If you put enough hard work in, most managers are really good at recognizing that hard work."
good,Public is an amazing place to work with loving customers and coworkers. If you are the type of person to keep to yourself certain locations are not the best for you because you get scored basically on the coworkers feel about your personality (it affects whether or not if you get a promotion).
good,Of course that can give me at least 30 hours a week because I need to pay my classes and books and help more myself makes My family happy and see how it goes hope I can get a job here
good,Publix A good place too work where shopping almost became home I learn a lot there unfortunately I had to leave because the scheduling became to inconvenient my hours were getting cut other than that great benefits treat there employees well.
good,"I loved working here it is a great job, good pay, and it is like working with family. I worked for the company for almost three years and enjoyed all of it."
good,"I was in a very busy store and stayed very busy."
good,Company transitioned to using computer programs to dictate all activities managers are responsible for and has led to a more stressful environment as the programs are not as accurate as a good manger can do without them
good,"Overall Publix is a great place to work, however, how much you enjoy it depends on your work ethic, career interests, if any, & willingness to learn. For those whom have the ambition, Publix can be very rewarding."
good,Overall a great company to work for and very flexible with scheduling and providing hours. Everyone there is friendly and supportive. I love the customer first culture over there.
good,"Certain people of authority may target you and not like you for no reason and will treat you differently, and/or unfairly. It is a great place to advance and increase your pay."
good,"There's always lots of work to do on any given day and holidays are incredibly busy. The company structure allows you to grow through the company from any position so it's a great place if you want to stay with the company for a long time but you have to push for advancement and change stores as you move to management."
good,"Publix is excellent! The managers are great. They act as if they are one of your coworkers, instead of a higher power. The coworkers there are phenomenal!"
good,"I liked working at Publix. It was a great vibe, excellent coworkers, and the customers would join in on the fun as well. Taught me how to advance in my customer service."
good,"I like working at publix is just the benefits sometimes are bad, and on top of that is hard to get full time, or a well payed salary, sometimes they don't even appreciate how hard you work or how much effort you put into your department"
good,Publix is a wonderful company and every store is different.some stores are easy and others are more challenging. The key is to understand that Publix sets you up for life. The benefits are key.!
good,absolutely loved working here. the company as a whole is Great. everyone was always in a great mood and energetic and it really makes going to work a joy.
good,Publix offers a constructive environment to learn how to properly carryout the job while being flexible with employees' extracurricular activities and school. Management is always willing to work with specific schedules and accommodate to those who need or desire extra training.
good,Job provides great benefits and a very flexible company to work for. A day in the bakery is very fast paced and one has to work with the public constantly.
good,It is a Great place to work. The company has Great benefits and work environment. The hours can be demanding but the pay is very good. I would recommend.
good,"If anyone needed an in-between job, or wanted a starter job, I'd recommend Publix. Managers were all good and fair and had all been in our position. They would often contribute to a task if we were falling behind. It's tough adn takes some time to get used to, but if you aren't doing it as a stop-gap for something else you can in fact move up from the bottom and get some very nice management positions (in a decade or so...)"
good,"Publix was my first job.  I went from bagging groceries to department manager.  When I started, I had not intended to stay, but  I planned to leave once I had my degree.  I did not leave, though, due to my fathers health situation.  By my eighth year, I had been promoted to Produce Manager. I worked there for over 20 years.  My job as a manager was often difficult, as it seemed I could not keep quality associates. I was happy to see them being promoted, but I often found myself short handed.  In order to make up for the shortage of help, I would work from 70 to 100 hours a week.  I finally had to seek a new job, as I found myself missing too much of my family life, and all those hours were starting to take a toll on my health.  Still, I look back on my days at Publix with much fondness."
good,I was working the grocery department. I had an ok manager but I had a great crew that I worked with. They taught me how to be a great stock clerk and to make sure that the customers were taken care of need wise.
good,"The best for a young persons 1st. working experience. A Strong fountain for your future."
good,"On a typical day at work, I would come in, clock in, and go talk to a manager to see where they want me to be. I would bag groceries, help customers out to the car (if needed), and kept my work area clean."
good,"Great place to work, lots of advancement potential. If you work hard and show initiative, you can move up quickly.  Great benefits, stock options and bonuses."
good,"I've learned a lot in my previous job how to with your co-employee, boss and customer. Always accurate specially in handling money which I could say that my boss had given me a full trust and confidence in all my work.  Trained other employee how to be fast and reliable and trustworthy. And also you feel the customer like you because you give them good service and a lot of people know me in good way that brings joy to me."
good,"I enjoyed working everyday with management and thier straight work ethic. Each job is detailed and defined by the management; they are specific in the job assignments. However, they are not difficult to perform them. Each job assigned is graded through out each day. At the end of 3 months the jobs are assigned a number and at that job number the assignments creates a raise or stalemate as to the place-ment of a movement into the next job level."
good,all of the people there were really nice and fun to work with. The management was often too stressed out to the point that they could become harsh and/or belittling. Generally a fun place to work.
good,"Working at Publix is rewarding, but it can come with drawbacks. It can eat away at time you put aside for life outside of Publix because they are able to schedule 40 hours a week of your time however they choose and sometimes those schedules can be a little hectic."
good,"Everyone had clear job duties and worked together to accomplish the stores goals."
good,A wondeful company. You make a family while working here they take cate of their assoicates. They do as much as they to help you succeed. Overall publix is a wonderful company
good,"Great company to work for.  I would go back. Great leaders, scheduling was very accommodating. Was able to to learn other depts. not just my own. I would recommend to others."
good,Publixs is moving in a fast past going up north opening up new store's lots of ways to move up and go from state to state meet new people. Publix will pay for relocation.

good,I recommend publix as a job for high schoolers who are unsure of going to higher education because it can be a good start to a well paying career. The stock options are a plus as well.
good,"Publix is famous for their job culture, their many opportunities for advancement, and their friendly staff. The only downsides really are that it's not the most impressive job starting out and as an adult if you don't move up quickly then you really can't support yourself very well."
good,"I enjoyed my time there produce was awesome, the people you meet make your days. Co workers are amazing, they are always there to assist you. Also publix has great benefits"

good,They always kept me busy with work. I enjoyed working there and maid lots of friends. I learned lots about responsibility as well. You would usually bag groceries and gather carts.
good,"It's a good company for a person who wants to build a career with since they promote from within, different departments have a lot of opportunity to grow with. If anyone decide to move up for management it would be possible specially if your manager are very supportive but your social life will be limited to less as to the job requires you to be on your feet most of the time day or night."
good,I highly enjoyed my time working at publix. The other associates were like family and they were understanding when it came to personal matters. I would highly recommend to my friends working for publix.
good,Many a time within the publix deli will you face hardships and controversy. Never forget you are there for the customers and most problems will fade. A sense of humor is key to survival.
good,"Publix is a very good place to work. I use it to make extra money. I don't feel like I want to climb the ladder there, so I am looking elsewhere. Publix has a good working atmosphere."
good,Publix is a great place to work whether it's your first job while in high school or you are planning to make a career out of it.  They offer great benefits as well as many opportunities for anyone who is willing to put in the time and effort.

good,"This was my first job in high school, stayed for 4 years and would still be there if one was in my area. "
good,Fui aprendiz por mais de um ano e a gerencia super confiavel e compreensiva. Em datas especiais como pascoa e natal tem bonificações.
good,"Good company to work for. Work days are repetitive, hope to have a good crew. The company is more business oriented now, asking for more of its employees for less. I have learned life is too short to be angry about out of stock goods and ugly produce."
good,great company overall to work in. Management varies from store to store. great chances for advancement within the company. a lot of friendly faces in the team
good,Publix was a great company to work for. There was great people with competition for management and growth. I loved it and hated it because there was so much work to do with such little pay.
good,"Great place to work!!! learned how to provide excellent customer service, Great management; associate relationship. Will always recommend this company as one of the best!!"
good,"Publix is a place with great customer service but, its a shame that they don't allow talking between co workers the only time you can really talk is when in front of a customer and that seems like a flaw to me because you cant seem to do your work and get to know your co worker. and because of that its led to miss understandings between friends of mine."
good,Publix is a great place to have a first job. The flexible hours of part time employees make it so school and work can easily mix together. Moving up to salaried positions is rather difficult however. You really need to personally know people that will be hiring you for corporate jobs to stand a chance at getting one.
good,"No complain but the salaries..."
good,"Publix is an awesome place to work. It is absolutely the best first job for anyone. The culture is great, the benefits are fantastic, I don't know what I would have done without my coworkers and management behind me."
good,"Great place to work with primary focus being customer satisfaction. A typical day consist of prepping and handling food in a timely manner to ensure customers request are quickly met.

The culture they have instilled since the early 1920's is one that still holds true till today."
good,A very clean and well organized place to work. Stores are usually fully staffed and customers and associates are pleasant. Benefits and hours of operation are great too. Closing on major holidays is nice in retail and rare.

good,I enjoyed working here and loved the ability to get to know people and as well as being able to travel to Florida and work in the summer months. It was an awesome experience.
good,"Publix is a good company to work for; they provide excellent benefits (even if youre part time), associates and management are nice, and you can easily move up the ladder too."
good,Depends on position hired for but most of all is a busy day throughout the entire day for everyone especially dealing with customers use to receiving a high customers service from the store itself. In the end pleasurable to shop and work.
good,Good place to work. Great staff and great training. I also like the how they work with you to provide a schedule that fits other activitys through out every day life
good,"Great Benefits- Health, 401k-matching, free stock, free meals. Great employees, strong workplace culture. Employees take pride being part of Publix. Management is decent, they recently started promoting managers with little experience and it is noticed. A lot of roam for growth and job advancement. Overall a great company!"
good,"A job is a job. As an employee, you will always come across drama from not just your coworkers, but also from your managers! Surprisingly enough, it is very easy to stay out of the drama when you mind your own business. Always treat everyone with the same respect and dignity, and it will remind you exactly why you started working there. It is an awesome place to work. You meet a lot of new people, you get well paid, and the job security is awesome. I felt like family at Publix and was so sad when I had to leave. If I wasn't going to be a nurse, I would have made a career working at Publix."
good,"Publix is one of the most well rounded places I've worked for. My day to day routine is full of hard work, laughter and happy customers. I've leaned how to hone many different skills thanks to very supportive management and associates. The hardest part of the job would probably keeping up with the rush when we're short handed but even then, management does their best to provide us with the tools and people we need."
good,"easy place to work managers are easy to talk to and are willing to show you how to do something if you don't know how to do the work"
good,Working at publix can be a great opportunity for someone looking to grow with a company. The pay is not bad and they offer a lots of benefits for people who work full time.
good,"Publix is a fun place to work, but don't let it get busy.  You see all types of personalities.  If you are good with people, you will be able to manage it well."
good,"Worked in a sanitary plant that required constant removal of jumpsuit and wash down when leaving/entering the plant production area.  Although, I understand the importance of this process, it became something I did not enjoy doing."
good,A great place to work at good benefit great supervisors good security they feed you for free they give you good days off at a time they give you vacation
good,Great place to work if you need a part time job. Good for students who need flexible hours and a moderate salary. Management is usually accommodating and the work needs little previous experience.
good,"They treat customers and employees very well and it easy to get promoted, if you want that opportunity. And also great benefits. Every one works together to get the job done."
good,Very fast paced environment with enjoyable people to work with. You get very close with your customers you see usually on a daily basis. It helped me get knowledge with problem solving questions and required much attention and you had to be aware of your surroundings.
good,"I've worked in great stores, I've worked in terrible stores. Ultimately it's all the same, but when you lack a team that doesn't care about their job then that's a problem. If you have a team full of staff that care and are willing to work diligently and a manager that knows what they're doing, it's absolutely great."
good,"A typical day at work, well, there is no such thing in retail... The tasks such as filling and dispensing prescriptions, counseling patients, performing DUR, contacting other health care providers, following the guidelines set forth by state and federal laws, etc.- those are the daily backbone to work, but one comes across many interesting situations, problems to be solved, co-workers to be encouraged and supported.  I have learned a significant amount of ""people skills"" in the retail environment, know how to talk to people from many different walks of life and have learned to appreciate when a desired outcome to any issue is arrived at in a win-win situation.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a wonderful staff and being involved with our customers.  Publix prides itself on customer service, and I firmly believe every successful business venture in retail hinges on that foundation.  I have been glad and proud to be part of that."
good,"Publix was my second job. i thought it would be hard and i would hate it, but i soon found out that it would be the best job. I had just moved to a new city and met many friends at work . It was great experience and if i had not moved out of state i would have stayed there until i graduated."
good,It's a great company to work for. The benefits are outstanding. I would highly recommend that you put in an application to work here. Everyone is friendly.
good,My typical day at Publix would be to clock in and go on my assigned register. I would treat my customers how I would want to be treated. Management is ok.
good,"Typical retail pharmacy practice. High paced environment, long hours and many points of patient care contact with insurance companies, nurses and physicians.  Always a hard working day.  I do enjoy the gratification of explaining certain medications in correlation to the disease state being treated to a patient who many have not have fully understood the information provided with in the physician office environment."
good,A fun place to work with great benefits. Very nice fellow employees. More managers than associates in certain departments.
good,"Been here 6 years and have been blessed to move up multiple times. "
good,"It has its rep. for a reason everyone there is good, helpful, team oriented, and a great place to work. From the customers to the co- workers just great."
good,Every job has it's up's and down's but honestly Publix has taught me so much I wouldn't trade my experience working here for anything. Publix can go from a part time job for extra cash to a career for  anyone willing to work.
good,"I loved working for Publix and in the deli specifically. Customers suck as with any work place but the job itself was easy. I only left the job because I had a second child. Now that I'm working again, I plan on trying to get back in with Publix."
good,"I would coem in stock lunch and meat and cheese, help and asssist in the meat department and close the seafood down when its time to close. I also used pallet jacks, organize backstock and put the stck on shelves everyday of the week."
good,"They truly care about their employees, hence the awesome 401K and stock. The co-workers become your family. Managers don't speak down its more of a place of teamwork."
good,Solid company with a lot of advancement and growth opportunities. Management is invested in the growth and happiness of its employees
good,Not enough help at times not willing to hire. Good breaks and the benefits are outstanding. Its a good career. Demanding and held responsible. Good in raises and great with customer care.
good,Publix is an excellent company to advance for someone whom wants to learn the field of marketing and management and work their way up from clerk to management. Excellent benefits such as stock and 401k.
good,Great place to work! clean stores and focused on customer service.Tons of opportunity for advancement. they're willing to work with hours and understand that family comes first
good,"public is a great job. pay is ok. a lot of benefits. you learn a lot working there. it is a little boring and they are strict but, it has been proven that publix can make you rich if you make it you profession."
good,"I gradually become a better person by working for Publix. I learned how to interact in a busy environment in a positive manner as well as      preparing myself for the adult world. The associates are friendly and are willing to help out one another and serve customers. The customers are very friendly and relaxed when shopping here. When I work hard enough, I am recognized as a good employee. Managers are very nice and are willing to help out both customers and associates. If you are young and looking for a starting job, I would highly recommend Publix."
good,"its a fast paced job, I working with a lot of people who are motivated to get the job done like I am. provide customer service by greeting and assisting customers, and responding to customers inquiries and complaints, when it's hard to resolve the issues it gets a little difficult at times, working hard and turning a negative to a positive is always the best part of my day benefits"
good,"I really enjoyed working their. The employees are extremely nice and polite. I never had an issue with anyone. I've learned so many tips as working for customer service. For example, how to speak to a customer, make sure they have everything, and always ask if they found everything okay. Whatever problems they have we can fix right away. In my opinion there was no hard part of the job. Very easy going and understandable."
good,"I enjoyed going to work, and seeing my familiar customers. They always made my day with they're smiling faces. The management was good, and my coworkers were like family. The hardest part of the job was trying to please everyone, even the ones that you couldn't please no matter what. I just really enjoyed working with my coworkers, and with the public."
good,"At Publix, I have learned how to adapt to new positions I had been trained for and to figure out what to do in situations that the training did not prepare me for. The management is great most of the time while each manager still has their weak points. Most of the co-workers are who I would consider today to be family. The job is not hard in and of itself. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing how I can make the customers happy."
good,"Working at Publix has been a great experience. I've learned so much  over the pass 4 years. The management is really good, co-workers are fun people. It just has been absolutely wonderful."
good,Publix offers a great and positive workplace environment that is advantageous to career advancement and enjoyability.  Whether you are looking for a part time hourly pay while in school or a fulfilling and rewarding career Publix is the place to be.  Publix has a way of making you feel like a family not just a workplace.
good,I loved working here! Everyone was so friendly and helpful. Nothing but encouragement from the managers. Great first job for anyone.
good,Everyday consists of making sure the staff is making the customers feel at home and treated as top priority. Customers see us as food experts and rely on us for our honest opinions and facts about different products throughout the store. Management and staff each do their part in making the team. Everyone has ups and down and since a family oriented business everyone knows how to work with each other and resolve situations as a team. The biggest up and down is when having to work on multiple situations and once that deals with customers staff and public. But all in all learning is something everyday we all learn and develop skills.
good,Working at Publix Supermarkets was a pleasure. Work was fun and the hours flew by. While my time there was short it was obvious to me opportunities and advancement was inevitable. Sadly studies demanded too much of me and I decided to focus on High School.
good,One of the best company to work for. Friendly environment all the time and the customers where like family. The associates would always work hard and keep a smile on your face. The only problem was the management. We were always running out of supplies and we would have not enough help to complete the task we are suppose to do on time.
good,"Overall, the company itself is fantastic place to work. There is great opportunity for advancement. The pay is fair and you are given the promise of biannual raises, so long as your work ethic show you to be deserving of such a raise. The most enjoyable part of this job was to be able to interact with and help customers on a daily basis."
good,Publix is full of friendly people people. they are always smiling and willing to help. the job is really fun and exciting with plenty of room for advancement. the hardest part of the job is the lifting and the standing. Co-Workers are great but management not so much
good,"Mostly busy days taking care of customers, and even if there was no customers, there was still plenty to do. "
good,"First thing to do when I walk in is to put away anything to distract me from my job, next I head to the clock to punch in and head to my area assigned to me for that day.  Next I begin work starting from the hardest working my way to the easiest blocking all distraction so by the time its time to clock out I could already be done my working and start assisting my coworkers ."
good,"Great benefits, good working environment. good customer service. overall a great place to work. I would highly recommend to all my friends and family to work for."
good,Management is supportive and the job is easy. Filling the specials and making sure the isles are ready to be shopped are the main concerns of this job. You also will be unloading trucks and working some truck if your manager assigns it.
good,typical day would start off with a safety meeting and stretch out  to get everyone up to speed after we would start our shifts and work up till break time and lunch.
good,"I enjoyed the Guidance Publix had given me as a teenager, and the opportunity to grow within the company if it is chosen to take. If my path wasn't with Allied Home Mtg. shortly after, I would've worked my way up into the company and still be there today."
good,"Great people. Typical day includes long hours on ones feet. This can be tiring; however, the people make it worth it. Management is typically good."
good,"It is a very challenging yet rewarding job constantly striving to provide premier customer service. Everyday is a new adventure and you always encounter something new when you come into work each day which is part of the things I really enjoyed.  However, I did not enjoy the constant pressure from management."
good,"A typical day working at Publix is busy and there's always something to do. I learned time management skills, great customer service skills and the importance of teamwork. Management was top of the line and very supportive to other associates. My coworkers were kind, welcoming, and enjoyable to work with. The hardest part of the job were the random hours associated with retail. I enjoyed the strong team work and friendly environment."
good,"I was a Front Service Clerk at Publix for almost three years. The job consisted mostly of bagging groceries, ringing up customers, and cleaning. The job was simple and easy, but it taught me a whole lot about customer service and being professional at work. I enjoyed working with most of the people at my store."
good,"I worked at Publix as a stocker. I was on time for work every single day and came in with a great attitude, my manager liked me and even gave me other jobs to earn extra hours. The hardest part  of the job for me was having to stock the shelves almost immediately after restocking them, as water/milk/eggs tend to clear the shelves quickly. "
good,"Publix is one of the few retailers that give part timers full benefits (like health insurance and 401k). Most of the workers are genuinely nice people, ready to be friends and help when needed. Many of the things I have learned at Publix was processing Money Service transactions (ie Western Union) and Lottery Sales. The hardest part of the job is when there is a rush of customers. Imagine preforming 20 different tasks all at the same time with a swarm of people around you all impatiently waiting to check out and go home. The most enjoyable are the holiday associate dinners. The entire store's associates get together and cook for one another. We also have an annual anniversary dinner that the company hosts for its 5,10,15, and 20 year veterans."
good,I was working in the bakery and in customer service . im always upscaling a product . helping customers with their every need. anwering phones handling money.
good,"Publix is an incredible work place. The customers are friendly, the associates are amazing and the management I have worked under made the place a  good balance between work and humor."
good,Room for opportunity and advancement. Most of the people are personable and would recommend as a good work place. Great benefits from this company.
good,"Great place to work with flexible schedules for part time associates. Open door policy, always a manager on hand to listen to concerns. I've enjoyed the past 10 years of being employed with this company."
good,Friendly place to work with a supportive team and accompanied with great management.The most enjoyable part of the job is working with other cool associates and getting to know people in the area.
good,Great opportunities for advancement and you own stock in the company you work for. Bonuses are every three months. They are closed three holidays every year. The pay is fair.
good,"a typical day at work is hot, helping customers with groceries outside of the store. Publix has a friendly enviroment jgkfldjgklnbmldfhjogkdfj,kbm,lsnjfklhg"
good,It was a pleasure working for this company. Management really cares for your well being and you health. Publix allows you to buy stocks in the company and they will also give you.
good,"My days with Publix are always fun. All my co-workers enjoy the time spending with me. I have been working for the company for 8 years, i find it easy. I am an easy going person."
good,"The managers kept it fun and there was always something new to learn. Another job where you become family once you are hired. The only problem was that Publix has started to take away some of the greatest pleasures that employees loved doing. For example Holiday fest. Everyone would get dressed up and we would have a huge meal and celebration for the employees and customers. They have stopped doing that for budget cuts, but it was one of the greatest memories that I have from when I first started working at Publix."
good,"A typical day at work begins with a start up meeting updating and informing us of any changes occurring, and providing us with the workload of the day. Working for publix teaches you a lot about punctuality, hard work, and reliability. The managers are very active and try to be personal and understanding. The co-workers are publix enthusiast and work hard."
good,"Publix has a good Reputation."
good,"A typical day would consist of checking out customers and having good conversations with regular customers, stocking and pulling things to the front on the shelves. I learned to control the volume of my voice. the hardest part was not getting a lot of hours but I had to deal with it and keep going."
good,A typical day at work would be clocking in and beginning your shift and making sure that the customers walk in/out happy.  I learned many new things that I feel are essential for future jobs.  It helped me develop my communication and problem solving skills.  The management were on task and made sure they had as many people working each lane as much as possible.  The co-workers were very friendly and supportive.  I would say there wasn't really much of the job that was hard at all.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be seeing the customers happy when they leave and giving you compliments.
good,"Working at Publix has been a joy. I've gained great costumer service skills, I've also gained skills in grocery. Publix can be a great place to work only if you apply yourself. With hard work you can go very far with Publix."
good,"The best part about my job were the people, both the people I worked with and the customers. I really enjoyed interacting with them and not only did I get to manage so many wonderful, different men and women, but I learned so much from them as well since my Management title was official at a younger age."
good,"I See Publix as a family market, there is a lot of benefits there for people to come and shop, the workers are really nice and conduct they're selves as proper employers."
good,"*I learned how to handle stress and deal with other people's problems/questions throughout each day."
good,"The hardest apart of my job was keeping up with the customers, constantly frying chicken or putting vegetables in the hot bar but it was the most frequent job I had in the deli. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers, I always tried to at least get a smile out of my customers mostly because if they leave smiling they will come back smiling. A typical day at Publix i will admit was not easy, I was always in the kitchen cooking or helping someone who was cooking while trying to lead the people that were engaging with customers. While at Publix I learned a great work ethic and also learned that a great work ethic is something that constantly has to evolve in order to maintain the level of workmanship that was expected of me. My management team was very helpful, coming to help me and my coworkers whenever we needed them but lacked the ability to give a complement when the department did a good job. My coworkers were stubborn and would sometimes quickly get angry at one another but would not take it out on the customers."
good,A typical day at Publix requires customer service all day from the time your shift starts until your shift ends. Bring in carts from outside make sure the workplace is clean and organized. I learned to provide customer service skills to customers. Also how to deal with different types of customers ranging from easy to get along with to difficult to handle. The co-workers were very fun to be around but you either got along or you didnt. Management is very strict but depending on where you are located management can change and be different for everybody. The hardest part of the job is having to take a difficult situation and always making it positive and having to stay positive throughout the day no matter what. The most enjoyable part of this job is getting to know your community and putting a smile on customer's faces.
good,I enjoyed working for Publix. Good company with opportunity
good,Working with so many people of all different styles of life made this job fun and easy but also made me want to come back for more. i could not get enough hours because i just loved to talk to the people and be there for them when they needed me. The hardest part of the job was the difficult customers but i was very good at talking with them and making them happy. the most enjoyable part was defiantly the smiles because i made it my personal goal to make as many people happy as i could.
good,"Benefits are GREAT, management was GREAT, pay was ok, just could not advance fast enough."
good,"My work day was fairly simple. Between bagging groceries I had one or two half-hour cart shifts. I worked many night shifts where I swept and learned to run a floor machine. At night I sometimes refilled the bags and cleaned each register. The managers were somewhat demanding, but not too difficult to deal with. I worked well with my co-workers and made many friends. The hardest part was having a cart shift during inclement weather. The most enjoyable part was organizing shelves with other baggers and cashiers toward the end of each shift."

I learned to organize employee lunches and closing chores. I like my managers and the majority of my co-workers. I enjoyed talking to new people everyday and engaging customers with communication."
good,A great place to work to meet new people. Management were very helpful and understanding.
good,"A day at publix consisted of picking out a good ""ride"", which is a pallet truck or forklift, depending on your job responsibilities for the day. From there you get your designated area and as trailers bump the dock you start working. Management really allowed you to work at your own pace as long as the work was completed and you got the numbers that you were suppose to get when the day was done. Co-workers would be very helpful and motivate you to do your work and do it well. We would sometime compete with each other to see who could unload the most truck during lunch or for the entire day. There was no hard part to the job really it just became challenging on busy days and wet weather. The most enjoyable part was just knowing that you were making a difference and meeting a quota and getting things done. Not to mention the co-workers weren't bad everybody got along very well."
good,"Customer service development very solid with Publix."
good,Publix trained us to take care of our customers and associates. Every day was enjoyable by our interaction with each other. Overall the management was ready to help us if we had questions or concerns. My managers and associates were fantastic. It was a family away from home. My job was very rewarding and I have no complaints about our team or the company. 17 years with one company speaks for itself.
good,Shifts were always run smoothly and in order. Everyone always did their job and their part. Management was always their to solve problems and help. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers.

good,"At first, it is an incredible challenge, but, if you're qualified and dedicated, Publix is an incredible and fun place to work.  No matter what position you are in, this company will bring out the best in you and challenge you in ways you never thought possible.  I honestly believe you will be a better person if you succeed at this company."
good,I love the fact that they are customer service based. That is there number one priority.
good,"Wonderful  training programs. "
good,"Publix offers a weekly paycheck and daily breaks depending on your schedule, of course. I mention the breaks because i don't receive any where i currently work. I can say that not all companies are equal and Publix is the best of the 3 companies for which i worked for."
good,"- Always something to do in order to stay busy"
good,"Good pay Long hours, you work hours go on the store demands."
good,"Typical day would include interaction with customers purchasing or searching for groceries. I learned how to become more tactful including persuading customers to try new products. Management was respectful and assisted when needed. co-workers varied but more often than not pleasurable to work with. Hardest part would be dealing with a rude customer especially if they were in the wrong. Most enjoyable would be the work hours, and establishing mutual relationships with customers and their family."
good,"A typical day at Publix includes cashing out customers orders. The management are supportive of employees and there is ample opportunity for advancement. Co-workers can range from very young, to the elderly. The hardest part of the job is keeping the customers satisfied during the holidays. The most enjoyable part is meeting so many new faces each day."
good,"We would have our daily kick off meeting to tell us what the case count was and what the expected time out would be. We would then find a ride get our headsets & go to work. The headsets were what would tell us our orders to pull. I learned how to pull from a 80% to a 110% and make more money by pulling more of a percentage. The management were a great bunch of people, they were always there to help  if help was needed. My co-workers pretty much kept to them selves, we all knew we had a job to do so we would just do it. The hardest part of the job was learning how to select from 80% to higher. It took me a couple of months but once I learned to do it steady & evenly it was no problem to select up to 110% and make more money while doing so. The most enjoyable part of the job was the money. I would be a liar if I didn't mention that as part of the good thing. The other good thing was that after so many days of no one getting hurt on the job they would have a dinner for us, steak & shrimp or steak and lobster, it would just depend on who wanted what. I also liked the hours I worked, I would rather work nights than day anytime. but I am able to work anytime I am needed."
good,"Good company to work for the only down fall were the front line managers who liked the power and showed little interest in their associates well being, however that is in most companies that have many stores and managers are allowed to do as they please as long as the bottom line is met. "

good,"Publix is a great company to work for. I worked in multiple departments, but my home is the deli where I would open the department, assist the manager with merchandising, sales for the floor and new focus items. I also managed my associates and trained new ones. The management was very good and fair and always focused on working as a team. My co-workers were hard working and helped out. The hardest part of the job was when the budget cuts down hours and going from 4 to 3 to 2 closers a night adding more stress on the cleaning, but you learn once again it's all about time management and team work from the day crew for when the when the night crew come in. The most enjoyable part was making everyone happy and at ease in a busy department with delivering premier customer service."

good,On a typical day you would consistently be retrieving carts and bagging for costumers. I've learned how to mange time properly with the knowledge of what's appropriate and what isn't appropriate according to the situation. The Management is great at accommodating your needs with your work schedule. The work culture is amazing you'll meet amazing people with the same goals as you which builds a bond with your team. The hardest Part of the job is some of the rare costumers that are rude and disrespectful but that rarely ever happens. The most enjoyable part of the job is feeling like you accomplished something.

good,This place is an excellent place to work! Management was great to work with and there were great opportunities for advancement within the work place. Compensation was fair and there were plenty of work hours given and plenty of overtime when needed. I would definitely recommend this place for a possible employment opportunity for someone else.

good,My overall experience as an Publix employee is pleasent and I developed several personal and professional relationships with my associates. I thoroughly enjoyed working and solving everyday problems with my managers. I developed relationships with my “regulars” and some even made a point to sought after me when they had questions or concerns.
good,Everyone at Publix was very friendly. You could get along with everyone you worked with. The store is always clean and is kept up by the staff themselves everyday. The only down side to publix was getting paid so little.
good,"Working at publix demand a lot of patient specially for individual who want to have a career in the company. It's not easy to get a full-time position at publix. However, once hired u job is pretty much guaranteed until you quit or do something stupid to get fired."

good,"Very Friendly people from the co-workers to the Customers."

good,"Working at Publix was an experience like no other. Everyday when you walked through the doors, you were automatically greeted with nothing but love. As a young person myself, I would definitely say that this would be a great job for a teenager. They give so many chances to advance in the company and interact in so many fundraisers. Publix truly gave me a great working experience and if it hadn't been for my relocation then I would very much so still be working with them. This company is awesome."

good,"Working for this company, more specifically in the front service department, will get you out of your comfort zone if you are not used to talking to people. I went in as someone who is shy and would panic at any pressure and came out with great problem-solving and communication skills. Managers will always be there to hear any complaints or ideas you have."

They provide a safe, and clean working environment, and take notice when an associate is providing excellent customer service. When a customer compliments an associate's service to a manager, they will often reward that associate with a customer compliment card for a free sub or other specified item, which is really cool! They show excellent leadership, an strive to take their team to the next level in providing premier customer service, and strive to be the premier quality food retailer in the world!"

good,"Publix treats their associates very well. They could give more hours to most of their associates and less to others but, they give good starting pay and you do get a 25 cent raise each six months after your evaluation of the past six months. Over all, yes I would recommend Publix to people who are looking for a good paying job."
good,A typical day at Publix is fast paced. But the management is supportive and understanding. Hours are very flexible and shifts can be switched with other employees if something comes up.
good,Publix has been a wonderful job to have while completing my degree with their flexible hours and accommodating schedule. A Very supportive staff has worked with other employees and myself to find what best benefits the store and our personal lives.
good,"It's a good place to work overall, good benefits, friendly staff, clean environment. The only problem is that some levels of management feels it is necessary to watch your every move."
good,Once you clock in I would say good morning to everyone than check on what my freezer looks like. If I have a truck I would work on it the main goal is to finish truck before you leave. If I don't have a truck then just work back stock.
good,Publix is one of the best companies. I really enjoyed my time working there and would refer anyone to work there. The company really cares about their employees and customers.
good,Great company to work for. Excellent benefits and Publix always cares about their employees. Great career opportunities and options to advance. Publix strives to provide great customer service

good,"If the grocery business is your career path, you could not be with a better company.  Very accommodating to life outside of work.  Many opportunities for advancement."
good,"Work at Publix is a challenge, hard to make your bosses happy. We focus 100 percent in customer service, great company but the founder concept change because of completion grow in comparision with 15 or 20 years ago. Too much stress don't work the effort. Great benefits, productivity concept impossible to fulfill, especially for stores that sell below 500,000 a week.Stable job talking in a long term path career, Lots of possibility to build a solid management career."
good,Great benefits great cultural just not the place for me . If your interested in retail this is a great place . They truly care about their employees. I scored role model on evaluations and got 50 cent to dollar raises every six months.  I invested 6 years and left not hating the place
good,"It was a nice experience working for them, I learned a few new things and I liked to work there thanks to the environment that I worked in, but most of my coworkers were uninspired and that just made my work harder and I took the opportunity when we moved from the city and quitted."
good,"Publix is widely known for having exceptional customer service by always being able to go above and beyond a customer's expectations. The goal is to leave customers with such an amazing experience that they continue to come back. Publix manages to come up with new ideas that keep the company up to date. The company also has great benefits that include dental, health and vision insurance. They also give you the opportunity to go to college on their dime as long as you study something that is convenient to the company."
good,Publix is a great place to work. The company is very organized and well put together. The manager and co-workers are friendly and well to get along with. You can learn a lot about publix and how the business is run. The products are fresh and great. You also can meet new and exciting people at publix. My working experience their was great. I will come back and work for Publix again.
good,only issue was that I was not getting a lot of hours but I loved it there management was awesome I had understanding people but  less than 20 hours but I would work there again as part time
good,"Several of my co-workers applied for full-time and months afterwards, they still heard nothing. Management was rude when they asked about it, so changing positions/jobs is very difficult."
good,"I worked at Publix for about 6 months. The pay was good, and the scheduling was very flexible. However, I recommend applying for a job other than bagger."
good,"I worked for this company for a short time period. For college students is a good place to start, the schedule is flexible. The overall  environment is friendly and you make friends."
good,Publix is a good family oriented company. They offer competing benefits and offer many opportunities for advancement into management. I would recommend this company.
good,"I love people and working with them. When I have fantastic co-workers, the job gets even better. I only worked here over a summer to help pay bills and help my mother out but it was definitely an enjoyable experience. It seemed like each day I was learning new things as I was advancing around positions and excelling at the job. The biggest aspect that I learned and can take away from this job is the customer interactions. I believe as young adult/teen, working in fast food or a grocery store is very beneficial to your future career. This is because you learn an extreme amount about customers and interactions with them. Through experience, you encounter great customers but like all jobs, there are the angry ones. Here is where you are able to learn in thrive as you are able to handle complaints and settle disputes. This would definitely be the hardest part about the job and trying to satisfy the angry customers. It is also enjoyable resolving a conflict and turning a once angry customer to a satisfied one."
good,customer service is everything the management is very friendly but they don't joke around about there customer service policy's co-workers are very nice but you will be running around all day so I do not suggest this job if you have any sort of injury best part of the job though is the staff
good,"Tasks are laid out daily by truck schedule, learned about inventory management and merchandising, management is decent, coworkers are friendly, hardest part is having to pull weight of weak links, most enjoyable part is hour long lunch breaks"
good,"I loved working at Publix. I met so many wonderful people during my almost 4 years spent there. My typical day at work was normally really good! Although, there would be really rough days, but that's with any job really. I learned so much about relating with people and giving people wonderful experiences in the customer service realm! Management was always so helpful and knowledgeable, but some managers weren't very good, to be honest. I'm not calling anybody out because they don't deserve that! Oh my gosh, I couldn't say any nicer things about my co-workers, they were always so nice and always had stuff to talk about which kept me interested all the time! As a cashier/bagger there really isn't that hard of a part in your job, aside from money management because you would have mishaps with tills and whatnot, which would easily be fixed. My most enjoyable part of the job would be the great benefits that you would receive there and the recognition if you exceed someone's expectations!"
good,Publix es una empresa donde creci como persona tanto en lo profesional como en lo personal
good,If you need reliable job PUBLIX is it benefits holiday pay major holidays days off manager work with you open door policy and every six months pay rise

The work environment is good, with everybody being friendly to one-another. job security is great and Job advancement is pretty constant, but be sure to be patient if you want a full-time job there. Some people have been waiting there for years upon years to be offered a full-time position."
good,"I would Make the breads, rolls,i would put away the trucks enter what i made into the computer. I learned how to make different breads. Got along great with my co workers and management. Hardest part of the job was time management."
good,"Bagger, get carts from outside, help customers find and grab items, help customers to their car and put bags in their car, make sure store is clean, inform customers about items they ask about, find prices of items, clean and stock restrooms/break rooms, clean managers office, clean front entrance, stock carts, clean registers, stock bags and registers, stock paper towels and soap in restrooms, use floor cleaning machine to go around the whole store and clean floors, maintain and clean floor machines."
good,"Publix is a an equal opportunity I very much enjoyed my time there, I cannot think of a single co-worker nor a manager that I ever had any issue with, they were all a pleasure to work with and gave me plenty of opportunity to move upwards in the company."
good,I truly enjoyed my working experience at Publix. The staff including management were like family. It was a rewarding experience.
good,"Usual day Consists of Stocking Merchandise on Shelves, Bagging customer items, and bringing in karts."
good,you are expected to work holidays and weekends.benefits are good hourly pay not that good.alot has changed over the 35 years I worked there.
good,"What I enjoy the most about my job is interacting with customers, and helping them. I learned to multi-task, be patient,and understanding."
good,"Part of my training was done on a computer, while the other half was done on the job. Management would allow you to make your own schedule. I always thought of my co-workers as one dynamic team."
good,Worked for them for 2 years now and it's great. Cashiering is nice because you get to meet new people but bagging sucks during the summer.
good,Publix  is a retail  store that  is proud of their  excellent customer service.  I learned how to interact with customers in the friendly manner.  Management has a professional way of treating their employees.  The co-workers are pleasant.  But they give very few work hours schedule that pays income that  is not enough to support  your basic needs.
good,the pay and the benefits for this company are great. But better make sure your wife is ok with crazy schedule and she can do most of everything to raise any kids you may have
good,"As a student I used to work a part time job it was a good job for a high school student making some extra cash while going to school I did enjoy the and the job and the co-workers, and the management team they were a good people to work with."
good,dealing with different type of people everyday is some what challenging for me and it was a good too. learning different types of job in the field

Many of the clients becomes regular mainly because of the high customer service experience by excellent employees who does not feel any pressure from our reasonable managers who understand that the customer needs more than just a transaction. . In the work environment we find a flexibility when it comes to our customer ,we want them to be happy with the business we are making, so we do everything possible making then to feel like our company is the best place to go. The hardest part of the job and like any other business is when several people does not show off to work and their work is spread out with the employee that remains, and the main reason is that we have a high volume of customers more than any company similar than i have known. I consider that the most enjoyable part of the job is when I meet out customers and I get to see how they really are, when they laugh, tells story, when they got issues and I have to find the best solutions. I think the best part is when you feel free to take decisions that  benefits the company and  the  clients."

As you may see from my day to day job tasks I have learned a lot from Publix, from bagging groceries, cashier, administrative work the list goes on.

Working for Publix I think you automaticlly become family to the people you work with because you see them so much. I think me and my co- workers a very close.

good,Working at Publix was GREAT!!! All of my co-workers were like family. Everyone got along with just about everyone. The customers were definitely the most enjoyable part. The only hard part was keeping up with the rest of the team.

good,"I dealt with quite the variety of people on a daily basis. The typical day involved checking customers out, bagging their groceries, keeping my immediate area clean, and maintaining a neat and professional appearance. I learned how to deal with all kinds of people and made sure that every customer was satisfied upon departure. The store manager, assistant store manager, and customer service manager were all great with being fair to every employee. There were a few people up front in customer service that showed quite a bit of favoritism towards other cashiers and baggers. With some people, if they didn't like you, then they didn't treat you with respect like they should. I managed to get along well with most of my co-workers. Those that I didn't, I simply put on a happy face to avoid anything that could start a problem. The hardest part of the job would have to be the repetitiveness. Doing the same thing over and over and over again in this case wasn't exactly thrilling. The best part of my job would have to be meeting so many different people on a daily basis. I had the craziest conversations that someone just couldn't make up."

good,"A typical day at work for a front service clerk is starting out bagging groceries for customers. Once the groceries are bagged and loaded into the cart, we are required to offer the customer carry-out service. That is, pushing the cart out and loading up the car for the customer. Other parts of this job include, gathering carts from the lot, picking up baskets from under the register, helping customers finding products, putting products back on the shelf that the customer didn't want and anything else the management asks you to do. I learned a lot about people skills. For a few years I went on mission trips and learned people skills, however, the people skills learned on this job are incredilbe. You interact with all types of people. Learning how to interact to satisfy their needs can be challenging and this is something I did well with. Management is pretty good at Publix. You can always go to them with any of your problems and they will help you the best they can. My co-workers are amazing. They were so welcoming when I started and I get along with them all. The hardest part of the the job is getting the carts from the lot. With the hot and humid weather in Florida, getting carts can be a painful and exhausting job. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers."

My department manager allowed me to start to train in decorating, which was something I reallly wanted to do. While having amazing department managers, you still had to deal with store managers. Some store managers aren't as great as others and wouldn't make you feel good about your work ethic/progress at Publix. Some managers like to say one thing and do another. My store manager did not allow any employee get another over a 4 on your evaluation. I did not feel like I was able to move up the company ladder at my location so I did resign."

The culture is a group of highly motivated individuals with a positive attitude. Publix does a fantastic job of hiring employees who can meet their standard of excellence.

good,I loved working for publix but there is a major issue with scheduling. I would love my current position if I had a set schedule that would allow me to plan events and have a well rounded  balanced life.
good,"My time at publix was short lived due to pitiful management, the manager played favorites heavily with all the employees under her and if you upset her or just out right dident agree with her that would spell your doom, my hours went from an average of 20 hours a week as a part timer to just about 4 hours a week tops. there is no way anyone can live on that and being as young as i was with no car it dident help that this was my only job, i dont know if its this way at other publix stores but the one i worked at was horrifying and i dont think i would recommend that store to anyone i know."
good,"the most enjoyable part about working at publix is the interactions with the customers, the only I have with the publix I work at is the management is very childish"
good,"Learned a lot of everything wic checks, codes for produce,  commuting, with customers welcome guests as they enter door or checkout stand  thanked them when order was finished and took out groceries when possible invited guests to come again and have a wonderful and blessed day. Worked great with co-workers."
good,It is a great first job for kid in high school and collage. Fast moving. Where I work we have fun but get the job done. They hold a high stander for there workers.
good,they pay really well and that’s about it and if you like stepping on people to advance your careeer then this is the job for you and they also sleep with each in the whole company
good,"You do the work of 2 or more people, when I was working for my job title I wasn't able to learn much as the older decorators stuck me with beginner work as opposed to letting me learn new things."
good,You can not survive off what they pay unless your in management they do not offer bonuses & more there so caled culture is gone too corporate now it Very sad to see
good,Bag groricies collect carts and assist customers. low pay but it is a teenager job. Get to see different people(fine withe women)
good,"Customer service staff, Cashier, and Stock Clerk"
good,"hard to advance, the company is so unorganized  and hard to approach managers. They overwork you and don't care about if you have other things to do."
good,"working at publix when first started was a great job, when two managers were transferred out the new managers were not accustomed to the way we as employees did our job and it became less of a good environment to work in"
good,Publix is a good job if your starting off working young and want to make a little money but its not something you can live off and support a family.  They aren't keen on bringing you up to bigger positions all the time and depending on the Publix you work at the management is either great or horrible.
good,Great company paid is horrible. they take advantage of you. Publix offers a great learning experience when it comes to proper work etiquette. But its not all who takes advantage of what this company offers.
good,I did not care for this company but It was a job and provided for my family. I tried to advance for 6 years and never got the opportunity to even after working so hard
good,"Too long of a time before advancing is possible, while at the same time the people that are there a long time have irrevocable privileges that are unfair."
good,"I enjoy meeting new people every day and responding to questions, and provide customers with information needed to make product-related decisions.  Refill and rotate produce.  I've learned more about produce products - different ones that I've never used before."
good,"Greeted customers on the front and back end taking and recording payments on the back end"
good,"Typical day at work was having to helping customers either at the register or in the bakery. What I learned is the ways you can tell a fake bill or check. I have also learned to always keep your area clean and organized. The management is not very good sometimes I'm responsible for managers work when I am not allowed to be or they don't care when I need help with a customer or when I need to do what another manager tells me to do. My co-workers some are very hard workers, they help each other, and they know how to keep a work area clean. The others are rude and they are unorganized and don't keep the area clean. The hardest part is trying to help costumers while trying to get my other responsibility's done before the time my managers give me. When I help a costumer and they have a smile on their face."
good,Loved the job and almost all the people. Just not my market mgr who would not give me bit four hours every day. I worked with a great bunch of people.
good,Good company to work for nice benefits but has poor management and terrible shift hours there’s no type of work life balance.plus there is no confidentiality between mangers and associates
good,"Good place to work, management varies from to store to store. Very good at working around school schedules (I am a college student). Very easy to transfer stores if you are wanting too."
good,"There is absolutely no work life balance. They expect you to dedicate your life to the place. They want all of your time, but get upset when you get overtime. They expect you to do too much in the time you are there. Everyone is quitting so they expect you to do their job as well. They put anyone into management because no one wants to be in management anymore. Management is awful. They talk poorly about the employees, they are mean to them, do things out of spite, disrespect them. Half of the time they aren't even nice to the customers. This company is going downhill fast."
good,Publix was a job where you had to work extremely hard and was very fast paced. I worked in the back office as apart of customer service staff which included alot of responsibilities in balancing money and other things that required you to be extremely focus because you're dealing with alot of counting money which has to be accurate
good,"Publix is a equal employment personnel that says they personally advance the company from within, this is true but they dont tsll you it can take up to 5 plus years to do so."
good,"A typical day at work was working at an assigned cash register. I greeted a customers coming through the line to get the merchandise checked out. Often times this led to conversation about anything of immediate interest (elections, gas prices, food prices, etc.). The most enjoyable aspect of this job was large population of foreign visitors at this Publix location (Longboat Key, Fl). At one point I had to use my French knowledge to make the sale. Also, the sale process is very busy involving computer look-ups for non-marked merchandise, packing in an organized fashion, having to be very vigilant to get all items accounted for before the final price is figured. "
good,"Management was horrid at times, favoritism was shown drastically. Nothing was ever set in stone, always picked on for being a newbie. Called out for throwing up and my hours were cut to 5 hours a week and then 10 hours the next... It's not worth the money. Newbies get stuck on a 3 hour long cleaning duty that consists of cleaning, mopping, trash duty, sweeping, cleaning toilets, sink, mirrors, rugs, changing out toilet paper and paper towels."
good,"work was rarely stressful, my hours were never guaranteed and i would get around 8 hours a week. management tended to not take stuff as seriously as they should, there is a time for fun and a time to work."
good,Its a great company and makes you feel like family from the start. I just think they need to focus on people as individuals instead or a crew that works for them.
good,where working and shopping is a pleasure. Publix is a company where you can grow and advance over extended period of time and they don't promote based on credentials.
good,"Publix is a great place to work, if you are a full timer the benefits and holiday pay is great as well. A typical day a work is slicing deli meat and subs"
good,"As said in the summary, I loved the people there but some of the staff were very ""abusive"" of their powers. The store manager I had was very nice, along with the assistant store manager, but some of the ""customer service staff"" did not deserve to have the power they held. "
good,"It is a good first job to get your foot into the work place, the benefits are not what they used to be but the customers are friendly and will work with you."
good,Overall Publix has been a great company.  Employees can work their way up to management.
good,To establish a long-term career and apply my knowledge and skill as a warehouse associate.
good,"Work as deli clerk"
good,"Growing up in the PORT ORANGE, FL area most of my life working at this Publix gave me the opportunity to see people I have not see very often , met new people, and learn how the deli works & .I enjoyed the fast pace environment and the satisfaction of supplying food for someone's happy tummy."
good,"Publix is very thorough in every aspect of the word when it comes to both shopping and employment. However, they're very expensive and sometimes, uncomfortably selective of their employees."
good,Working for this company is good if you are looking to make extra cash or if you want a career with good benefits. But the stress coming from the managers isn't worth it and the customer treats you badly and management doesn't do anything about it.
good,I started with this company in 2007-2014 great company very solid in supporting their employees in any way possible. Management could use more trainer to better lead their employees
good,"publix is a great place to work, but as the company grows bigger they are losing sight of essential parts of what made this company flourish and stand apart for years."
good,Kept cutting hours back.They keep hiring people and cut back our hours.I was down too working one or two days a week.Four hrs.That is not enough to pay my bills.
good,Publix is a great place to work. There are some people that are given authority and they abuse that power and make it uncomfortable for others who just want to work for the company and not for the person of authority per se. I strongly believe that you can be successful at Publix if you are surrounded by the right people.
good,"I learned a lot while working at Publix, it is a great work environment. There was never a hard day of work although it can get really busy and I'm use to being in busy work environments. I absolutely LOVE being in busy work environments because it keeps me and other workers going and time goes by faster!"
good,"Nice place to work and meet different people"
good,Overall I loved my job but it was a very fast paced work environment there were a lot of days where it was almost too much to bear but I hung in there for 7 years because of my regular customers.
good,I can say that you shouldn't expect much fun working at a grocery store but Publix was just no fun. I worked short hours and never enjoyed going into work.
good,To me its a great company but they are some what unstructured and most of the time I noticed stress but finally I am a hard worker but really feel under paid and I do the most and have a family plus no sick days or vacations days either don't get paid when I take my vacation or get penalized for calling out
good,most enjoyable  meeting new customers. not all employees got along. management was ok to talk to. hardest was to go in & out from hot to cold weather.
good,The management is generally unfit to manage even a sub department in a grocery store. Astonishing lack of advancement even from the lowest positions in the store.
good,"One of the place ever that was my first job I USA I was going to school after I have to go to work at Publix that was cool everyone love"
good,I worked in the deli at publix and it is extremely difficult to work there. Most days I never got a lunch because we would get too busy and no one would go to the kitchen so I could take break. The customers always get upset with us about things but more or less it's the managers position not ours. Working in the deli is like working at McDonald's . Extremely hard work and no pay or benefits....
good,Very customer centered. Willing to work with you when it comes to hours and forms of advancement and department transfers. Be aware that there is some benefits but it takes up to a year for some of them.
good,"A typical day at work at Publix is very productive. Some co-workers are lazy and don't want to work, which makes you work harder, then there are some that go above and beyond to display premier customer service. I would say the hardest part of the job is dealing with frustrated customers."
good,"bagged breads and other products , helped out customers . Stocked innovatory and unloaded new shipment . I also decorated cakes and cupcakes"
good,"Overall I like working here. I enjoy the team of individuals that i get to work with, everyone gets along well and we work together to get the job done."
good,"I love Publix, but not my store. A typical day is physically demanding but very enjoyable with all of the customer interactions."
good,I work in the liquor store and business is sparse. There is not a steady flow of customers and the job is boring.We receive freight 2 times a week and work it as it comes in. I run a register and give customer service by taking customers to the product. Clean and dust shelves and merchandise and sweep and mop the floors at night as well as clean the bathrooms.
good,I am very organized so I love making sure everything was always in order
good,"Getting to meet and know customers from all walks of life and all ages."
good,not much to say - a lot of work. interaction with plants.  plants call in the evening for assistance - culture tries to incorporate some fun items to keep it fresh. lunch is free. good times for anyone that likes this kind of culture.
good,"Empresa agradável de trabalhar, porém salário baixo, carga horária grande e cansativa e tive que para os estudos."
good,I do my checklist make sure i have everything for my shift. Then i position my people where i know they are their best. Then I alk thru my grill check my meat chicken and fish nuggets and make sure we have enough to last us for the shift. Talk with the other manager to see how the previous shift was and if they were busy or not. I learned how to input data into the computer and also clean all the machines in the store. The hardest part is dealing with the crew memebers and other managers because of the different personalities. You have to make sure not to offend anyone because your crew is who delivers the customer service and the food.
good,"My day at Publix is up and down sometimes fast and then sometimes slow. I have learned alot by the 4years i have been with the company hot to deal with customers,handle money, move on a fast paste, self control and more.management is great at times, Co-workers was great work together. My hardest was dealing with customers that wasn't happy with the service. most joyfull part working hard to make my customers happy.."
good,"great place to work ,,, they care about the worker , also great customer services... nice and clean place to shop with your family.."
good,It was a good job to get me to the next step in life. Managers push you very hard and fast to be promoted but as soon as you make 1 small mistake you are highly reprimanded or terminated. Lacks on the job training.
good,"Great place to work, if you stay with this company you can get promoted very quickly. Friendly environment,  Customer Service is always #1. Working with customers to make them happy is a goal all stores should have."
good,This company takes a while to get promoted. I love publix and want to stay with the company. I just need s full time job. They seem to be dragging their feet.
good,Great company i enjoyed working with them and learning from them. I liked meeting new people and figuring out how i could help them. Publix likes to tell you no talking while working.
good,How ever they have certain things and times they want you to do things By there way Otherwise bad review for yourself means no pay raise = no advancement.
good,Coprate know nothing about the in store day to day business. They try to run a company from behind a desk looking at reports. Never in the stores. Never seen by associate.
good,It's enjoyable just doesn't pay the bills don't intend to leave till I have another job. I really am just interested in trying new things and trying to find a job more entertaining.
good,"Publix is, in my opinion, a superior place to grocery shop as it is clean, the food is top quality and most of all, the people who work there are extremely helpful."
good,"a typical day at work-Go to work,Clock In,smile,be friendly to the customers,do what your boss and others expect from you,Clock Out and Go Home at the end of the day."
good,"Some workers put more efforts and hard work than others, and other workers just working so slow till the end of their shift. I guess a great management would make a big difference."
good,Good entry level job if you want and have the chance to dedicate the time to as promotions seem to be based off a seniority system which allows them to make sure  they keep the higher ups
good,"Publix offers a great environment for entry and non educated employees. It's a great place to work at if you are young, not saying the age discriminate, however, advancement for elderly is not likely, but that was my experience. Publix is a safe place to work and the best for entry level for young people. My son worked for Publix for several years before he moved on.I left for two reasons, lack of advancement, and I did reach the age of retirement."
good,"The hours constantly change if you don't stop the managers, the benefits are very good, you'll keep your job if your working but good luck getting full time. Management rarely works with you and expects 500% "
good,"Busy, productive. Work the back off where I learned to count/organize/put away/take out money. Learned to sell lottery, western union, and money orders. Hardest part was getting out of work so late."
good,"Customers made the day"
good,"It is good if you don't have small children or family . They have good benefits if you are full time..They promote within,but sometimes promote people not worthy of positions."
good,"Didn't really like working at the publix that i did. Did make any friends, everyone i worked with just came off at snobby and kind of rude. Management was alright. Hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers."
good,The work life was sometimes very tedious and management did not consider my school schedule and I was semi forced to choose between work and school. I did learn the meaning of discipline and hard work as I moved tons of water around daily. I also learned to better interact with customers and provide excellent customer service.
good,When working for Publix you are always on the move. People that work with you are enjoyable and they can help you get much done in the work place. Fun
good,"A typical day at work would consist of bagging, getting shopping carts, working in produce, deli, bakery,  some custodian work ie. waxing floors, stripping floors, and stocking. I learned a lot of decent customer service skills that helped me in my other positions. The management here wasn't the best, they all just kind of stayed to themselves. They only talked to the employees if they had an issue. The coworkers were decent there was a lot of drama in the workplace."
good,"I enjoyed doing my internship at this office. The place was lean back but work also had to be done. A lot of clients so I found myself busy at all times. The co-workers were all helpful and nice. The attorney was awesome, she is successful at what she does and also great as a person."
good,"Enjoyed with the people that I have meet. Bu management could have been better. They don't help you in anyway, also the open door policy what a joke."
good,"A great place to work while in college, but management has their favorites throughout the company. I would've made a career there, but it didn't feel like the right choice for me."
good,"Publix is a great company to work for. However, there are very few fulltime positions. If there were more openings available to become fulltime I would still be there."
good,This company will teach you the ins and outs of retail and customer service. So learn it and use it to further your self when it comes to dealing with people.
good,"Good company overall."
good,Publix is great but it is time for me to move forward and enter my field.
good,"To start off, I'm not going to lie, I love working for Publix, but the thing is, is that if you want to move up in the business, you will have to know somebody real well. Now speaking on the benefits, you can get benefits, only if you have enough hours to qualify. For some reason I was denied my full time and I applied for full time MULTIPLE times and her I am still part time. The management is good at my store. I personally don't think the managing is not the best and could be better. One of the mangers just walks around, does not help out in any departments, and eats samples from each department. That manager pretty much does whatever and plays way too much!!"
good,"I enjoy working at Publix, I love my customers. I feel like they all are different extended parts of my family. I love the atmosphere during the holiday times, when relatives come from out of town to be with family. I take care of different payment options such as cash, check, debt/credit. I handle complaints, questions, and concerns. I assist any customer that needs help. Greet each shopper while entering and exiting the store. Make the visit to our location very easy, as well as enjoyable."
good,"I enjoyed checking in and out the truck drivers and joking with them; and loved all my coworkers that liked my company as well. The security department does not give breaks, even during a 12 hour shift! Most of the time there is also no offer of a lunch break. This made for long hard days. My Supervisor had a personal agenda against me (the HR guy told me so but cared not to help me) so I spent over 2 years being harrassed until they came up with a lie and fired me. I am a fighter so I am trying to get that job back but if I do not, I will still give 100% to my next employer."
good,"Love my job now but need to get paid more.i need weekend off due to my son...I'm a single mom that loves to work but also need to be with my son..I love this job cause I'm all about customer service, and that is what this job is about!"
good,Worked with all types of individuals and races. Met new people and a prominent opportunity in creating relationships while working hard to keep areas clean and customers satisfied.
good,"This is a fun place to work, I can interact with different people on a daily basis.The managers are very friendly, the staff my co-workers are great too."
good,"In my experience at Publix, I learned a lot about the importance of customer service and giving back to the community. As a stock clerk, I learned how to communicate to customers and fulfill the needs of those who came to get help. The managers were also very understanding when it came to me going to school and gave me flexible hours."
good,A typical day was fun. I learned alot of things that will help me in the future. The management was great. The workplace culture was good. The hardest part well there was none. Everything was enjoyable.
good,The hours were good. The store manager helped me so much but that’s because he saw how hardworking I was. Overall it was a good experience working there.
good,My most enjoyable part of the working at Publix was serving the customers. I love meeting and talking to people. I love getting to know them and what they're shopping for.
good,Loved this job they offer full or partime as long as you work. You work with nice and friendly people and customers are never so mean that you would want to quit this job.
good,I enjoyed working at Public for the past 15 years. I learned a lot and had the opportunity to work with great people. I was given the chance to make a career at Publix that afforded me the ability to support myself and my family.
good,Great company to work for many different things that they offer for long staying employees. Very family oriented and everyone is so willing to help you.
good,U get a review and a chance to get a raise every six months  they donate to a lot of charities and they work with all schedules that way u can be flexible with school college appointments and other things that go on in your everyday lifestyle
good,"Overall a great place to work. We all help each other. Management ensures we all receive time off for family, community groups, school, etc. Hours can be a bit long."
good,"Overall a great company in terms of flexibility, productivity and advancement within the company.                                                    ."
good,"Time clock policy is inflexible and strictly enforced, regardless of employees circumstances or hardships. Cause for termination is policy driven due to management pressure from corporate."
good,"Working at Publix taught me a lot of essential skills that helped me build a good work ethic for example that it is important to be punctual when coming and leaving work, and to keep a clean work place, as well as to work as a team to please and help the customer."
good,Great experience with hadling customer service and employees. Worked with the company for 10+ year and helped me grow and learned a lot with communicating and handling problems.
good,Publix was a great company to work for . They have very flexible hour. The management is great to be around. They also have a lot of benefits for employers
good,"Bad experience with terrible Supervisors with disrespectful manner, not giving their breaks on time, lunches even it was difficult to get removed from the cashier register just to go to the restroom."
good,A typical day for me was Check schedules for inbound outbound trucks overlook third-party handling company.Print labels according to the DO.Cycle count and label every pallet find every special order
good,"Publix is a great company yo work with but my position is soo physical and crazy."
good,"I have some awesome coworkers I have known since Day 1. Employees take care of each other and keep each other motivated, or listen to each other when  one has a problem."
good,"This company by far is one of the best to work for, raises every 6 months, outstanding management, never have to worry about being out of a job, the company its self is just really easy to get to know"
good,Its a pretty decent place to work with pretty good benefits for full time employees. The problem is I have seen people get hire for for full tome while more deserving part time employees get passed up and thats against their own bylines.
good,5-6am start the day ...making sure sales floor is set filled and organized.... orders are done ..having enough assistance .. customer service cooking.. doing platters.. preparing for the day
good,You'll have a promising future working at Publix. The company puts their employees first. Giving you great benefits and financial security for the future.
good,Pulling trucks and stocking shelves. Walking customers to the product. Making sure product is facing forward and stocked. Changing displays and making sure sales are presented well in the store.
good,Great business model. they promote from within and make sure you know the inner workings of the company before advancing you. it is also an employee owned company
good,I bagged groceries and cashiered at Store #0621 in South Beach. This is where I really developed my customer service skills and my proficiency in cashiering.
good,"Friendly atmosphere to both customers and employees! Job was stocking overnight, had good people I worked with and the pay was decent for the work done. I would recommend them to others."
good,"Along with all the benefits, the pay is great for a grocery store.  Everyone works together to make our customers happy. Very flexible with hours and will try to match pay from previous job."
good,Great products and great staff. Very approachable management with happy people that mostly love their job. Many opportunities for advancement as well.
good,"Experienced trustworthy and dependable person, in seek of a position with advancement opportunities 	where i can utilized my energy, spunk, creativeness and multi-tasking abilities in order to achieve for my goal. Authorized to work in the US for any employer."
good,"Great company to work for, the benefits are outstanding, not the same as it used to be though, best part of the job is the free stock and dividend checks"
good,"Although the pay was on the lower side for being a pharmacy tech, the experience and management was outstanding. I learned a great deal about pharmaceuticals during my time working for Publix pharmacy."
good,Very very very amazing staff and everyone is so welcoming and easy going this place is so amazing to work for they love their customers as family its a great place
good,I really do not wish to review my current work position online. It is required for me to write one hundred and fifty characters in order to apply for a job on this site.
good,I enjoyes telling you guys about me. And hopefully we can start to work somthing out. I love dogs and believe this is the best thing.Also a team worker and very flexible
good,Publix was a great place to work. They do require you be on time and have a strict dress code. They do not hire full-time workers but make it easy to become full time once you put in the work.
good,"Call dr offices, call patients, call insurance companies, fill prescriptions, add insurance to patients profile, cashier, scan prescriptions in, data entry, fax, verify inbound, sync prescriptions,"
good,Publix is an amazing job with infinite room form advancement. If you wanted to make a career out of this place then you absolutely could do it if you had the drive and work ethic.
good,"very fast paced, but very fun. management was very easy to get along with, and they were willing to work with you regarding any situation. I learned so much working with this company. the customers were very pleasant and always left positive comments regarding the workers."
good,"What an amazing company to work for, from 401K to being able to buy in to the stockholder share program. Publix is always pushing you to become a better person personally and in the community. The managers believe in helping  you achieve your goals and keep you motivated."
good,"Just a great working atmosphere would recommend to anyone, Started off as a stoplight ended as a cashier great benefits and the people I work with ensure that I did everything correctly in a timely manner. Thankful for the time I worked in this position and help me develop a lot of life skills would recommend to anyone"
good,Publix is a great place to work and we always deal with customers everyday. We all great along at work and have a great time there. The most enjoyable part of the job is that we get to amazing people everyday.
good,"Publix is a good company to work for.. I was a rehire with them.. they take care of their employees and offer good benefits, everyone is friendly and helpful"
good,"At Publix you will learn a lot from the people you’ll work with. Your employees are basically your best friend when it come down to work, they the only people who can help you with something you need help with."
good,Learning to work as a team to bring premier customer service was among the most valuable experience that I learned at Publix. Very productive work environment with friendly staff.
good,"Most of the people are great, the work is not too extensive, and the atmosphere is very comfortable. The hours aren't always great but if you're flexible then it will work for you."
good,The people are great. Everyone is helpful and friendly. People come up to you and introduce themselves. It’s a refreshing place. I would definitely recommend it to those seeking a different kind of retail experience.
good,Where Shopping Is A Pleasure!  No  matter what Or where your Working @ Publix that is the Goal for Both The Management Team & Associates Team & That the Customer Always Is & Comes First.
good,"My boss was great but there were days we worked 12 hr shift and I only made 9.50 an hour. Also because I was in pharmacy there was absolutley no room for advancement. the pharmacy is a seperate entity from publix grocery store so when I tried to work in the store and the pharmacy to boost my income the wouldnt let me. so I had to quit, which sucked but they left me no choice. Also Publix offers NO EMPLOYEE DISCOUNTS at all. so eveything you buy no matter how long you work there is always gunna be full price. The running joke amongst employees at publix is how they get paid then get in there cars and drive to walmart just to buy groceries because Publix is so over priced. No one is willing to blow their paycheck there. Anyways the pharmacy was fun, but the store was not."
good,I loved my job i found my strong point i have great customer service .i liked helping and assisting customers with there needs and i liked the opportunities this company gives you
good,Publix is a great job and a very good experience for someone who has just started working and who likes to work I have learned a lot from working at Publix
good,I worked there at two stores plus the warehouse had a great time. Weekly checks  if you are at a store bonus every 3 months worked at both Plantation stores
good,"Publix was a good company to work for, the pay was great, the hours are good, you benefit more from being a full time associate through, part time has its benefits too, if you’re stuck in life and don’t know what to do about your future, Publix can basically get your started for a career in Publix, never met someone that hated there in all honesty lol"
good,"Enjoyed everything I learned working with Publix.I learned the best customer service skills,that I still use with other job opportunities that I come across."
good,"Very busy for the entire shift. The management team are always available for any kind of situations. People are very friendly, the environment make you feel like you are home. Very fast paced."
good,"A typical day at work consists of dealing with customers, handling money, and selling products. While working at Publix I learned tons and tons of management tools.

Everyday was different for example new sub of the day new sales new party trays/platters new customers it was always a challenge but I enjoyed learning new things and keeping busy."

Each day I enjoyed going to work because I knew that while either ringing a customer's items up or bagging their items in that time frame the customer and I would make each other's day some way somehow. I learned how to put others first and build strong communication skills while working for Publix by observing my co-workers and assisting customers. Like any other job there are going to be co-workers that are difficult to get along with, which kind of makes your job a bit more difficult and then there will be some that you get along with without any problems. However, I didn't allow the ones that made things difficult stop me from doing what I had to do.

good,"When I first started working for Publix it was a new experience for being that it was my first job ever. Days at first were short because I was still in school and they were strict with minors. Over time I started working longer days and evening closing sometimes which was cool to me. Management was always crazy because we always were getting new managers. The co-workers where great because Publix was an equal opportunity work place it was so diverse and we even had a few cool co-workers with mental disabilities who made working at Publix really special. The hardest part was when you got use to how one manager wanted things done, but, then they left and a new manager would come and switch things up. The most enjoyably part of working at Publix was holidays and decorating the store."

The manager was organized and inspired me to learn more at work.  The hardest part of the job was learning to prioritize my work since I am very focused at what I do.

I keep a clean register during work, before break, and before I go home. I also clean the store when I close. I have learned to be patient, listen to the customers and that customers always come first. My managers are awesome. They listen to me if I have a suggestion or a problem. And they always encourage me. My co-workers are awesome as well. They work with me to get the job done. So we are great at team work. The hardest part of my job is when a customer or co-worker moves away. Because I form an amazing bond with everyone so its hard for me when they leave. But I get through it because I know someone new is coming and I love to meet new people. The most enjoyable part of my job is engaging and serving the customers. It makes me happy to see them happy because of their satisfaction with the service I give them."

My boss is great and always backs us 100% as he knows we are in the front line of duty all day long.

I enjoy all of all of my co-workers and the fact they are like my second family! The hardest part of my job is the time away from my family.

I was young and just learning how to become a man but Publix had trust in me to some simple tasks as bagging the groceries, stocking the shelves and also retrieving the shopping carts from the parking lot. Even though people might think those tasks during my normal workday are simple it was a great responsibility for me. People trusted me everyday to bring the shopping carts back inside Publix without damaging the cars, I learned customer service skills by bagging the groceries and aiding people with their bags to their cars, I also learned a little about inventory stocking the shelves and making sure we had a good stock supply in the back."

The hardest part of the job for me was the possibility of not being able to satisfy my customers and co-workers needs at all times. In turn, when my customers were satisfied it made me feel as if I done my job and that was the most enjoyable part working."
good,"As a Publix employee, i face great challenges everyday and those challenges help me become a better person every day. I love the people i work with and it is time for me to move forward and find me a career oriented organization. The hardest part of my job is making everyone happy.

good,"Publix is a great company for those who are either students, or retired individuals. It offers flexible hours, but not sufficient to support someone with more than $500 cost of living."
good,It was fun working here. But also strict which I didn’t mind. The customers were great. Overall just a friendly place to work at and would definitely do it again.
good,All in all for me it was okay experience. Why I said okay because they don’t train you properly and poor management. There’s always a favoritism going on in every department.
good,"i enjoyed my time working for publix. it was my first job and it was a place that i got to meet all kinds of people, get a feel for a high energy job, and collaboration."
good,"although i love publix, as a part time, hours are very inconsistent, which had me look for another job where i am full time, im still with publix once a week because i love it and i love my co-workers , yes , you always get the lazy, worthless co workers but overall i love my store. manager wise i get along with mine and i love them but there is a lack of advancement, they always choose whoever they want to move up, there’s a lot of hardworking people who deserve to be promoted but often get overlooked, which is the second reason i ended up getting another job. publix is great though, if you’d like to start somewhere i would highly recommend this company. you also get dental and vision coverage even as a part time ."
good,Publix is a very upbeat and professional company to work for. All jobs revolve around pleasing customers in any way possible. Benefits outweigh the pay and numerous hours of hard work.
good,"Was a cashier and did customer service. Was working full time at Tervis and 20-30 hours a week at Publix. Publix is all about customer service, there isn't anything they won't do for their customers. It's quite impressive."
good,Publix is a good place to work if you’re looking for something part time. I was needing full time employment and the availability just wasn’t there for me. Part time employees are not eligible for any sort of insurance.
good,"The job was good if you wanted to go to go to another department you had the option to do so by getting cross trained. There was opportunity to move up and every 6 months to a year you you get a raise, and who doesn't want more money or the hard work they do."
good,I worked deli for two years. Really enjoyed my time. Learned so much about customer interaction and how to handle customers so that they leave satisfied.
good,"You get to know the people you work with very quickly, management is friendly . You meet many new customers that will treat you like a friend and are happy to see you"
good,"At the time the pharmacy district manager was awful. Her and previous was horrible and rude. They were fast to talk down to you and attempted to make you feel stupid. Expectations were crazy! You were held more responsible for other stores than your own! You (including me) could have data entry over 50% for other stores but if the whole pharmacy wasn't, full time employees got wrote up..crazy! They looked to fore older pharmacists as well."
good,Good place to work. Management work around your schedule and personal life. Friendly co- workers. Fun place. It's like a family. Good benefits and the pay could be better
good,"Publix was a great starting out job. I began as a bagger, and worked my way up to Customer Service. Proper training is provided, and being immersed directly with customers is very rewarding and challenging."
good,"Publix is a great job to work for . I cannot complain about the company . They have helped me in my time of need.  Being in Customer Service taught me something very valuable . To always be efficient and work at your pace with calm and ease , no matter how stressful the environment may be. When confronted in tough situations, it is best to listen . It can get you far. As for being currently being in the produce department , you must adjust to the pace and always tend to the customer's needs. Even if the product is not in your department. Nine times out of ten , A customer will always ask for  a product that is not in your department.  These past 3 years working for Publix has taught me tremendously . I don't regret working for them . However , It is time to advance to further ."
good,"Entering new prescriptions with pharmaceutical calculations. Structured workflow. Companies protocols must be followed. Generated labels, scanned products for accuracy and elimination of medication errors. Managing fast movers, counted pills, got medications ready for a final verification by the pharmacist, discharging medications to patients the point of sale, consolidated insurance claims."
good,"My job, while very demanding, was doable and not so bad sometimes. I would be okay doing it again if necessary but the pay was mediocre. You can't make a living working at Publix unless you are management. You need to work multiple jobs or have someone supporting you while you work because it's not nearly enough to live on alone."
good,"Most managers work with you on your schedule, especially if you’re in school they will give you the hours you desire but still respect your time to study and go to classes. Publix promises job security and it’s a easy place to grow and get promoted within the company."
good,Publix is an awesome place to work. Great for networking and building relationships. The management is awesome and they really care about their people.
good,"I work in the Publix Deli where the work is very fast paced and at times very stressful. You are to slice meats and cheese in the traditional section for customers and attempt to do so in a quick and professional manner. Every four hours the slicer are to be washed and sanitized."
good,"Assisted bagging groceries in bags for customers, most who were seniors by helping and placing the bags in their vehicles. Part of the job was also to mop the store floor, clean bathrooms and assist customers whenever needs arose."
good,The management is highly strict but other than that it is a good job with few benefits. You meet many people of different cultures and they are all very cooperative when it comes to bagging
good,"For the most part, Publix is a very friendly environment. They have a lot of training to make sure employees keep things clean and customer's feeling happy. "
good,Very good company to work for but pay should be better and hours are not enough and full time is super hard to get into. Publix  is too systemated it should be more management trustworthy.
good,"Un día típico en el trabajo es marcar la entrada y atender a las personas que necesiten ayuda ,por ejemplo para devolver algo que compraron"
good,"in season customers are colorful"
good,It takes a couple of years to get full time benefits and made me hours. Leaders need more training to be able to train new employees..upper management need too be sure they have all training
good,No type of respect.Even though you rigght and the customers wrong they always right which I don’t have no problems with.Overall it’s a good place to work but the salary is ummm let say not that good
good,"When it comes to Publix and being a Floridian, it's more or less being like a rite of passage to have worked at Publix for a short period of time and being one of the first serious jobs taken on. The company is amazing when it comes to customer service and making sure that the customer leaves happy."
good,"I loved my job , I just retired early cause I needed the money, great job , good people and lots of money to be made .plus at the time my whole family worked with me and that made it just that much better for me."

good,Me sirvió de mucho para mejorar el dominio del idioma ingles y a su vez tener mejores relaciones con los clientes.
good,"I was hired at Publix as a Front service clerk, which was slow most shifts. I transferred into the Deli department because I prefer to stay busy, and there are many things to do throughout the day. The morning crew would handle the production to insure we were prepared for the customers arrival. In order to close the deli there is a rigorous process of cleaning. There are dishes to wash, trash to be taken out to the compactor, and the floors need to be scrubbed. The hardest part of the day would be balancing customers and online orders. If needed managers don't hesitate to jump in if they are available, because customers come first. It's very satisfying when the customers compliment the work i do for them."
good,"very productive and fixed hours included when working for publix, i just felt the need to leave for personal advancement and a change of pace in jobs."
good,Publix is an overall good company to work for. There are various opportunities to move up with in the company. Cross training is also available to publix associates. Payroll is weekly. You don't have  to be full time to receive benefit you just have to have worked a certain amount of hours within a year.

good,Public was a great first job to learn how to properly deal with costumers in a mature and polite manner. Public's main focus was and has always been on satisfying the costumer.
good,I had one manager  who profiled me the entire time. I was a great employee but he still found anything to nip pick at. He was rude and unprofessional.
good,"working at publix sometimes can be crazy , rude customers.Mangers are sometimes rude as well too , no room for growth .6 years working at publix , didn't think it would last that long"
good,"Great company, cares about employees, great stock options. This company is a great place to start as a first job, and you can very well end up a millionaire if you work hard to become a manager and use your stock options wisely"
good,I come into work ready and focused. Some people that work there are nice and polite and others are not. The most enjoyable part is when customers ask when i work and they try to shop when i am working.
good,All and all a good company to for you. Everyone is always helpful to their customers. Management is always willing to listen to any areas of concern staff has.
good,A typical day at work would be clocking in and starting my job with a smile. While working I enjoy having a conversation with the customers while checking their items
good,"typical day at work, I greet customers, scan their items, bag their items.  I like talking to customers about their day, I don't like when customers are grumpy and don't feel like talking.  Part time employees don't get benefits and right now scheduling is low to around 2-3 days a week.  The hardest part of the job is being on your feet for 6-8 hrs."
good,"Great Company to work for, wonderful benefits and great people to work with as well. Didnt pay much or gave much hours but nothing was wrong with the job. Wish I could of stayed longer but good memories by the most part. Very organized place plus clean. Professional customer service."
good,"They weren't bad, but has room for improvement. The Pharmacy has issues with staffing properly and keeping their Pharmacy Managers happy. But for the most part they were a good company."
good,Giving premier customer service and working in a very busy environment is very important to me.  Publix is a great company to work for. I loved interacting with customers while working.
good,Some departments are better than others to work in and there are some really good mangers that want to see advance and will help you.
good,It is a good company to work for when it comes to benefits and everything is you get full time. Very hard to get. I love working here they have given me my skills to further my career choices.
good,"Working for publix is a fun and secure job. I worked in customer service, so I saw the best and worst of people. Managers can be tough to work with, but not all are. Overall a good company to work for with decent benefits."
good,It is an easy job. Liked working there.The co-workers and managers were decent. Can advance if you apply for it. Paid decently. 401k and retirement plan. Flexible hours.
good,"The company is great and has many ideas on how to support their associates, however the local and direct management aren't living up to them."
good,"On a typical day at work, I will arrive at 10 a.m. I will look at the schedule to know what my job role is for the day. Mostly my shifts are behind the customer service counter. I interact with my coworkers and mangers very closely throughout the day to achieve the highest quality of customer satisfaction. There are no parts of my job that is hard because I have been there long enough to know how to do my job without any difficulties The most gratifying part of my job is knowing that I have done everything in my power to make the customers happy."
good,"Enjoyed time there, felt a little mislead on potential to move up. left after over 2yrs being part time. couldnt stand the store manager either. Loved the customers and respected all the co workers. really wanted full time and reality was that particular store didnt see the potential of me as an employee even though the customers saw it. no regrets working there. would go back to the company just not that particular store."
good,Very good place to work. Treats associates very well very busy but is very pleasurable. Customer come from all over just to shop here.
good,It is a great part time job to get though school and If you enjoy retail be all means stay.Publix has great benefits if you are willing to put in the time.
good,Good place to work. Total focus on good customer service. Team oriented with consistent customer satisfaction. A relaxed atmosphere for a pleasant working experience
good,i have learned not to be so shy and talking to people more. i usually clean the first half of my shift and then bag the rest of my shift.
good,I like talking to my customers and making sure they are happy with their shopping experience. I learn a lot about providing excellent customer Service it makes the customers alway want to come back to our store. My co-workers are all nice and friendly. What i hate about my job is you cannot take vacation when and how you want to take it. It really upset me. You work too hard to provide the best customer service and all the managers can give you is .25cent raise. It is insulting me. Some associate do not work weekends and nights and they still get to be in customer service. Managers are not fair to other asscociates.
good,Publix is a good company to work for with lots of advancement potential if you're willing to put the time in. Would go back to them if they offered me full-time.
good,I enjoy working with people. I'm very good at helping people enjoy there shopping experience.
good,Working for Dr Svensson was a good experience with billing and customer service.  A much slower pace job with a lot of down time.  I enjoyed meeting and knowing all of our clients.  This allowed me to understand their needs.
good,"A typical day at work consists primarily of checking in truck drivers and their loads and checking them out. We enter the data into the computer and instruct the driver on where they have to pick-up or drop off a load. Responding to warehouse emergencies and patrolling the premises to deem the area safe. I must also document the day's activity in a Daily Activity Log."
good,the management change that I got was terrible. The new assistant manager did not value my work.
good,"If the pay was better, I'd still be there, but it takes forever to make any money there.  "
good,"A day at work is usually okay very slow because of the times I work. I learned to be a better leader especially when it comes to helping employees and cutomers. Management wasn't to good, Their wasn't a hard part to the job. Most enjoyable part was coming to work."
good,"As I still work at Publix, I must admit that I harbor no ill feelings toward Publix. However, while the benefits are fabulous, as is the working atmosphere, Publix retail stores are not very accommodating to anyone who needs full time employment and has familial responsibilities."
good,"I enjoyed my job, did not get a enough hours need a full time job."
good,"What ive learned as a publix worker alot of customer service,the customer is always right no matter what. I think the most hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers but you learn to deal with things in a better manner to make the customer happy. My most enjoyable part of the job is making a customers day just knowing i came in and did my job to put a smile on someone face."
good,"year"
good,"Its a great place to work, especially starting off. i would recommend. Only problem is a lot of times people get favored more due to relationship with others and get there way."
good,"The pay and benefits are honestly pretty good.  However, I find myself more stressed than I would like to be currently and think that a change is due.  Also, my sleep cycle is currently all over the place and schedule usually keeps me away from home for 12-16hrs.  My off days are frequently spent trying to catch up on sleep."
good,"This is just one of those places that you know will not be your last job. It is retail and unless you want to stay with the company forever, they will not move you up."
good,"Publix is a great place to work for, with most if not all employees being polite and friendly. The managers can be lackluster, but a majority are good."
good,"The changing hours every week was a problem for me, that means expecting they will keep changing your schedule, if you like it’s fine, but stressful.After 90 days you can change it for a stable work schedule .Do your work as you suppose to do, move and being helpful everywhere, listen what they told you to do.Always put the Customers first, listen what they want and do it.You good to go."
good,"When hired I was promised 35 plus hours a week, Ended up being an average of 28 week, Only time I was given more hours is when another department employee went on vacation or was out sick, Reason I left. Hours given to a training employee and the fact I couldn't live off of 28 hours a week.."
good,"With my experience of 20+ years, this industry does take a toll on you. You have to make sure you put in place a work life balance. The benefits are very completive to other grocers"
good,Nice warehouse job great benefits well paying sometimes the hours can be a bit lengthy and can cut into personal life but overall great company that gives you stocks which is a great benefit
good,Advancing was always a possibility and the company is great. I learned how to handle stressful situations being a cashier by knowing that the managers had my back and were willing to help out.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Publix.  They're a great place to work.  At times they can be one sided on promotions, depending on the job. Overall I enjoyed my time with them."
good,The job overall was good with it being my first job and it lasting for four years. Like there were a good amount of quality and effective performance in there.
good,I loved the environment at Publix.  I have never worked for a company that was so Customer Service driven.  I would still be working there if I did not have to relocate. You could easily retire a millionaire if you made a career at Publix.  Best company I have ever worked for.
good,"Publix was a great place to work, I hated to move out of a state that did not have one to work for. Management worked with you and along side you. Benefits were great as well."
good,"I love working at Publix as a cashier, however, I was hired for seasonal only; this position expires in April. If needed at another Publix I would gratefully  accept the position.  I love my managers & fellow associates at my Publix. I am not looking for advancement as I am retired; I am just looking for part time work to supplement my income."
good,"On my typical day at work I stayed busy, focused and cheerful regardless of the surroundings. Management had ups and downs, but the hardest part was keeping up with the inconsistency of the hours given to me. I would say the most enjoyable part of my day was coming in contact with the customers I would meet and building that customer, employee trust bond. I was able to take care of their questions and concerns in a timely manor."
good,"I am working in the deli department so my review is very bland and stressful sounding. The deli is very hard labor work, but if you’re fast and can pick up easy on tasks then it’s a great job for you!"
good,Good company to work for has alot potential benefits and of course stock ownership. Easy to advance if you put the work in.i started out as a part time cashier within 2 months i was training to be registered pharmacy technician inside the pharmacy after 6 mos training i took the teat and got state registered after 1 yr i chose to get certified . love our customer interactions. U dont walk in and hear emoyees comaining about there jobs like some of the competitor's ive been in.
good,Bring Publix’s back to what gorge Wanted it to be. Publix seed to be all about making it feel like fAmily and it is not anymore the just see you as a number and treat you like you are a mechine and not a human being
good,I love to cook for my customers. Enjoy my co-workers. Good benefits. They care about their employees. Great location. I Love my schedule .Close to home
good,I was 16 at the time but it was a great job for me to only be 16 I had a great manager who understood if I need to leave r take off I was only 16 so school came first
good,Great coworkers make working fun. Work hours can vary from week to week. Expectations are sometimes above what a normal person can accomplish in a given work day.
good,Overall fun. Great company. It is hard to get promoted at Publix. But is a great comepany to work for if you are in retail......................:.....
good,very friendly town to live in so the customers and employees are incredibly nice and make great work companions. the all around attitude at the work place was perfect.
good,"Publix is a daily task, to ensure the customers are satisfied. To make sure that the customer request has been meet, completed in a timely manner. Learn about the cooking, inventory,counts and replenishing goods on the floors."
good,"It was my first job experience. It was fine at first and overall a pleasant experience. My reviews could be harsh though and, from my perspective, biased. Still it was steady work while I could manage it."
good,Learned inventory control and all forklift operations here. Doc coordination and leader ship skills here. Work culture is a wide variety. All the associates are amazing and diverse like a family. Hardest part of the jobs here is dealing with certain management teams that dont know what they are doing or take advantage of their power and abuse it to the best of their ability. Most enjoyable part of this job is performing outstanding customer service and helping associates solve problems.
good,Customers can be difficult but as a employee of Publix you must always work calmly and efficiently. I have learned to do this EXTREMELY well. I am attentive and friendly.
good,Fast paced environment with incredibly tedious rules. Great place for a first job. Was taught wonderful customer service skills and cleaning skills. Would recommend if you are looking for a job with benefits.
good,Great stores great benefits a little hectic at times but great company. U must be a hard worker n have an open availability to make it in this company
good,"Friendly environment, worked as a cashier, often times bagging groceries as well, responsible for keeping area clean and aisle next to register stocked."
good,"Its an alright place to work, if you want to dedicate your life to it you can advance, most managers had over 25 years with the company, that's a lifetime for a young person with bigger goals."
good,"Working at Publix over all wasn't to bad. The people were nice, the work wasn't hard, and once you get full time you get a lot more benefits. It was a good place to work."
good,open mid closing. train new members in the kitchen how o use slicing machine monitoring stock FIFO .Got promoted to baker.went and train new stores in the area.No hard just follow specs .Teach new members of the team .
good,It is a good place to work and good benefits and pay. Can advance there and will help you go back to school. You can transfer if needed. raises every 6 months
good,My store was at one time a very great place to work but overtime they sent all the managers that got demoted or in trouble to it because it was a lower volume store and that’s how publix punishes managers. They make you take a pay cut and will make you drive as far as possible away from your home.
good,I love Publix and recommend it to Anyone. It is a great place to show your strengths with customers and to learn responsibilities as a worker there. 10/10
good,Publix is a very good company to work for. There is always room for advancement and the pay rate increases upon your evaluation every 6 months. The only bad thing is it's rare to be hired at a Full Time Rate
good,I do like Publix but I just don’t have enough hours and I want to get a house and start my future Publix can’t pay me enough for that. I’m thinking about working at Publix at least two days and the rest as pet care.
good,I enjoyed working at Publix.  They just could not offer full time.  Hours were very flexible.  My management team was wonderful.  The only thing I did not like was when I had to block the shelves.
good,"A typical day at the workplace would include checking out customers, helping customers find items needed, stocking and cleaning. You learn how to count and handle money regarding cash, checks and cards."
good,I have been working there for 3 & 1/2 years. I have learned a lot about multitasking and have seen personal growth within myself. You get the hours that you ask for and it's a pretty fun job. it's a lot on your feet and lots of storewide work.
good,"Good place to work. I Got paid weekly, and the store was close to my home. The people I worked with we're great, everyone worked as a team. Management was very helpful."
good,"It was a good place to work for. very good training. Great benefits, and great atmosphere. Enjoyed working there. Enjoyed  job that I had working there."
good,"i worked at publix as a seasonal job spring and summer of 2017, and was laid off at the end of the busy season. i enjoyed working there, butKroger is located right across the street from where i live now"
good,I had been employed with this company for 3 years the first two years were great. I was initially a cashier moved up to customer service staff which i was briefly trained in and then trained in the bakery department when i experienced the poor management.
good,"Set to work upon entering the business, learned to use a more modern register, liked the cashiering, hardest part of the job was the computer training that is necessary for the job, employees good to one another and help as needed."
good,From the online application to in person interview  to team building skills at the orientation i knew what the job entailed  and was everything i expected
good,"I enjoyed working for Publix, there is opportunity for growth within the company.  Publix is a fun place to work the staff was excellent. The hardest part of the job was keeping the unsatisfied customers happy."
good,"I've always looked forward to coming to work, everyone is so helpful and kind. They give you tools to succeed, lots of support. I was mostly alone in my department, I got things done and worked hard to provide and keep Publix to it's name, serving quality and maintaining a pleasurable shopping experience for customers. I've always loved shopping at Publix, working with them was something I'll never forget. They gave me so much experience and taught me a lot about striving for excellence."
good,Great place for a first job out in the public. A great learning experience.   I enjoyed helping people and enjoyed working there.  I have learned a lot since I have been employed there.  The hardest part of the job is standing on my feet all the time.  The most enjoyable part is  being around people and feeling needed.
good,"Good place to work, I was a cashier/bagger. I was payed pretty well especially since they give raises every six months if you are a good employee and I was there almost 5 years."
good,"Publix is a good place to work, especially for women. The work is tough but the customers are worth the effort. The store is always clean and organized and for the most part, employees are very dedicated however the health insurance issue for part time employees is a big issue."
good,"Meet and greet different people"
good,well sometimes u would go in at 8 am or by 10am that is what i have schedule and work a basic 7-10 hours daily shift depends also i was crossed traine
good,"It was an ok job but I wasn’t making enough money for all the work I did every day. I asked for a raise and was denied. I was the lowest paid in customer service staff, (with all my training completed)even when they constantly told me how they love my attitude and work ethics."
good,Working at Publix is most of the time just like advertised that working (like shopping) at Publix is a pleasure. The management is good (with only two exceptions in my personal experience). I rate Publix a very good place to work and shop. Most all of the managers I felt were fair and good to work for. I do recommend Publix as a good place to work to anyone seeking employment.
good,The other employee were nice from time to time. The management there all ways tried there best to make things work for you. Over all it was as fun as it was stressful.
good,"I worked full time as a deli clerk averaging 40 hours every week, I was also enrolled in college so my life was pretty consumed by school and work. The atmosphere was great depending on coworkers of course and who the scheduled manager was for your shift. However since I've left there has been new deli managers so couldn't really say. As full time you have much more responsibility as filling the floor, doing counts, organizing coolers, breaking down trucks, I recommend this position for those who like the leadership role and plan to move up with the business as they promote from the inside. This is a typical retail environment so you will deal with rude customers or very picky customers. The most hectic time is winter when the snowbirds are down but throughout the year its a pretty consistent heavy flow of customers. Overall with the right coworkers and mindset this bad is not bad at all. I started as part time receiving 9.50 hr with 25 cent raises every six months I was promoted to full time with in the first year my ending pay was 11 hr. I left due to complications with the store manager and constant misunderstanding as well as some unprofessional acts however my main reason was to complete schooling and go on to my career."
good,"Publix is a great company to work for. Their benefits are second to none even for the part time employee who qualifies under the minimum requirements.  There is room for advancement in most departments.  As managers in all departments seem to be a revolving door, the non management associates that remain bond as a family as they are the true foot soldiers holding the daily flow together.  It is this inner culture of teamwork and togetherness that makes this company a great place to work."
good,You will learn good customer service practices working for Publix. The job has opportunities to advance if you want to advance to management. Publix is a great first job.
good,I enjoy working at Publix because I get to interact with customers and stay busy all through the day. The people I work with are great and make for a comfortable place to work at.
good,"When working as a publix deli associate, remember that a sense of urgency is always needed to help the lines of customers each and every day that come to the store."
good,Good for people in high school or retired people who want extra cash. Not too reliable but a good place to work. Whether the job is enjoyable or not is up to the employee. It is a job for a reason.
good,nice place to work if youre young or old in between may be challenging without a second job or another source of income. wish there was am easier way to get full time
good,"The staff is amazing, they were very flexible with hours. The only negative thing is the compensation was very low. Everybody generally worked as a team and was very supportive of one another"
good,"Great place to work for skill building. Was my first job and cannot be more thankful for the leadership that I was shown. However, it is such a drag to work there. Days go by so slowly."
good,publix is hands down the best food retailer in the contry and they have the best benefits available. this is a great place to work and the pay is hands down the best.
good,"Publix is well known for it's superior customer service and long tenured empolyees and rightful so. This company gave me a great start into my personal professional career and it was a wonderful experience. The work in it of it self was hard at times, what with trying to keep up with weekly sales and customer favorites, but it gave me the opportunity to hone in on my customer service skills and to properly prepare my sections for future specials. Publix certainly is a company and it was my pleasure to work there."
good,"good company to work for in grow with, there is room for advancement if you just show up in go above what is required of you, In remember customers is King."
good,This job helped me to get more comfortable talking to people and expanded my customer service skills. Management at my store was decent but some managers were lazier than others. The hardest part was being pregnant and having to help customers out to their car to unload their groceries.
good,i learned how to be responsible and helping others out and working as a team. i also was able to know how to work fast and i learned  new things every day about working .
good,Company prides itself on Customer Service.  Enjoy meeting the customers.  Job requires standing in one place for hours.  Employees would benefit with more water breaks/bathroom breaks.  Pay is just above average for area.  Pay should be increased for all employees to above average due to demands of the job.  Some Supervisors on Front End need training on how to manage a diverse staff.  The loss of a recent General Manager left big shoes to be filled.
good,I enjoy working at Publix however I am seeking more work hours and an environment where I can learn new skills and build on my existing skills. I am seeking part-time work also.
good,once we clock in our patience would just roll in. the job was during physical season so there were a ton of patients all day. I would see different patients between the ages of 4-18 years old.
good,"Publix has a great culture of premier quality customer service. They offer comparable benefits with regard to health, dental and vision plans. In addition, they offer a number of benefits like 401K and an ESOP. I must say the hardest part of the job is fitting in to the rather conservative nature of the company. The world is moving much more quickly than Publix's rather ""old-school"" attitude towards dress code and the ever changing make-up of the American people (i.e.) Men can't have beards or long hair. Tattoos are still seen as rather taboo to many in positions of high leadership. I was told by an Assistant Store Manager once that the reason we never sponsor our local Pride Parade in Jacksonville is because it's seen as ""Controversial"""
good,"supermarket store with a wide selection of groceries, plus deli & bakery departments.seafood and produce department. were crossed trained , so I am able to work any position within the store"
good,"I love my job, and I love the great people that I work with. I love that publix is flexible with hours. I have learned how to work a cash register. And how to provide premier customer service to every customer."
good,Working at Publix I learned to treat people the way I would like to be treated and good social ability with customers.The best part of the job was getting my little tips.
good,Great place to work but its only part time so some weeks you may only have one day on schedule.  It is hard to get in the management program.  Very hard to become a full time employee no matter how long you been there and or how good or bad work ethnics are.
good,Its a great company to work for and the people I work with are wonderful to work with. A typical day for me is always productive with staying busy meeting customer needs as well as maintaining premier customer service.
good,Making sure that there is product in the case for the customers to buy. I have learned a lot from my managers and co workers. Being able to work with customers is my favorite thing to do at a job.
good,"I worked for 10 years as a bagger, without any chance to move up the chains. I was unable to do anything more than just bagging."
good,"Publix was my first job, i started as a bagger then eventually moved a cashier. The advancement takes some time but is definitely worth it long term. I also got to experience how stock was, which was a good push towards learning other departments at once and not just learning one"
good,"i lean so fast,good people,safe enviroment,friendly co workers,fast paced line,i was a muffin packer,then a produce snack packer"
good,"I would watch the front , create scheduales, push carts , count tills, stay and answer phone calls. I loved this job just not enough hours."
good,"If employes I worked with were team players it was a breese, but if not made job harder. Really liked my co-manager,customer service reps were nice, store manager was the best.Lots of cleaning but I am good at that."
good,"there is no typical day in my area.   everyday is a different day.  new claims are received.  at this time I complete my investigation and contact the attorney to obtain bio, allegations and injuries.  I then assess the file and determine the liability.    continue to follow up with atty and collect all evidence.  once PFS is received then review and start negotiations."
good,"I was a bagger at Publix, I enjoyed helping customers out to their car, and having a nice conversation with them. I enjoyed working for the company and I still enjoy shopping there as well."
good,"A typical day at work for me is usually a learning experience. Working around the public you never know what to expect. If there is a lot of work during the day time goes by faster. Most customers who shop at the store know what they want. Eventually you will began to recognize repeat customers. Management at the workplace is usually friendly. Since I am well trained I rarely need them for help, but if a situation occurs where I need there assistance I wont hesitate call them over. If  there is a certain protocol or rule to remember management will remind you. Since this job requires me to work with the public my co workers must present themselves in a positive way.Most of my interactions with co-workers are positive. I understand that I am on the job to work and that I am above any conflict. The hardest part of the job for me is staying busy. Since our business is customer oriented, sometimes business can be slow. To pass the time I try to find something to clean or organize. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is meeting the different variety of people and satisfying our customers needs."
good,Publix offers their employees a wide variety of ways to advance. The benefits are excellent and it is a great place to work.
good,Working at Publix was a great working experience. I learned how to interact with the customers better and many other things. A typical work day was helping the customers with western unions or lottery. Publix always has the best Co-workers. Everyone always got along and helped each other when needed.
good,It was a great pleasure to work for one of the top rated grocery retailers in the country.  Great people. Atlanta Division and Company as whole had great leadership.
good,"it was a good experience, taught me a lot. Grew good relationships with my customers and former coworkers. Would recommend working there."
good,Open the store and dispense money to all registers. Assigned cashiers and baggers to their roles. Coworks were ranged from high school students to college and up. Picked up money at end of the day and balanced. Over saw the clean of the store as well as trained new employees.
good,"advancement is more than possible,if you pretend to be ignorant! Over all,co-workers are very like-able as-well as competent..."
good,a typical day at work dealing with the customers and laughter getting work done and getting the customers in and out.i learned that you have that your customers comes first.management is excellent..make sure they employees are fine....the most enjoyable part of my job is that my customers  are happy and satisifed
good,"my review is just im aluable to work with any company and to be the best employee they never had and publix is a very good company for people to work with their co-workers they very friendly always try to help you when you need help with what you doing."
good,"I did cashiering, price scanning, and also receiving.  I enjoyed my job and knew there were chances of advancement"
good,stock unloading truck help customer I learn a lot work there the management had there good and bad days I work with go co-works do a lot of work long hours I enjoyable get off
good,It was a great first job. I made many mistakes and was forgiven.  My work was valued and there was clear opportunity of advancement.
good,"I obtained great knowledge when I worked for Publix, lalthough the management didn't assist a lot I enjoyed my customers the most."
good,I think this company is good to work for. The two best things about this job is that you can have some health issues within reason and be a little mentally challanged. I dont know of any other job that is like this store.
good,"Fast work pace, able to deal with different kind of people and cultures"
good,"A Typical Day In The Deli Consist of Building Subs, Slicing Cold cuts, Party Trays. Cleaning."
good,Good workplace but unfortunately did not compensate their employees enough.
good,"Having to move from a Bagger to a Cashier was very stressful in the beginning. However I had the best co-workers and managers that helped me in the things I had no knowledge of and I quickly adapted from them. A typical day at work was to greet customers,asked if they found everything they were looking for, ring up their items and thank them for shopping there and ask to please come again. the most enjoyable part of the job is working with my favorite managers and co-workers."
good,Filling customers orders. Anserwing phones. Closing and cleaning .
good,Love working love the employees the customers are super friendly my coworkers are great
good,"Greet and assist customers; weigh, scan, and package groceries; handle cash and operate terminal. Keep Cashiers and Front Service Clerks on task.Perform all front service functions such as copying, ordering supplies, faxing important documents and handle a variety of other clerical tasks as assigned"
good,"I enjoyed my job.But as i worked there,I realize that I loved the medical field better."
good,I started working there when I was 15 years old. I learned alot from working for the company. I was able to learn how to planagram and work has a team to get things done in a timely manner. My coworkers were always fun to be around so that helped the mood a lot of the store. Management was helpful in making sure that you understood day to day action there.
good,This was my job as a teen it was fun learning the business. It was my first job and I love it.
good,"I loved working here but it did get stressful at times, because we got deadlines to do so many things in so much time."
good,"You control your schedule when you are part time a bit but if you have limited availability, don't expect a lot. "
good,Great place to work especially if you need a job while in school like i did. The store i worked at was so nice and management was good to everyone but i have heard stories of other stores brought down by management positions  being horrible to employees
good,"Publix has hired TOO many people, so we are not getting enough hours, For Week 11/16/2019 my total net scheduled hours are 7.25, 1 day only so far.  I have spoken with my manager, and the person she told me to talk to, about getting loaned out to work more hours at another location that is closer to where I live, and I have heard nothing so far.  I have gone so far as to fill out a form to switch locations of where I work to the store closest to me.  We shall see.  But, all said it is a great pretty store."
good,Hours are erratic. Hard to get full time with benefits. My grocery managers are extremely efficient and work alongside us to make sure tasks are complete and to company standards.
good,"Its a very good job to work at. Its just the hours you would do. I work in the Fresh Kitchen and the start time is 5am till finish . So sometimes we would leave early off work or sometimes we would leave super late. I need a job knowing what time i will be home . Its somewhat unorganized, and we never get to go home at our 8 hours sometimes. We usually do around 10-12 hours daily. Im starting school so i cant do all these hours"
good,Publix is a great company with great benefits. My only issue is the work hours. One day you’re working at Night till midnight the next morning you have to come right back at 7am. No work life balance.
good,"Working at publix was fun and chaotic in a good way. All the associates care about customers but customers never seemed to care about the workers. working there taught me to have patience and to never let negative people rent space in my thoughts. However, that was the hardest part: not letting mean words get to you. But with all the difficulties of working at Pubix there came many more enjoyable parts. One of those parts, for me, was having all cash registers open on an extremely busy day (usually sunday) and getting to greet so many people with positivity and joy. Time usually went by much faster when things were busy."
good,"The company provides health insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance, 401k with 50% match, retirement fund paid in company stocks, Christmas bonus up to two weeks pay, 5 or 6 paid holidays, sick time up to 8 days a year, up to four weeks vacation based on time with company"
good,Publix is a good company to work for they will give you the hours you ask for. They are also really good at understanding if you have another job or two.
good,it’s was a good place to work i wa a happy new driver to the car play and it is so much better then it again to the car play it is hard for you guys wanna was the best
good,"Nice place to work. Family type atmosphere. Management cares for associates. Advancement opportunities are sometimes emotionally driven, but fair overall."

good,love the environment everyone is friendly. The job is pretty easy to do if you love to clean an communicate with others. We also get training to keep us updated with the products.
good,Publix wants nothing more then effort and customer satisfaction. It is their pleasure to make your shopping experience great! typically publix has great energy.
good,Same old grocery store everywhere you go. They push for efficiency and customer service above all else and it's a very conservative environment. It's got good full time benefits but they promote from within
good,Publix was a great place to work I enjoyed working with my managers and other employees if it wasn't that I had moved to a different area I never would have left
good,"Working at Publix can be a challenge at times but it's worth it. It's always busy, they get the worst rush hours. I've learned to be patient, to work fast. and mange your time wisely,"
good,Overall great company  enjoy my time working there been there almost 7 years benefits are great I would’ve still be working there if it wasn’t for the situation that happen
good,Ideal for a first job or a relaxed job. They are extremely flexible and train well. Its difficult to advance in some departments and easier in others. It is all about whether you put in the work or not. If you work hard than it shows in how well Publix treats you. Retail hours are a bit tough for a young family.
good,Publix gives long shifts and late shifts. But the weekly pay is a benefit and the people you meet there are all great. Would recommend for a first job.
good,"I Honestly Like Working At Publix , Very Interesting Though I Love My Coworkers A lot & My Manger , Sometimes I Get A Little Tab Be Lazy  & Procrastinate But I Get The Job Done ."
good,Pulled produce orders using a double jack(pallet jack). Very stressful and  competitive job. The quicker you build a pallet(order) the more money you could make.
good,"demonstrating food and or products, cleaning keeping all policy standards in check, management works with all employees to ensure all training and employee needs are met."
good,"There is room for advancement with in Publix it's a good company to work for they have many different departments to work in. They offer Medical Insurance ,401k match, long term disability, dental, life insurance, vision. Paid vacations, sick leave"
good,Most days were predetermined so any change was met with enthusiasm. The comradery amongst the employees was exceptional. The most difficult task each day was trying to please everyone.
good,Publix promotes from within which is amazing.  Work hard and they provide well for your future.  Retirement is amazing however the work balance especially if you have younger children is tough for them.
good,Loved my job here. Team work was great. Great benefits and pay for a grocery store. Deli manager was so mean. She loved nit picking on people. She made good days go bad every time We worked together
good,"I really enjoyed working at pubix , learned a lot about Baking, pre-pairing for next day prep, decorating cookes and cakes,, slicing bread ,selling product and serving customers. great crew!!"
good,"Publix was a fast-paced working environment, stressing at times. Working with customers was at times difficult. Ones body accomodates to the hours standing and shifts can be long. Overall a decent experience."
good,"Publix is a great place to work. They are one of the top company with the benefits, but could be less expensive. The stock is the best. There is room for growth in the company in various rolls. Sometimes management can be a bit stand offing."
good,"High-stress low pay starting out, as time goes it gets a little better but the hustle never ever stops. I really believe managers should take a project management course."
good,Love Publix. Just would like to raise my kids great pay lots of opportunities to grown with in the company.                                           .
good,"When I began at Publix, employee stock options were available. I like that the company is employee owned, although the policy on bonuses had changed in a less positive way."
good,"A typical day at work involved helping costumers as well, as maintaining the clean and in order for costumers to have a good shopping experience. It taught how to communicate with people and how to keep them satisfied in their shopping experience. The hardest part of the job were the hours. Hours were flexible but I wasn't given enough hours. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was talking to the costumers, meeting new people, an having the opportunity to talk and work with them."
good,You always stay busy the whole time and you have the opportunity to move up as long as you doing what you are supposed to be doing. Sometimes management can be a pain to deal with but that's my only negative.
good,It’s a nice job everyone there is really nice people there and the staff everyone works together well and they keep the store clean and organised making the work environment better
good,Management gets switched out very regularly. Never get too used to a certain manager. Equal opportunities for all employees. Full-time benefits are great. Part-time does not receive benefits besides owning stock. Too many employees in customer service and not enough in all other departments. The hourly pay is not great for a living wage.
good,"good place to work, but raises dont come often enough and often times you're overworked if you're in the deli. benefits are great if you qualify for them."
good,It is a great place with great benefits. I lived that I could meet new people everyday. I also loved talking with our regulars. You really get to know customers there.
good,Nice clean working environment but NO employee discounts. Way to many managers and supervisors an very low pay for the workload that is expected of employees.
good,"come in and work your shift then go home. I learned how to bag up groceries, how to cook meals from a recipe, how to retrieve carts. management is good, it depends on the publix and the relationship between you and the store manager. If you get along with management plan to be there for a while, if not, it was a good run while it lasted. hardest part of the job was always keeping a positive look on my face even when I was having personal and work issues. most enjoyable part were the group of people my age that made it enjoyable"
good,I loved working for this company. I was able to transfer with ease without losing any seniority as I traveled for internships during school. My managers were inspiring and knowledgeable.
good,"It was an ok job.  Had to move a bit at the time,  transferring kids school etc. Had to relocate at the same time back to DeKalb county and was a long way of commute."
good,"Publix can be a good job if you're in it for the long haul. You have to do whatever the managers want to get full-time, otherwise it's unheard of. Positive environment and management keeps hospitality towards the customers and associates on the top of their list."
good,Publix was my favorite place to work . I did it for 6 yrs and had a bad miscommunication with a manager that led to my termination. i truly enjoyed my 6 yrs there and hope that one day i can get back to them.
good,Focus on customer service and productivity. Meeting customers from different cultures. Assisting customers with special needs.Coworkers were helpful. Excellent reputation in the community for quality services and products.
good,"Taking out the trash , sweep the whole store also mopping , find where to put things when there out of place , getting the carts , walking people to there car and putting the things in the car"
good,It's a great company to work for. I would recommend this company to my friends and family.  I am thankful to have been given the opportunity to work for Publix.
good,"loved there guidelines on helping customers, and how we stood out above all grocery stores, management was nice and we could easily get off if we needed"
good,"this is a seasonal job"
good,"It is very hard to average the amount of hours you'd need for important benefits like health insurance, but while in school or while looking for full-time computer work, it's a good place to be.  It pays better than most retail companies and offers more benefits."
good,"Productive work environment customer relations assisting customers with refunds, purchases, returns, carryout, great management, nice steady workplace ability to deal with all types of customers"
good,Great company I tore the left rotator cuff in the deli chicken cooler. The company paid all medical and after 2 years past the shoulder was not improving with the type of work required so i choose to leave the company. This is a great place to work.
good,"Starts off easy but due to the lack of enough workers, and managers who don't do their jobs well. We always left two hours late everyday. And we still haven't gotten new people, Its been 8 months now and we are still struggling."
good,"Competitive pay and very clean work environment."
good,They treat you like family. Pay is ok for retail. I learned how to climb the ladder in the company. Started as a cashier and ended as a front end coordinator.
good,"publix is very easy going and fun to work at but there is no discount so it kida sucks, the only thing you get is every month they give you a free coupon."
good,This is a fun job but fast paced and is hard work. It takes a special person to make it in the deli. Publix has high standards for their products and premier customer service is a must.
good,"A Typical day at work wound to prepare the slicers "
good,The work at Publix was fun and very interactive. Customers were usually nice and workers had great bonds and teamwork. Some managers could be uneasy to work with.
good,I enjoyed my time at Publix. Management require a lot of hours and they can be at times inconsistent hours of work. There are great opportunities for advancement however if you don't have an issue putting all your energy into your work. Many managers struggle though balancing family and work life.
good,"A typical work day at Publix would include bagging for customers, grabbing carts from the parking lot during down time. Stocking shelves with product that was taken off the truck that day. Helping departments that had an employee call off. I learned a lot about what a team oriented work place looks like and how to manage my time effectively with the tasks that were given / needed to be done. The workplace culture was upbeat and friendly. The hardest part of the job was maintaining a consistent number of hours due to the amount of employees working there. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people every day."
good,"My typical work day would include me greeting customers, and setting up orders for the next morning to be placed out on the shelves in the bakery. I also would take cake orders, and then record them in the system using windows. I would also give bakery items to customers, as well as placing names on cakes using icing."
good,Work place sustainable liked working there did like the people around me always causing problems for me for the most part I was always on time work place always clean.
good,"fun work place, long hours.  work starts at 4am till 2pm, unless the night shift doesn't show, then you work to 10pm and come back at 4am.  Management is stressed, weekly goals, inventory, surprise visits from warehouse."
good,The publix i worked at the deli management was terrible the rest of the staff is amazing . publix is an amazing company its just the people they hire .

good,"Publix has a great friendly and helpful environment. They are fair to their customers and employees. I would recommend working here to anyone, especially those that are looking for advancement in management."
good,"Any retail is a very difficult job, so don't work in any retail if you think you're going to relax and do a bare minimum. You'll see a lot of stupid people in two weeks than in your whole life, especially if you work in customer service."
good,If you are ambitious and work hard eventually you move up the ladder. This company can provide you with great retirement funds. Salary compensation is mostly seen at manager levels.
good,Great place to work for students in need of a flexible schedule. The managers were always friendly and understanding. A bit competitive when it comes to promotions into management.
good,"Like to work with the public, like working as a cashier and fast-paced job. I have the experience and know what I'm doing and enjoy doing it. Publix is a nice place to work with good people. Fun environment and great management. I also do great working on the co purer doing data entry I enjoy this as well."
good,"I love to work with people and the day is great. I learned how to use machines to cut deli items, how to cut fruits and arrange platters. The management is excellent. The hardest part of the job is surviving with an inconsistent schedule. The most enjoyable part is putting together the presentation of my work, by putting in work and putting attention to detail, I am proud to show my work."
good,"Deli asst. Sliced meat an cheese. Ordering,pull truck,stock up.Made trays, Customer service.Cashier, Short order cook. Demo food. fried food. did every thing in the Deli"
good,It was a very laid back and friendly environment. It was very easy to approach a manager or coworker for assistance or just to talk to on a slow day. Overall great experience for an entry level job.
good,"The easiest part about having a job as a loyal employee of over two years was dealing with poor management & angry customers, once you're past that, you're golden!"
good,"Publix pharmacy is known for its outstanding customer service they provide the community. It is a very friendly place to work at. The management provides associates with the resources and tools to perform daily tasks. These tasks, consists of providing supreme customer service to patients while providing them with necessary medication needed in their lives."
good,"Publix is a great place to work and overall I enjoyed it very much. A typical day for me would consist of receiving our trucks from the warehouse distribution and breaking down pallets and loading freight onto carts. I would then take product to the sales floor and stock shelves according to core standards. I also would help level the store throughout the day, assist customers in their shopping experience and needs, as well as helping out the front end and customer service with bagging and collecting carts as needed. I learned many things along the way with my journey working for Publix such as doing inventory counts and operating a forklift. Management was touch and go as this is common; some are better than others. The workplace culture was very good and most associates with whom I worked with were always kind and respectful. I would say the hardest part of this job would be the constant standing, lifting, and repetitive motions throughout the day. The most enjoyable part of this job was interacting with many great customers and associates alike, which helped me become a better people person and communicator."
good,"worked for the company for three years, overall I liked it, customers were pleasant and management was nice, however no benefits for part time employees, however great company to work for."
good,A Company I Work For And I'm Looking For More Opportunities To Grow And Be Successful Just Trying To Make A Way For My Family I'm Moved From Florida But I'll Be Moving Back ASAP
good,"A typical day at work includes a stocking shelves and greeting every customer. While at this job i learned much about organization. The hardest part of the job is the strain that is put on your body, mainly your back. The most enjoyable part of the job to me is helping customers."
good,I love working for the company it is a good company to work for. Good benefits for both part time and full time associates. I been working for the company for almost 10 years we do have luncheons towards the holidays. Maybe every other month they give us free items that we could purchase at the store.
good,"Enjoy getting to know familiar faces and learn the Publix motto(s)"
good,"A typical day at work for me with Publix consisted of loading and unloading trucks, leveling, cleaning, providing exceptional customer service, and stocking product to shelves on the sales floor. I learned many new things while working for Publix including new ways to scan and track inventory as well as proper product rotation to ensure earlier sell by dates were always stocked most recent and later sell by dates were stocked to the back. The workplace culture at Publix is simply the best you could hope to find. Both associates and managers are always friendly, smiling, and willing to go above and beyond for customers. The most difficult part of the job I would say is not having a set schedule and the scheduling constantly changing; as a result it may become difficult to balance a work/home life routine. The most enjoyable part of working for Publix was certainly the friendly associates and the very good benefits including bonuses that we received several times a year. Additionally, I enjoyed my daily tasks as a grocery clerk placing product to the sales floor; it gave you a sense of accomplishment every day."
good,Publix is a great place to work! It is a very good Business to work for while in school because they work around your hours! The benefits are incredible but they take a lot of time and effort to get! If you want a career with Publix you will have to be willing to start from the bottom and work to the top! It takes years to become full time and then move on to management.
good,"Working for Publix was a great opportunity, I enjoyed working with such a great staff. I loved meeting new costumers each day, and helping them the best that I could."
good,Its a wonderful place to work .The management is okay great coworkers and environment. The Customers really become family.
good,Employee owned company so there is much pride in how things are done. Store located in high traffic area with foreign tourists. Very busy store
good,Deli department gets new managers frequently so your 6month raise varies. It's a good company but takes a long time to get full time. Some people working there get full time hours SOME TIMES but still no benefits even if they have been there more than 7 years!!!!
good,"I had a difficult time with remembering to card for lotto tickets so for that I was reprimanded oops, I felt the other ladies who were wanting to get into management in the store were not nice, they were very cut throat and this was unpleasant to be around.  The store closed at 9pm, but we wouldn't leave til midnight since we were responsible for perfecting every aisle in the store in addition to closing the money office and handling all those tasks before sealing the the safe.  I thought the management were overall disrepepectful, arrogant and pompous,"
good,"it was a great experience, im looking for something similar. It is such a great comapany an the goal is desired. ive been working for this company for over 10 years. the ceos are not as kind as your expect but the pay increase over time."
good,"Company's continuous training and ""customer service"" mentality has made it one the country's best. Customers love shopping there, mostly because of the friendly service from it's employees."
good,A typical day of work consists of a 6-8 hour day. For me my day consists of checking people out at the register. If they are short handed I will sometimes bag groceries and take them out for the customers. Overall I love my Publix team (co-workers) but the management is a little rocky. In the three years I have been there we have went through more than 6 customer service managers. The communication is not what I would hope for in a job like Publix. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers I assist. I love seeing the same customers over and over buying their groceries at a business like Publix.
good,I enjoy working at Publix because of the customers.  I never know who will walk through my line or how there day is going.  Every opportunity I challenge myself to make every customer have an awesome day.  I want their check out experience to be wonderful.  I work part time at Publix. I would like to make more money.
good,Publix has good benefits and works with the employees they have flexable hours which is good for students and for people that work another job
good,"The most important quality I gained working for Publix is customer service. Always putting the customer first and keeping them happy keeps them coming back every week. I believe this skill is one of the most important skills to have even in life. I have gained many management skills from my fellow managers, they have taught me just about everything I learned in the 5+ years spent there."
good,"I had troubles dealing with the management here because when you would have a problem with your direct supervisor, the supervisor above them wouldnt do anything."
good,Shopping is a pleasure when you are at Publix.  Employees are trained to give you outstanding customer service.  With all my years there I value the skills of customer service that Publix provided.
good,publix is a place of desire that i amire of it is a fun educating place for me to knowledge it would be great for me to keep working at publix for a long time because it would great to work there
good,"Publix is a wonderful company to work for. They have great benefits, stock, management, culture, and pay. Publix was hard to get into but once you do it is well worth your time and it is advised to stay with the company and take advantage of all the wonderful benefits they provide."

good,"I have been with Publix for 3 years, and during that time I have had the privilege to cross-train in every department. A typical day at work usually consists of helping customers locate specific products, special ordering products for them, taking phone calls and platter orders over the phone, greeting customers, and making sure that the customers had an excellent experience at the store. Over the years working here, I have learned how to deal with unhappy customers and keep them calm, I have learned how to manage a department on my own, and I have also learned how to train new employees. "
good,I enjoy the Customer service field it tends to be fast paced. Working in this field can be very repetitive but I don't mind it at all.
good,"llegar puntualmente al trabajo muy temprano en la mañana alas 4 am, revisar merecancia y articulos, su estado del dia anterior, llega el camion en la mañana y vamos a descargar la mercancia mientras que otros compañeros organizan adentro, a las 7 am, debo comenzar a trabajar elaborando unas 100  porciones en variededes de ensaladas de frutas, ir a almorzar y al regresar terminar de limpiar y trabajar en el inventario, a rededor de la 1 de la tarde , hora de ir a casa.   Aprendi a trabajar en equipo y compartir con los compañeros,  y del trabajo me gusto todo ya que lo disfrute al maximo y lo mas dificil tal vez fue al principio cuando no sabia como se hacian las cosas pero fue cuestion de tiempo y perseverancia."
good,"loved working at Publix,helping customers pick out and design cakes to fit their needs .very good customer service.their was always someone to help the customers."
good,Publix is a great provider however Fresh Foods is a little different. You go in not knowing what time your going to leave and i believe that was the hardest thing for me. The workload could be kind of tough at first but if you've worked in warehouse before you can do it.
good,Working at Publix helped me gain more customer service abilities and also helped me with my speaking to customers. I also gained a lot of relationships with customers that has came in the store.

Management can be up and down, but overall I work well with all. My co-workers are enjoyable, young, and old and full of life. The hardest part of my job is the hours I work. The most enjoyable part of my job is the friends I have made along the way everyday, whether they be customers or co-workers."
good,"great job, not a career,advancement was more based on who you know, not what you accomplish.changing departments was next to impossible,new hires would typically get requested positions."
good,"I have been there for many years. I enjoy it. But I have so many talents that being in just one place for so long I cant really express myself the way I would like. I want to help more ppl somehow. I want to experience other things and make more money. I want to be more independant. I want to try something other than retail. Its not publix that I do not like, Its the constant unloading trucks and my inner voice telling me I should be doing something else. I am very talented."
good,Publix is a positive place to work because your always smiling and helping people.The management wants you to learn and move up in the company.
good,"The work wasnt bad some of the supervisors had no clue what they were doing though. Overall not too bad too many people work there for you to really be picked on or examplified by management. "
good,I love working at Publix because I get to engage with other people all day long which makes my day go by a lot faster and smoother because I'm constantly busy. A typical day of work usually consist of me ringing up orders in an orderly place while trying to make sure the customer had an enjoyable experience shopping. My co workers are very easy to get along with. They are always there to assist when needed and my managers are always on time as well. The hardest part I would say of my day may consist of customers who haven't had the best experience shopping who had difficulties in other departments. I try to relax them to the best of my abilities and try to help to them find whatever item they may be missing or offer carryout service or store promise as a token of our apologies. The most enjoyable part of my day is when I can help a customers need get satisfied.
good,"Courteously greet customers and efficiently process transactions within a busy, fast paced environment.  Operate cash register, scanners and computers to itemize and total customer purchases.  Collect payments and distribute change for cash transactions. Also balance the cash drawer at the end of every shift.  Assist with store re-stocking, floor sets, and opening/closing procedures."
good,"Attending to customer needs"
good,"Providing customer service is to have a desire to do so, which is what I have grown to love. Throughout the day you socialize with customers, get to know them while helping solve meager problems to help them through their day."
good,"A regular day is me saying something my custmoer can smile about or cracking a joke. What's crazy is everyday I learn something new, so that saying is true. Management is great and i enjoy all of my bosses, but Im deciding whether if I want to go back to school and choose a different career. Im not so sure about a hard part but Lotto can get confusing sometimes. My most enjoyable is when I see customers kids come to me screaming my name and hug me. That feeling is unforgettable."
good,great atmosphere and loving managers.  Best work enviornments and ecellent co workers

good,I was here a short time due some medical issues I was having. I enjoyed working with the public.
good,clock in unload the truck and then begin to work the products to the aisle
good,Just not enough hours to pay bills. Its a fun environment if you love to work with others and love to interact with customers. Its a very flexible job I would stay but I can't live off of eight hours a week.
good,Publix is a clean friendly place to work. I punch in and I am mainly a cashier. I some times bag and also help out the grocery dept. as a stock clerk. My co-workers is probably the reason I am still workng there. They are friendly and nice to be around.
good,We provide premier customer service to all of our customers for no extra charge.
good,"I enjoyed my work as pharmacy tech at Publix, The pharmacist were good and management at the time was good."
good,Very fun upbeat atmosphere
good,A typical day consists of tendering items and serving a high volume of customers. Occasionally I stock shelves in order to keep the entire store running smoothly. My department duties are just as important as helping another department because we are a team working for a common goal.
good,"Unloaded and stocked freight during busiest hours of day. Never got off on time, some days were 18 hours shifts."
good,very busy that is the way i like to work/management needs a little more compassion/my coworkers are fun to be around/there really isnt anything hard about my job/ the most enjoyable part of my job is my customers.
good,"Publix is very good company to work for. There are career opportunities for anyone who wishes to advance. The culture at Publix is one of hard work, friendliness and customer attentiveness."
good,"The interview process was strange the fact that they didn’t care about anything but my ability to smile a lot. I was lucky to have two good managers but that isn’t always the case i was just at a good location at a good time. The good thing about working here is your associates no matter which Publix I worked or visited they were kind and cool. When I transferred to another location the management was Stand-off ish, quick to point out flaws, and nit picky. Other than that one bad experience there are atleast two good managers out there."
good,"Average to below average pay. Excellent benefits for full-time Associates. Retail job, so very flexible schedule including working weekends. Equal opportunity for advancement"
good,"The management team was really on top of the training, listing to you and your opinion and your advice, personal thoughts.will work and help in any way they could.  Truly the best management team player and caring company that I have ever worked for"

good,It’s a great great place to grow he benefits and other things are amazing about the job to me it’s the best grocery retailers out there snd it’s also a great place for teenagers
good,Publix is a great company to work for. My biggest issue is coworkers who do not do their jobs and complain a lot.  I also feel that there needs to be more co sequences for people who dont do their jib.
good,I would recommend Publix to any one great culture. The pay could be more but the bonuses really helped. I really enjoyed the customer and the fact that I could train in other departments at almost any time
good,It was very fun interresting it was good working there my management was very nice u just got go there an do your job I will not have any problems with anybody
good,Publix is centered around customer service to our customers.  It's a part time position unless you move into the Customer Service counter.  The hours are not enough for me to be able to live on my own.  Other than the hours I enjoy the people.  Love talking with my regular customers.
good,"The company has a lot of opportunity for you to grow. If It's management you seek, they make it easy to obtain. There's also team leader position available to you."
good,Interacting with all walks of life.. The diverse environment encouraged my curiosity about different cultures and environments. Helping the community with my customer service skills and knowledge.
good,Overall I had a pretty good time working at Publix. Benefits and paid vacation if you're full time. Usually decent management aswell. Plus they usually hire good people.
good,"Great place to work, i highly recommend working here especially being a student. They have a a lot of career options, tuition reimbursement options and more."
good,"This job has a customer facing role the majority of the time, so polite, charming associates thrive here. It can be physically demanding at times, but rewarding with the interactions you may have on a daily basis with customers or fellow associates."
good,The best part of my Job at Publix is getting to customers on a personal level. I love interacting  with my regular customers each day. Over the past five years I have met some wonderful people while working for publix.
good,"As I said above, its great place to work, if you are willing to push yourself beyond your own physical limits. Depending on what Department you will be working in, your expected to work within a certain time limit.  Because they do not pay overtime, and if you don't get done on time, you get in trouble."
good,"The work is productive, because you are working in an environment where you are in constant contact with the guest and fulfilling their grocery orders. You meet new people daily, and get to know the ones that come into the supermarket weekly."
good,Loved working for Publix. At the time was the best chain company to work for in retail pharmacy. Would still be there if a local hospital position had not become available.
good,"Publix is my first job and so I have nothing to compare it with, but overall it’s a great place to work. Sometime the manager can be a bit annoying and the same goes for the customers"
good,"I would still be at Publix, had I not gotten a government job. Great pay and benefits, advancement opportunities. They are consistently in the Forbes top 100 companies to work for."
good,Great company to work for especially if you're in school/college.  The company offers great pay and wonderful benefits. The work is pretty easy and for everyone!
good,I love working for publix. I do my job go home and don't get involved in the politics at work. I have a peaceful work life. Decent pay overall am happy.
good,"Overall, this is the best company I've worked for yet. Managers genuinely care about their associates not just professionally but personally. The company is growing in the division i work at. The only downside is pay."
good,It was Great at the time I was there . hospitality environment type schedule. have to be good with handling CASH all the time. Great employment for English speaking personal.
good,Great place to work if you're not in college. Their pay is amazing you can get up to like a 700 dollar check depending on your percentage. You have to move fast also.
good,"It was decent working as a bagger for Publix and I did have decent coworkers, but as an ex-employer for the company, I would not like to review Publix. Thank you."
good,"It is a fast paced job, very organized and clean with very structured procedures in place to be followed exactly. Promotions are usually from within based on merit."
good,First store manager was awesome!!  Once she retired the manager that replaced her showed who her favorites were and made empty promises.  She was very rude and there was no way to approach her with any problem because she wasn't really listening to anything you said anyways.
good,"It was great to work there.  I loved meeting people on daily basis and seeing them again was always fun. Managers kept changing so rare interactions and hard to maintain it. But other than that, friendly people/coworkers and lots of work benefits."
good,"It a great place to work, but I want to try doing something else. I want to learn new skills and meet new people. I want to see what else is out there for me."
good,Great company to work and build at... Just stay safe and come in everyday You will be fine .. great benefits... to help you financially in the future great opportunity
good,"Working at Publix has given me valuable experience that I will continue to keep with me throughout the remainder of my life, the staff is great, and the overall work environment is wonderful."
good,very fast pasting job. but the time will fly by very friendly people to work with.you start by always making sure you have full attention to the customer for a great customer service experience. coming in the door living you're personal life out the door and be the best you could be.
good,"I enjoy going to work every day. I love my work. A typical day is having a lot of costumers to engage with. therefore, you learned how to stay calm when you are under pressure. There's no hard time really because I love the work I do. Moreover the management helps you understand the culture of our company which is costumers come first."
good,"Publix always preached and trained about cost management."
good,"I had to leave because of a family emergency, otherwise I would probably still be there. The managers are respectful of their employees and all corrections are done with good intentions."
good,Leaves a lot to be desired. Offered part time only. Low pay. Management style does not encourage employees. Cannot make a living on salary and hours offered.
good,Publix is a good company to work for. I had a great manager. It felt like family.  It was really stressfull at times. I enjoyed working with my peers.
good,"If you work hard and seek to make this a career, Publix will allow you to advance. This is also a solid job for those looking for their first job."
good,"Overall I think Publix is a great place to work. It is like a family business to me. I have had other family members work there and they have the same great experiences that I have. Unfortunately working hours are not flexible and though they say they will work with you, it is not always that way. It really depends on your manager. I love my assistant manager but I am still getting used to my manager. It takes some time and you’re going to butt heads just like with any job, but I would still recommend it to anyone. Publix just has a great atmosphere and the staff is wonderful pretty much no matter what store you go to."
good,publix is a great place to work and has many great benefits. They help you try to advance into the company if you want to eventually move up with publix. Raises are great
good,"My ex-coworkers we're friendly and supportive, and helped each other out in anyway they could. Most of the management were capable in their abilities to do what needed to be done, but in some cases fell very flat."
good,The only complaint I have is hourly wages are too low but the benefits are wonderful. I enjoy working with people and this job provides this. It is physically demanding as I am on my feet 9 hrs a day. Not unhappy there just need to make more money and I miss working in an office environment.
good,I liked this job a lot. Worked with some nice people. And liked the fact that they would give their employees stock. With the option to purchase it as well. Just didn't like that I was never promoted. Every time a chance would come around for advancement I was passed over. And that alone caused me to not want to remain working there.
good,"Publix is a great place to work if one is able to be promoted, the promotion process isn't always based on merit. The employee culture and customer service is above average. Generally friendly management. Poor wages and very small raises for everyone, under $1.00."
good,I never had a problem that couldn't be rectified by talking to management. I enjoyed working there and Learning the different jobs that needed to be handled to make it all work.
good,"Pay is actually similar to that of Walmart, but way better company. Better benefits and culture and treats you better but still very poor hourly rate. Some stores are lax on OT while others watch employees down to the minute. Depends what store you are at."
good,"Great company to work for, you can go as far as you like with Publix.  Would like to see better work /life balance. The company has good benefits and great people."
good,"Excellent company to work for.  Flexible work life balance. I could work from home 2 days a week..  I think they have to many H1B visa workers.  But, overall a great company to work for."
good,Publix is a great place to work!  Physical issues required that I leave them when I turned 60.  The people are good to work with although very stern and your work is recorded 24/7.  Any coaching needed will be accompanied by watching the video of whatever was not done well.  Reviews and timely and fair and online training is very well done.
good,"The hardest part of the job, is when you have a lot to do and you have that one or two employees who’s sees absolutely nothing to do. "
good,"Depending on where you are working, the environment can be very fun and engaging. There is great potential for growth, depending upon who your management team consists of."
good,This is a good place to work if your area of expertise of grocery store management or customer service. If you haven't went to college and are trying to find your way in life. this is a good place
good,"It is a great company to work for, the hours are nice and the coworkers are friendly. They offer great benefits and give you stock in the company which is nice."
good,Publix Was My First Job In HighSchool I Loved It. The Managers Help Out You Can Talk With Them About Your Hours And Days That You Work. At Publix They Show Really Good  appreciation To There  employees .
good,"Publix is a great place to work, and it provide families a new experience on the work place, also a future for on every positions that they got. I learn a lot since I work there for 8 years."
good,"Publix is most likely the best company around as far as job advancement goes. For example, over time, someone can go from being a mere bagger to being the CEO."
good,Publix is a great company to work for especially for young kids looking for their first job. It's not a stressful job but it teaches you responsibility and helps build character.
good,"great customer service great place to work, but the hour is crazy. the manager worked with you and help you with any way possible. I learned a lot with the company in customer service."
good,"working for publix was a great experience, the culture of publix is friendly and the company provides many ways for growth and advancements. you go to work to do your job and everything goes smoothly."
good,"""If you have time to lean, you have time to clean."" Stay busy! The Deli can get chaotic, but its definitely worth the onslaught of hungry customers at lunch time."
good,Publix is a great place whether it’s a first time job or a career your trying to build in. I would recommend working anywhere’s in the customer service area.
good,"I loved working for publix, until the store I worked at hired more than 50 people to work in the front end. This caused major upset due to the lack of hours some (including me) needed in order to cover the bills."
good,This is a good place to work if you need to get a job quick with little work experience. The work is easy and the Managment is well organized but the job itself is extremely repetitive and boring.
good,"was very upbeat,never had a problem wit pay. wonderful work apprechiation everyone is so very helpful an at peace.enjoyed coworker. every one are motivated for succes."
good,"publix is a good place to work with fast pace enviroment"
good,"Publix is a great place to work and has good pay, I'm trying to get full-time and recognition from a company I can grow in, not looking for management but a good job from a stable company with decent pay."
good,Advancement Opportunities
good,Great place to work for teens. A typical work day can be fast or slow. It. Is a friendly work environment. The managers are always nice and friendly. It is a very clean environment.
good,"Employees there become family, pay is very fair for the workload. Working in the deli is very stressful but the environment and the management makes up for it."
good,great place to work. teaches you the importance of premier customer service and there are lots of opportunities to move up. the management is professional and the work culture is very kind and diverse
good,"I love Publix as a company. They truly care about their customers, the community, the environment and their workers. The culture within each store is different, as the individual store managers and department managers hold different ethical standards, strict to lax. Information is passed down from corporate office easily, but demands are held high and not met due to high production expectations with less help. Callouts are common, as this is a retail setting job.  City stores differ in working hours given to each department from stores in the suburbs.  Hours are based on sales."
good,I believe this is good place for teenagers to start off work it’s not easy but it has good pay for the teen age . i liked my experience there just didn’t like the management
good,"Great place to start out. Many people start working in high school and work their way up to a managerial position. It's also a good stepping stone, just to get experience and the like."
good,"Always on the go.  Multi tasking, hard working, very fast paced at times. Customer service. "
good,"Very great job . I really enjoyed working at Publix , they actually work around your schedule. I also cross trained into the produce department as well which paid more"
good,Publix is a place that is a place that is very cultured and has a great mission with ethics and morals. It was very easy to get adjusted due to the friendly staff. I assisted customers and helped maintain the store. I learned to work well with others and train my customer service skills.
good,"Thoroughly enjoying working with my fellow associates and love Publix's positive culture. Most of the customers are awesome. The few who aren't, though, hooboy. The positive definitely outweighs the negative, though. Even after I return to a full-time job in my profession, I will keep working at Publix. I like it that much!"
good,If you like people and customer service this is a very good place to work at.  I learned alot about the grocery business .Very fast paced enviorment.. Nice people.
good,"I worked in the Deli department, at first I loved it and I loved that I got paid weekly, the management team was very understanding and always willing to help. But, I didn't know that you weren't given the opportunity to start off as full time, and if you worked part time you weren't allowed to work more than 36 hours a week, and for a single mom that is very hard. The hours were not consistent at all, and even if you asked about full time positions, they wouldn't give them to you unless you were a suck up. Another thing that had bothered me that if you were working as fast as you could and the customer complained, you were always the one at fault, there was no back up for the employee."
good,"I love Publix, Great People but the way how everything is run to this higher standard when everyone is crude. Its not right u have managers yelling who shouldn't everyone is just bleh."
good,Working in the deli is a challenging task because of how close you are operating to the customer. This can cause some difficult situations and makes for interesting problem solving activities.
good,"Publix is a great company, I don't have any hate for the corporation at all."
good,"Working at publix was amazing. You meet all kinds of new people from co-workers to the customers fro all over the world. Not only are the people amazing, the hours are flexible, benefits are great and you can also invest in stock. I would definitely recommend Publix to family and friends."
good,Publix deli is a fast paced environment where you are able to learn a lot about different food and nutrition. However the workload can be a bit difficult when everyone is not working together as a team.
good,"While working at Publix i was a produce associate. I learned quickly that in order to climb the corporate ladder you had to do everything you were told, even if you firmly believed you could improve on productivity or efficiency. They frowned open going against the guide book. However the customer service skill I learned while working there as well as the knowledge I gained in produce has proven beneficial to me as my life has gone on."
good,Working for publix was great and wish i didnt have to leave. I had to have majorly surgery or i would have stayed there. I had a great time working there and mad a lot of good friends.
good,"Fast paced environment with friendly employees. Fun and steady work. Baked cookies, bread, cakes and decorated cakes. Took inventory on out of date items."
good,I loved working at publix and would gladly go back. The raise structure alone is better than any other company I have worked for and the managers take the time to get to know you and really treat you like a person instead of a cog in the machine.
good,I did enjoy working at Publix my exiperence was great. I was just dealing with a lot of personal issuse's. Since then I've moved on with my life I am no longer in the West Palm Beach Area. I have been working since I left there .However Publix is a great company to work for I would recommend Publix to anyone.
good,"I enjoy my job at Publix, I have learned a lot with on job training. I have heard the other employees say that it is very overwhelming, and some have left because of it. I don't think it was hard to learn the job."
good,"Great Company to work for. Lots of politics involved though. Advancement is hard within this company. The bonuses are a big plus for this company, but benefits are not available until you have been there for a year."
good,Shifts can vary in time from day to day. Not much flexibility in break time. Great if you like to interact and build rapport with customers. Hours vary week to week.
good,"Maybe it was the store that I was located that caused the headache. The customers make this job the most challenging as a Customer Service Staff. Its one thing to deal with the rude and upsetting customer but when management allows it, it becomes unbareable"
good,"Publix is an excellent company to work for with great benefits, however as a full tine employee you wouldn't have much quality of life. You do get compensated for working certain federal holidays which is nice."
good,"Great company to work for, great benefits and its obvious that they care about their employees. With that being said though, they are extremely strict on things like uniform and overall personal appearance. There loomed a sort of coldness between the employees; everyone got along but nobody really became ""good friends""."
good,"Excellent company, hands on teaching and skills. Day to day basis consists of cashiering, customer service skills, cleaning, and checking on items. The staff are good people."
good,"A typical working day for me is always being on the move.  I get time for breaks, but I'm mostly on my feet doing something to make sure Shopping is a Pleasure for the customers.  Management can be tough to deal with in my department, though.  I think Publix is a great place to work, I just hope I can move positions at some point and make more money."
good,"Not much in way of advancement other than store level. if you want more corporate careers, none are offered in the Atlanta area. The store level is good sometime can be hard to move up. It depends on the manager."
good,"Publix has taught me an abundance of useful information. They have taught me how to cashier, open and close back office, western union, and lotto. I also have learned great communication skills working at the Customer Service counter, I have also learned how run a front end. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I am helping a customer find what they are looking for and see the smile on their face."
good,Great place to work it teaches you a lot about Customer Service. It helps with communication skills and dedication to a company and customers. I love working for Publix and would continue to work part time.
good,fast paced job with flexible hours.  Great for those who only want part time but no real chance to advance to a full time position.  They provide all the necessary training and try to keep the work environment as stress free as possible.
good,"Publix is no question the best place to work if you want an entry level, no experience, no skill job. Starting pay that is well above average and continuous raises make it hard to pass up, along with extra benefits that are offered to every associate at any level. For a lot of people Publix is the best opportunity they can get. The problem comes when you deal with management. I should mention that my experience is solely In the deli. In the corporate level they are constantly creating and changing policies and the standards of production. While they improve the quality of service, they put extraordinary expectations on the workers. Examples include adding items to our selection (usually without the associates knowledge. I almost always learned of new items only when a customer ordered it), and enforcing time consuming precise measurement standards, while not scheduling enough hours to perform basic job duties. On a department level I have seen absurd levels of ignorance and obliviousness. Managers ignoring customers, working people through their lunch break, poor scheduling, and not even being aware of the daily worker schedule (if they remembered to print it out). A huge problem at my store is the lowest common denominator determining work effort. There are certain job tasks that no one has been trained for in a year and a half, despite over half the department having been replaced. Leaving those of us trained to actually do our jobs having a massively disproportionate workload. Certain people are only capable of doing one thing, and aren't expected to do even that. We have"
good,Very energetic and productive environment.  Very demanding and can be stressful at times. There are some good qualities in the benefits. Very strict on attendance.
good,Some days were super busy and some days not.  I learned how to handle disgruntled customers more effectively.  Worked with all ages of people.  I cannot say that there was a hard part to this position and the most enjoyable part was being of assistance to the older people shopping and trying to make their day a little brighter.
good,"Publix is a company where anyone can apply even elder people, students etc.  It has good benefits as well, and It help workers with there careers   An it has a good environment."
good,I see that publix managers for nightahift really need to stand up and operate the the way it is suppose to be operated. The functions and operations arw drastically changing because of leaderahip.
good,"Working here will give you a lot of experience working with people. Customer service is taken above and beyond at Publix. But I do feel as though Publix is to soft with their policies sometimes. And customers do quite often take advantage of that. Over all a good place to work. But of course it does have its draw backs. It is a job after all. If you close you will definitely be working late. And early morning shifts are a pain. But other than that, a pretty good place to work."
good,I had a great experience and I liked the job. With good benefits and good insurance once hired by the company. Unfortunately we had to to Alabama May 2015 due to my husband's job relocation.
good,Publix don't give you 40 hours so they won't have to give you benefits although I think they are a great company that care about there employees. They pay every week. Grea customer service the store always received compliments on the customer service.
good,"I did enjoy working for Publix, the customers was the best part, the benefits, stock, and other accommodations made the job great to where u wanted to come to work everyday"
good,I loved my job and a floral designer. the store employees were like one big family . I very much enjoyed the customers and got to know a lot by first names. the hardest part was working the melon bar also..some days I had no time for floral
good,"The customers at Publix always new me as the nice cashier. Some of them would wait in line just to have me help them, and talk with them. I never really had any big complaints. I even had a customer write a E-mail to corporate tell the C.E.O. that I was doing a fantastic job."
good,I developed great customer service skills and teamwork skills over the years. There is great opportunity for advancement into positions leading into management.
good,"It's a great place to work, but I need a job with higher pay. it's a good environment for someone who needs a part-time and that doesn't need so much money ."
good,great culture which teaches you great customer service skills which you can take with you wherever you decide to work for the rest of your professional career
good,"Bagging, Collecting shopping carts and Cashiering was a typical day at work. Learned to provide premier customer service. Management were always helpful. Hardest part of the job was keeping the carts from rolling down the hill. The most enjoyable part of the job was checking the customers out and being able to assist customers to their car."
good,"A typical day for me would be, I get to work early in the morning like 4 AM  and I would start looking for anything merchandise that my be spoiled or rotten in my department. I always look for those details, because I care for my customers and love them to have a great shopping experience. I would also unload the truck early morning and unload pallets full of merchandise. Organize merchandise and put them on floats and as well as trim lettuces and put cold merchandise in the coolers was an everyday job for me as well as making the department look like a grand opening. Greeting customers as the store opens was another job I was fascinated by. It gave me time to really understands the customer's needs and reason to shop. I would also give them some suggestions in other ways to keep fruit fresh and vegetables as well. Would help customers out as well with other  products they needed help finding. The customers were the reason I had a job and I treated them like family."
good,Friendly environment where shopping is a pleasure. Really dont have much to say but everyone is treated fairly. Hours are minimum depending on who does the schedule for the up coming week.
good,Publix is one of my favorite past jobs. The only problem I had was it was beginning to feel redundant. I would work there again but probably in a different department.
good,"Publix is a great company to work for it you want to be in it for the long run. Also, if you are in school they are very flexible with working around your schedule."
good,"Great place to work as long as your dedicated. Some manager do play favorites but as long as you show up and do what your told, your day will be easy."
good,"Publix was one of the best jobs I have had. The work environment,and the people. All of the benefits, and the fact that you got paid every week. A great job overall"
good,"I was a cashier, handled money. I greeted people when they walked up to my register. I stocked the products. I loved that I had the interaction with people."
good,Publix Pharmacy was a great place to work at as a part-time employee. Publix offered great benefits and tuition reimbursement as well. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a job while being in school.
good,The management and staff were all dedicated to providing the best possible shopping experience for all customers. Highest level of customer service was required at all times.
good,It is a great place to work for. Everyone working there is nice and very friendly. The managers there are very friendly as well and they never hesitate to help.
good,"I worked for Publix grocery store for 2 years,I think I did a great job,I really enjoyed working their it was great learning new things,and the people I work with including the managers were great, but unfortunately I had to leave due to personal reasons."
good,"Great place to work for as a student. growth is available, but you must be full time. great benefits and 401k. working was the same on a day to day basis."
good,Working at Publix Supermarket was a great job as a teen. The co-workers were amazing and it always made for a wonderful work experience. Everyone on the team worked together as one to get the job done.
good,"Work well around a busy schoo schedule. Promote people that shouldn't be promoted though, that don't know how to be in management.  that's the only downfall."
good,"it is a good place to start, however i did not see myself doing this for the rest of my life. The benefits are great, and the management are nice so long as you do as you're supposed to. I had no complaints about this job, I left before they could promote me, so i could follow my dream job."
good,Staying focus on the job and being present to work on time can get u promoted quickly and better opportunity. Alots of benefits and amble opportunity to take part in the perks for working for this company.
good,Stay To yourself at all times Because people don't mean you any good. Make sure that you take ownership in everything. Make sure you play your part and stay focus. Don't put your fully trust into a manager
good,"Although co-workers are the deciding factor of whether or not you're going to have a productive or a rough day, the overall work environment is friendly and inviting."
good,Pulbix is a really nice place to work. They are very good about working with you to make sure your schedule works for you. The working atmosphere is very happy and friendly.
good,Una gran compania con buenos beneficios para los empleados que trabajan en ella
good,The work day was usually long no less than 8 hours. I learned how to deal with customers no matter the circumstance and how to run the front end. I also gained knowledge about money and counting it. The management for the most part is great. Co-workers were easy to get along with most of the time. The hardest part of the job was holiday season was so busy and exhausting. The best part of the job was seeing all of my regular customers during my shifts.
good,I enjoyed working for Publix but I need a full time job instead of part time. They have great benefits. I also enjoyed my coworkers and managers.
good,The experience I had at Publix was great ! I knew it would be because I heard so much about the company but never shopped there. Once I started working there I learned so much about communicating with customers and improving my customer service skills.
good,Management at Publix is great.  Always worked around your schedule especially if you are in school to help you out.  The one thing that I did not appreciate the most was the one day I request off (Sunday) They call me in almost every Sunday.  I got along great with my co-workers and enjoyed every minute working with them .
good,I loved the people I worked with when i worked at Publix. It was a good job and very commutative at that as well. The reason it did not work out was because of my school hours coming in the way but i get out of school on April 21st for my summer break until August and my school schedule in August will be mornings so will have no problem with a job.
good,Usually opened my register and you wait for the customers while standing at the end of your register. Greet people as they walked past you. learned how to level a store to make it ready for the next day. My managers were pretty nice and helpful. My co-workers were nice we got along very well. The hardest part was not getting enough hours during the slow season which is why I left. Interacting with everyone was the most enjoyable part for me.
good,"Always made it easier to keep you update on the latest technology. allowed for on the job training, always have an open door policy."
good,"Good work environment, especially for the younger crowd or retirees. Hours can be rough but otherwise a nice job. Thanks"
good,"Great job, great benefits, salary cap is reason looking for new employment. good atmosphere.Great customers and management is wonderful."
good,Publix is a great company to work for. It all depends on the store you are at and how well management treats you. The hardest part of my job was being overly helpful to the lazy employees.
good,"Publix is a great place to work. Its all about team work everyone helped each other If needed. My co-workers were great to work with that made if fun to work .Smiling and helping customers and providing Customers with outstanding service. While  worked for Publix I learned a lot as in working in a fast paced and busy areas and multitasking, also learning how to do stock shelves, inventory,"
good,"A typical day is very fast pace. Keeping up with the work load, prioritizing, all while waiting on the multitudes is hard for gratifying all at the same time.  The people are my favorite part!  Such a wonderful group of individuals."
good,I enjoyed working for Publix.  It was hard work but I enjoyed working with my co-workers and the benefits there were a lot better than any other place I have worked.
good,I truly enjoyed working at Publix.  I enjoyed meeting and greeting the customers to ensure they had a good shopping experience.  The managers were flexible with my college schedule.
good,"If I were to go in at 5 am I would be setting up the department so that when the store opens up it is up to Publix Standards. I receive the truck in the morning and break it down in the back loading area and then stock the shelves. I run inventory checks periodically through out the day so that our next shipment will have an appropriate amount of stock. Towards the closing half of the day, cleaning and facing product is done to complete the overall appeal Publix is going for."
good,would go in everyday to cashier when I working in deli I would make sandwiches clean the equipment help the customers and stock shelves
good,"I operated the busiest store in South Carolina. I had great co workers and pharmacists. The hardest part of the job was juggling customer service with flu shots, filling prescriptions in a timely manner and counseling new patients. However it was done efficiently every day and excelled everyday."
good,"i worked many hours that paid off every week."
good,the publix culture is a way of life. either its for you or not. there are a lot of great opritunities with this company. where knowing more people gets your further than what you know.
good,"My day was never the same unless I cooked, I came in set up my work station and then went out front and stocked shelves as needed in the deli department and then started cooking and cooked all the way till 30 minutes before I left in which I went and made sure inventory counting was done, side work was finishes and shelves on the floor look good before leaving. The hardest part was making sure to cook my food and make sure the floor stayed clean at the hot bar and salad bar when it got busy on the days I did not have help. My co workers were great and there were always a few bad apples in the bunch who made problems but I learned to just ignore and keep doing what I was doing and pay attention to work not people around me.  I love cooking so that was the most enjoyable part of it and seeing customers faces when they would eat my food and see how happy they were."
good,Worked every day helping customers. Customer service is the number one priority of Publix. Enjoyed helping customers learn about special cuts of meat and how to prepare meals in accordance to what type of meat they were purchasing.
good,"Always fresh, always organized and always friendly and helpful staff attentive to all of your needs. It's up to par with Whole Foods too. Has a great selection of natural, organic, and raw food items. I enjoyed my experience and being apart of such a great company"
good,"Rising up walking into work to clock in the early morning, smelling the aromatic coffee flowing through the air ,emerging with freshly baked pastry's and bread. Keeps me positive and ready to work hard with a positive perky attitude everyday."
good,"Publix is a nice place to work. Everyone is always in a good mood and willing/happy to help anybody who needs it. Great employee benefits and decent pay as well."
good,meeting and greeting customers everyday was inspiring. also working on a team was amazing. i got to meet somebody new everyday along with my regular customers
good,"If you are fulltimer you get very good benefics with the company, the co-workers are nice , the management get super benefics if you want to work as manager in a company you should work for publix they are great with management."
good,"Publix's is a great place to start working if you are young and looking for the opportunity to grow with a company. If you are older, close to 50 or above and looking to grow, this is not the company to accomplished this goal.  You must put in your time to grow, and since the turn over is low, upper levels are long in waiting."
good,"Great job! I love my coworkers, but the quality assurance guidelines are TOUGH! Good company to work for besides that. Its a very diverse setting and I enjoy that the most."
good,While working at publix i learned many different skills like showing premier customer service to customer to stocking shelves and making the shelves look nice. Everyday i go in with a smile knowing that i will help someone who will appreciate it. My managers have always treated me with respect as well and they know what i want from the company. Most of my co-workers are my friends inside and outside of work. I would have to say the hardest part of my job is working the truck while helping out the customers. The best part about the job is the satisfaction i get from helping out others.
good,I have no complaints about working for publix. Except the hours they hire so many part time people that they can not afford to make anyone full time. I could not support myself working here.
good,"A typical work day was checking in and going and getting the carts from the parking lot. After that I would go and bag the groceries for a costumer at a cashier without a bagger, if all the cashiers had one I would ask the cashiers if they had any ""take backs"" (items that a shopper decided they didn't want) and return them to their proper places. If a costumer needed help I would help them any way I could or get them someone that could. The hardest part would be cleaning the bathrooms just because of how gross it was. One of the most enjoyable parts was talking to the costumers and my co-workers."
good,"Provide excellent customer service. "
good,"It was a wonderful place to work, learned to meet and greet the public. Learned a lot about produce.  Advancement was not that hard to accomplish."
good,"Learned about produce and how to cut fruit properly, great place to work, but need full time"
good,hard work and dedication to complete job requirements. use of common sense and critical thinking in situations to keep and maintain a hazard free work enviornment
good,"Almost everyday was the same you came in counted your till and and worked the cash register. I learned so many things how to keep a smile and how to deal with customers and co-workers on a daily basis and leave all my problems at home. The management were great they were very understanding when it came to personal and business life and for that I will always appreciate publix. My "
good,"I was able to work a flexible schedule while I was going to school, the manager I had worked with my schedule for a year and a half. I was also able to get some much needed dental work done because of the dental insurance I had with this company."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Publix, I am currently looking to gain more work experience with better working hours."
good,"•	Provide customer service to over 500 customers daily."
good,"Publix is a great company to work for where shopping is truly a pleasure as well as working. I was only a cashier at the time. There was always room for advancement. After seven years, you are invested with the company. During my time, the management staff wasn't very strong however the store manager was exceptional and looked after the well-being of the staff. I was at a busy store and there was never a dull moment."
good,"I made great money and  had consistent hours. Management always had a open door to any of my problems or concerns. When I was ready to leave for college, they were willing to transfer me to the nearest store to my campus. There is always a way to move up the ladder in this company."
good,worked 3 am til we finished our work load. I stock the shelves and unloaded trucks. Face to face interaction customers day to day.
good,"I loved many things about my life chapter as a Publix employee. I appreciated the warm, open door policy and the friendly spirit of welcome among the employees. There were so many opportunities to learn and grow. Though I began as a bagger and a cashier, I was given the unique privilege of being trained as a cake decorator and I'm so grateful for that opportunity! Though no two human see entirely eye to eye on any topic, there was tolerance and acceptance of many world views there. It thrilled me that people with such difference paradigms were able to work together and learn what they can from another perspective. I challenged me. I discovered a spirit of excellence to be there that exhilarated me. It encouraged me to take it up a notch as soon as I clocked in! Employees were rewarded and acknowledged when they went above and beyond for customers. In was a greenhouse for growth for me."
good,"Publix is a great company to work for as far as benefits are concerned.  Being in the deli is the most demanding position in the company and the pay is hardly commensurate for the level of work.  The only compensation worth working for begins at the level of assistant department manager.  They demand six months of ""time served"" before you are allowed to test for advancement, let alone to be promoted.  This means quite a long wait for even the overly qualified individual."
good,Friendly work place and great worker compensation  plans available for full time employees
good,"Getting up early,"
good,"A typical work day at Publix Supermarket is pretty steady/busy with a lot of different people who come in the store. Over the past 6 years, I've learned how to work with and handle people in a friendly manner and to meet their needs to the best of my ability. My co-workers are awesome. They don't have a problem with lending a helping hand when needed. We definitely work together. The hardest part of the job is nothing really major. Sometimes getting the customers to understand the policy can be a bit difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job is how organized the company is as a whole. There is great structure in the store and as far as the employees are concerned, we are definitely appreciated. Publix is a great place to work!!"
good,"Manager hand a meeting to identify special projects beyond our regular duties. Unloaded truck, verified the load, loaded product on carts to stock shelves. While stocking shelves assisted customers with their needs and advice. The hardest part of this job was the heavy lifting of some products that weighed about 50 pounds. The most enjoyable was to interact with customers and get to know them on a personal level."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the benefits. Also the work enviornment went smoothly because i had great co-workers.
good,I would say nothing but positive things about this company.
good,"Great workplace but very sneaky people. Sometimes you need to know your employees,instead of taken anyone word."
good,"Publix is a great place for teens who are looking for oart time employement. The company has been around for many years and is very reputable, I wouldn't recommend any other employer."
good,"I've worked for Publix for 9 year's this year and never a dull moment. It is a pleasant environment to work in. Publix has an open door policy making it easy to communicate needs and concerns with your manager at any time. The hardest part of the job can be standing on your feet for long periods of time, but with good timely breaks it evens the day out. The most I enjoy about the job is the familarity, customer interaction and assisting and training others."
good,"I setup and clean my register, so it is ready for my customers; I like them to see my station, like if they were visiting my house. The customers come with all kinds of needs and I take care of them following the Publix policies and guidelines of premier customer service that provide every customer with a unique and great shopping experience. I am very careful with the money transactions that I take in care, and be as well as fast as I can. Customer most of the time are very pleasant and I have made a lot of friends. People recognize me here in Oldsmar as the fine lady that work at the Racetrack Publix. The hardest part of the job could be when you have to say no because is something not permitted by a company policy, I always call a manager to see what is their opinion and take the final decision, they always try to please the customer as much they can. The most enjoyable part of my job at Publix is the amount of friends and good people that I have meet at the store, the customers always come back. My co-workers are very nice and we work together for a common purpose, which make things very easy.."
good,i learn that having a communication with the customer is great and making them laugh or smile is even greater because you never know what they are going through.
good,good pay if you don't mind some ups and downs here and their when you come and just be ready to expect the unexpected. management could be better I cant really say stayed in one department my two years but in those years I had 3 cool managers and I say they where cool and I don't come to work to play around or anything. raises yearly good benefits you go get taxed a lot to.one major thing if you cant stay on you feet a long time bending and lifting and their are going to be day where you mind and body going to be saying no but you have to do you job regardless so that being and mind if your not a good stacker warehouse selector position is not for you better get some legos and practice.
good,"Selecting orders to be shipped to stores using Vocalect Pick System, the process of how Publix handles it's shipping & receiving, very few good managers so most were not helpful and very overwhelmed with they're job duties, the physical laborer would be the hardest part of the job, amazing co-workers for the most part, and working with such good co-workers was definitely the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Publix is a great place to work. I know its one of thier employee slogans, but it truly is. Publix offers great programs such as tuition reimbursement, and stock shares."
good,"Always arrived on time,Got the store ready with a manager counted safe made tils all with in a hour before the store opened for buisness i loved the challenge and with out me the store wouldnt be able to open."
good,"i would perform great customer service, learned how talk to different types of peopl, handle money. i enjoyed the people i encountered everyday."
good,"great place to work. friendly coworkers and customers. got to do a lot of different things in there, the bakery, deli, and stocking."
good,"General Customer Services"
good,"It's fast paced, so the day goes by quick. The managers are easy to talk to and really care about you! The co-workers are fun to be around. "
good,Nothing special to write about .. was mostly a good experience
good,the overall job was good but management and job sercurity was not good
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Publix, not only did I enjoy meeting and learning new things from my daily customers and co-workers, but I loved the fact that everyone in the store handled situations very professionally and worked as a team! As for the management, the only downfall was that the managers didnt communicate with eachother very well. Causing alot of bad scheduling and misinformation to be given, causing employees, including myself, to be unhappy. other than that, overall I Lovefd Publix as a company."
good,"publix was the best job i ever had , great pay, great management, great benefits, get the work done in at a good pace and stay safe, the rules stayed the same and they acted like they really cared about u"
good,Stocking and rotating product and helping customers everyday
good,When the line messes up and you have to wait til someone comes and fix it. I learned when working on a line you to be fast you can't move slow or you will get behind. I loved my co-workers we all helped each other out like a team players. The hardest part about the job when the line messed up you will have to work even harder to catch back up. The most enjoyable part was when they told us we have reached our goal for that day.
good,Publix is a great place to interact with customers on a daily basis.Also you learned everyday about new ways to make a customer feel comfortable about their shopping experience.
good,I enjoy working here. I always meet nice and interesting people every time I work. Publix has top notch customer service and we try to set an example so customers will continue to shop with us.
good,play football in high skool and it would help me out with skool
good,Where is a pleasure to work as well as commercials say. I love help and assist customers.
good,Publix by far is one of the best work life jobs I've had. But not a lot of of Job Security.
good,I am looking for a career in banking customer service and teller positions.
good,"Good place to work, good incentives, this was my first job as a teenager and was a positive experience."
good,A great company that persuaded me to believe that hard work and character was more profitable than office propaganda. That was true for that company.
good,"Publix is a good company to work for, especially if you want to become management. Working at Publix gives you many opportunities to learn and grow and the company and it's people have taught me many things."
good,Publix has great job security and very good benefits even for part time associates. Most locations have a family oriented environment and they believe in promoting from within.
good,"Publix is a great company that is all about the customers. They treat the employers fairly. The hardest part of work is the customers giving attitude, but you will be trained how to handle a situation like that. If anything all you have to do is tell your managers."
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at Publix was making customer's happy and having them come back. A typical day at work was coming in greeting customers, smiling at them, bagging their groceries, taking it out to their cars."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at publix, however there were too many management positions in a single store and the multiple sub-managers were feuding for control which led to an extremely disorganized work environment."
good,"Publix is a great work environment.  They love their customers and the employees enjoy their work experience and team members.  This is a great place, especially for those who are looking to begin a career."
good,This a great workplace and company.Great people who lead with kindness. When I need to move to a new store it was very simple or when I need to take a break for my internship.
good,"A workday consists of a steady amount of customers and communication, you always try to be as nice and understanding as possible. you learn how to respond to situations and time management, as well as how to work with a team."
good,"Very Friendly. Hard work long hours but didnt seem too bad because everyone worked as a team and kept up pleasant conversation. Good Managers, cared about safety."
good,Publix is a good place to work at to make money. I had a wonderful experience with the the company for the past four years. It’s just time for me to look somewhere else.
good,Publix is a good place to work if you have the right managers. I just wish their corporate hiring managers were more punctual about looking through applications.
good,"Working at Publix taught me a lot of essential skills that helped me build a good work ethic for example that it is important to be punctual when coming and leaving work, and to keep a clean work place, as well as to work as a team to please and help the customer."
good,Overall a great environment to showcase ones time management skills as well as develop customer service skills to utilize in various areas within the field. Recommend working here if you are looking for a place to grow and develop your skills without pressure or scrutiny.
good,Everyone treated coworkers fairly and was willing to help when needed. I enjoyed our repeat patients and customers as they were very kind and patient.  I would love to work for them again.  I had to relocate without a lot of notice.
good,"I personally had a great experience working at Publix. It was a bright and fast-paced environment that taught me a lot as it was my first job. I would highly recommend being a front service clerk, commonly referred to as a bagger, to any teenager seeking personal income and work experience."
good,I have good days and bad days. Some customers are rude and some are nice just depends on the days. Some days are difficult and some days aren’t. We all have good and bad days.
good,I loved the people I worked with and the environment. At times the managers would take advantage of their power but at the end of the day I was able to excel
good,Assist with ensuring grocery selves ans filled and well organized. Assist customers face to face gives me th e most satisfaction. Great interaction with co-workers because we are a family. Physical labor is a challenge at times but In a good way.
good,I really enjoyed working for Publix. I worked at three different locations and worked there for almost four years. I would go back to working for this amazing company again.
good,The hardest part of my day is standing all day on my feet. I like my manager and my work team as a whole.  I learn new things daily.  My manager is a great supporter of me.
good,"Publix is a great company that cares a lot about how their associates feel. As a manager, they tell you your job is to take care of the associates, and in return, they will take care of the customers. If you do not like to help people, or aren’t very friendly, this is not the company for you. Most cases, you will love your coworkers and customers. I’ve never seen terrible associates make it for yearsss, so if someone is creating a hostile environment, they will not be there for long. Publix has open door policies in place and great HR reps."
good,"Great place to work at. I chose the most difficult department but I love the work and I can do it all with my eyes closed at this point. They’re very flexible with schedules and time off. The Deli is always in need of more associates so there are always hours to go around. When it gets busy, it gets very very busy."
good,"Perfect for high school students or first time job seekers. Also is great if you'd like something part time on the side of a full time job, with very little stress and very flexible with hours."
good,"Publix is the leader in grocery and customer service in the southern US for a reason. Beautiful area to work in, competitive, and room to grow. Management is always hired from the inside out and there is always room to shift positions or be promoted should you pursue that path."
good,A fast paced and physical job that is rewarding if you love customer face to face interaction.  Lots of room for upward mobility if you are focused and driven.
good,"Providing premier customer service , including greeting and responding questions,pleasure work , high standards for products freshness and sanitation ,"
good,"Publix is flexible with scheduling which makes it a good college job.  There are benefits for long term associates.  Getting stock in Publix is nice.  Management is a toss-up.  Some managers are amazing and others are tolerable.  It seems like the rules of the department change from manager to manager.  Good pay for a grocery store job, but after being a reliable, dependable associate for three years (I have always been part time getting about 20-30 hours a week), Publix expects me to bend over backwards for $12 an hour.  It is a good job with its own challenges, but I am ready for a better job."
good,"Publix teaches you patience and makes you humble.  Throughout my years I learned a lot about self reflection and ongoing education.  There is always something new to learn, from all associates, not just management. Retail grocery provides a very fast paced working environment, which helps you with self management and structure.  Success for me was watching associates move up into management.  Associates that I was able to help develop, guide and lead."
good,"Working here was great! I had a problem in the beginning adjusting to the bakery and how fast paced it was, but I met a lot of great people and I made a lot of friends!"
good,"Good work experience, family oriented friendly businnes. Provide a safe environment for employees. Great hours and different shifts to accommodate everyone."
good,"It is a great company to have a job at. The thing is, if your career is of a bagger, baggers barely get days of work. I only get sundays to work. Now I just started vet school and I filled out an application for more days and I still have only sundays to work."
good,"Publix is a great company to work for if you have no further education and need an entry level job. The work day to day is fast paced and a lot to keep up with, but can be rewarding in itself. Be wary about moving into management if you want to try and maintain a home work-life balance."
good,Nice environment with friendly employees. You need to make sure each customer is helped and taken care of with the most experience possible and so they have a return trip. Keeping up with the managers say to you and follow what they want you to do. If you follow their lead then you have nothing else to lose.. Making sure everyone is happy both the customers and employees.
good,The job itself is good they are friendly great benefits if you are fulltime which is hard to get on and if you have anything on your background you can forget about getting a job there
good,Publix is a great company but the hours can be demanding. Never a set schedule week to week  If you have children this might get a little hectic at times.
good,A typical work day for me at Publix is coming in greeting everyone. Preparing myself to except customer and deal with any issues they my have. Perform all my duties to the best of my ability.
good,"Good work  environment, co workers are good management was good the only hard part of the job on the bagger was customers telling you how they ant there  groceries"
good,"The hardest part is having to work standing up without moving for 4-5h straight. I wish the company was like the european ones, where the cashiers are allowed to work sitting down."
good,Working for Publix for 2 years was a great experience. It is a job where you are always moving in the produce department between talking with customers and writings orders and stocking amongst other things.
good,"Helping customers with their groceries, western union, lottery, money orders, returns. Learned how to open/close cash office. Management is very good to communicate with."
good,Good bwnefits if you are full time. The problem is it takes a while to get full time. Health insurance after a year even if yourepart time and dental and vision after 6 months. And you don't have to get the mesical in order to enroll in dental an s vision. 50 cent raises every 6 months. You get free stock after a year of employment even if you're part time.
good,good job to take advantage of if want to increase the way you live and grow financially because it will give you the option to prosper and have different experiences.
good,Great place to work. You got to be available whenever they need you. You work hard and barely call off you will go far in the company. The benefits are great.
good,"Had an overall good experience with Publix. Enjoyed my job as a meat manager. Can be very stressful at times, but rewarding at the same time. Management could have been better but not all stores are the same. I would and have recommended my friends to work with this company. Great stock benefits as well!"
good,Good place to work been there 3 years started my freshman year of high school and still at 1410 off of 98 north pay is good and the people are great there .
good,Nights were very productive and very quick paced and always on a time crunch. Your hours of your shift you worked varied depending on how much there was to do. Sometimes you would get to leave on time and other times you would have to stay after
good,Better than most employers in Florida. Company works to retain/promote good employees. Hours vary weekly which can be difficult but that’s true of all retail jobs.
good,Great environment to work in. Very professional and great customer service experience which was a great learning experience. The most enjoyable part of the job is to help the customers and helping them with anything they may need.
good,If you love people you’ll love working at Publix. Depending on who you’re  store manager is it depends on how much you’ll love it though. Some managers can be very nit picky and that is annoying
good,I would like to work at publix im not experienced but this would be my first job and they do have great communication skills and management. great work.
good,Publix offeres many benefits to those even as part time which I am very greatful to receive. I have close to everything a fulltime person may have as well.
good,"you are treated like real family when joining the publix team, everyone is so friendly and that gives customers the home feeling when they shop at our stores."
good,"Publix is a great company to work for, I have been working at Publix for 3 years I have enjoyed working Publix. The manager’s are nice and the employees are wonderful but I think is time for me find another job and different experience I can’t do the same thing over and over. They say more hours you get, the more money in the Bank ."
good,"providing excellent  customer service ,counting over 80000 thousands dollars  , supervising other employees and assisting if needs be with bagging ,escorting customer to their cars"
good,"Significant focus on customer service provided a great environment, however frequent management changes could change the morale and operation of the store completely, several times per year. It's easy to go from being a rising star to part time associate with a single management change."
good,"Publix is great for all students, of high school  and college.  They work around you schedule.  "
good,"A typical day at my store during the Florida tourist season was busy to extremely busy from the moment you opened your register. Management was considerate of time needed when illness happened. I learned to be quick and efficient and thorough to satisfy many customer personality types and also to maintain composure and a smile for all in most every circumstance whether positive or negative. The most enjoyable part of my job was hearing a customer say, ""you always have a smile when I come in."" The hardest part of the job was having my seasonal time end and then finding another position."
good,Publix is a perfect opportunity especially if you are starting in the workforce. Publix offers opportunity of experience in different departments. Publix is also flexible accommodating and considerate a family's.
good,This position is a great entry level position or good for seniors. It can help with languages skills and give a lot person to person interaction with customers and coworkers.
good,"Publix is a great company to work for, especially as a student because they are very understanding and willing to adjust to your personal schedule. I don't have many complaints about the company as a whole."
good,"The company in general is good, however management treats their associates very poorly. Hours are very inconsistent. Your paycheck can very greatly which sucks if you have bills and want to be self sufficient.  Another issue is  the office politics for a grocery store are a little ridiculous."
good,"Publix is a great company to work for. I would recommend them for a part time job because they are flexible.  If you want to go in to management, you need to be patient because it takes time for that process."
good,Publix is a great place to work the benefits are excellent the pay is great. But the associates and the culture of the associates is not a good fit. I think that should give the managers and little bit more benefit of doubt when it comes to reprimanding or disciplining an associate. All in all it is a great place to work.
good,"Although the company is great, when you have one this large, some leaders are not going to be the best.  Although I love the company, I am not a fan of the role I currently have, and the immense amount of ""out-side of normal working hours"" commitment I have to make to successfully perform my job."
good,As my first job I was able to work and go to school with no issues. Hours varied at slow times of the year. Very busy during holidays. Getting to meet new people and helping people was the best part of the job!
good,"A typical day is very busy, especially on the weekends. I've learned many tips regarding customer service! Overall it is a very easy company to work for with many benefits."
good,Manager molly wells was great customer service manager and provided great work environment was just the right paced at work not to hectic or stressful. Job was extremely easy
good,I enjoyed working at Publix because I was able to interact with many different people and I am a people person. I learned new skills and had fun with the people I worked with. My managers were very supportive and understanding of my duties as a teacher.
good,"I had no idea watching the bakery counter, and cleaning the bakery was so exhausting. I took this job, and i did pretty much the job of 3 people in just 6  hours. I thought they were going to work me to death, and I did actually have a heart attack while on the job one day, but was much my fault."
good,I was there for a sum total of about 2 years. The environment was fast paced. The employees were nice. At time could feel understaffed. Enjoyed my time there. Would go back.
good,I would recommend Publix as a place to at least start at as it will provide the training you need to work at other jobs. It has good benefits and flexible hours.

good,"Great company and culture. Pay is above average, ESOP is exceptional, good benefits, "
good,"A typical day at Publix can be stressful in the deli. Lots of prep work and hungry customers. Its difficult to get pay raises at this job but it is possible. Career advancement is not easy either but with hard work, it can be achieved. Publix has a high standard for quality results and the customer is always. you have to be able to do a lot of multitasking and push sales for that lovely inventory bonus at the end of the year!"
good,A lot of opportunities to move within the company. Many life long employees and the stock ownership program is a great benefit to all employees. A great place to make a career.
good,I have a great time working at Publix... Publix has a track record of making sure that customer care is top priority and that was my focus as well everyday .
good,I enjoyed working at Publix while I was there because it was a high energy environment. Helping the guest to the best of your ability was priority. Cashiering and running the front end was a fun way to interact with many people.
good,I love the people that work there! There is always someone to help me find whatever I am needing at the time. Everything is kept neat and organized and easy to see labels.
good,"Was a great place to work, but did not pay me enough. Took too long to advance me into a higher position. I was more than qualified to be in a higher position, but I was never moved up."
good,"Worked for Publix around 3 years while in school as a stock clerk. Definitely fast paced physical job not for the lazy. Great to make your day go fast but can be very frustrating if you have a lazy team or management. You really only get great benefits if your full time but you get stock after a year in any position. I've worked in 2 stores now and how good the job is depends on your management really. Ive had awesome managers, sexist managers, lazy beyond belief managers.  Job greatly depends on teamwork. Publix Is very big on training and promoting from within so if you wanna stay there can be good opportunities but prepare to work very very hard. Ive seen A lot of very stressed out managers. Publix pushes hard."
good,"I was started at the deli since I got hire 2015. I learned how to make sandwiches, slicing meat and how to deal our costumers. I am not very smiling person , but I have lots of compliments from our customers regarding the way I made their sandwiches, fast worker and has pride of work .And I am proud of me and to  the management that I contributed tremendous services  to our costumers. That's I chose Publix comparing to other job."
good,I can honestly say that my review of my job is great! I enjoy every moment of my job. I love my co workers and enjoy the customers as well. It is definitely a pleasure.
good,"Schedule is very straight forward and there is a lot of paperwork and politics, but overall most people can work around it.............................................."
good,It's a nice place to work but if its really slow your hours will suck if your part-time considering there make sure there full time get their hours i learned that if your part time you can take off as much as you want and i have learned to pick up the slack when others are doing there jobs
good,Great company with excellent stock benefits. Company is customer service oriented and has a well organized concept. Thrives on the ability to serve the customer.
good,Publix is a great place where you can meet new people. The management is terrible especially when it comes to certain departments. One week you are getting as many hours as you have asked and the next thing you know your getting less hours for no reason. The pay i terrible especially if your an employee who has been there and who work almost every single day.
good,Working at Pubix has been very exciting and I have many new people. It is a fun place to work and it keeps you busy most times of the day. They are very family friendly
good,"There is always something to do at Publix, whether you are serving customers, cleaning parts of the store, or stocking shelves, the work never ends.  You get to know a wide variety of people."
good,It’s a fantastic place to work for. The customers and people who work there usually depends on the area. That’s another factor that will make or break how long you can withstand a certain location.
good,Publix is an amazing place to work for but I don’t receive enough pay for as hard of work that I do. The benefits are  spectacular an I would recommend it to anyone I know.
good,Publix is a wonderful place to work they really care about their employees and give plenty of options to move up. Publix is a customer service 1st kind of place. Retail hours.
good,"Place of work for myself was kind of like having a second family."
good,I love the customers. Some days was slow some was busy. I loved Publix because you can work in different departments. You get a raise every 6 months unless you top out.
good,"Publix is a great company to work for and treated me very well. Advancement through the company is very possible if you work hard. They pay you well but they also put a lot of work on you and as a manager regardless if you're short staffed or very busy you have to get the job done. Publix has great benefits and they also give you stock on a regular basis with your pay. Publix gives evaluations twice a year for managers and depending on your performance they give generous raises. Although corporate/upper management is pushing more and more on managers and associates every year and making it more difficult to be able to do your job effectively. Overall it's a good company to work for, but it seems like they're gonna have to change something soon because a lot of the experienced managers are leaving because they are continually pushing that more is done with no additional help."
good,"good long term job. "
good,Its a good job to get experience that you need for other jobs. It can be a career but its a bit time consuming. The hours are flexible so that definitely helps anyone that needs certain hours.
good,"Highly recommend to work for Publix is a great company, great benefits, great everything. Publix has taught me how to be a different person and a better person."

good,"Publix is a great environment that allows for many advancement opportunities. Not only are the employees fun and friendly, but the customers are so regular that they become extended family. No two days are alike, some are extremely busy and other days it could be total opposite, but there is always something to do so your not just standing around."
good,"Publix was an interesting experience for me, the introvert, it forced me to get out of my shell and be more social. Overall it was a fun experience where I learned a lot about the inner workings of a grocery store and why Publix gets such raving reviews from customers. They have excellent stock and 401k options for employees too! Definitely a great place to work if you enjoy day to day customer interaction and genuinely enjoy helping people out in general, whether it's taking groceries out to their car or helping them find a product on the shelf."
good,Publix was like a home away from home. Everyone in the department was very friendly and always willing to lend a helping hand. Never a bad day. Always looked foward to the laughs and jokes that get you thru the day.

good,It is a family environment where everyone worked well together. The cooperation of everyone made the job easy and fun. The hardest part of the job was handling certain customer complaints. Then most enjoyable was the people I worked with.
good,For a retail store you could do a lot worse than Publix.  They really do care about customer service as well as their employees.  They also have a good profit sharing program for employees.
good,Put everything I did into establishing a good Pharmacy work environment. I worked many hours to get the Pharmacy into a well operating entity with turns where they should be in inventory and up to date training of technicians with latest information on HIPPA and other privacy issues.
good,Good company with great benifits very nice work environment stable job crazy hours free lunch everyday most of the management team treats you like family

good,Working with publix has grown my customer service skills and communications tremendously. I was able to adapt in a calm and at my own pace. Very welcoming environment.
good,Great company!  Compared to other stores Publix employees are very professional. We were taught to respect our customers and help to our best of knowledge. I enjoyed working for a professional company like Publix
good,"It was a very stressful environment, I would have to take on multiple tasks without any assistance, and the overtime was rarely compensated for no matter the work put in."
good,The hardest part of my job is feeling that all of your hard work isn't good enough.  The expectations are too high and it causes stress daily.
good,Publix is a great place to work and a great place to advance your career opportunities. The pay is great and the company is fare.  I would definitely recommend this place to work.
good,"I loved working for Publix"
good,"Work is way too easy. I am usually left with nothing to do, because I get everything done in a timely fashion! Have been promised advancement but never came to fruition."

good,i nice enviroment good Pharmacist and hardworker employer that work like a team to ensure patience receive there medicine. Thanks to them Publix is one of the best company to work in the USA.
good,no complaints; work environment was great; wonderful people to work with; schedule was also ok; working different shifts allow me time to do personal errands.
good,"Publix is a great company to work for, they offer great benefits and compensation for your work. The management is always changing due to the high turn over ratio so it's kind of hard to build a one on one with your supervisors"
good,Lots of hours but a great atmosphere and great place to work. Management was fair and just and I learned valuable skills to become better at time management.
good,"It's a great environment and it's easy to move up just do what you need to. Also, always service with a smile and give great quality to your customers."
good,"Needs to be a better balance between home and work life, associates are expected to put Publix first at all times..which is not realistic. Overall great place to work, awesome benefits as well."
good,"I stayed there for 11 years because it was convenient for my lifestyle at the time, but it became painfully boring and I began to feel as if I had root rot."
good,"Publix was a wonderful establishment to work for, great hours and friendly people. My only discrepancy were some of my working conditions, but I was alway in line for advancement in my department it made me feel as tho my work was noticed."
good,"amazingplace to workfast paced wasnt paid bad. nice people. happy easy going. always had time off, didnt care. easy goig people. smile fist, no drug tesr"
good,Its a typical pharmacist day. When I was there is was a great place to work. Lots of autonomy. Now I'm not sure when the business model is so its hard to give an accurate description.
good,"Publix was a good place to work at and had very good people to work with, you really learned a lot more at Publix and you would at any other place. And you would get flexible hours there and always have time to schedule your days that you wanted off and you always got perks of the job and got free food sometimes."
good,I enjoyed my time working at Publix. There were challenges just like with any job but my fellow coworkers and I faced them head in and achieved them. Publix has taught me how to handle stressful situations.
good,I learned great customer service skills in this environment and how to make sales. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with unhappy personalities.
good,"Publix offers an excellent opportunity for anyone seeking to make a career in retail. As with any retail establishment, you have limited options for time off and holidays.  If you are part-time, you can specify a work schedule that fits your needs. Full timers are expected to work when needed."
good,A typical day working for Publix Supermarkets was always fast paced. Usually there was always something to be doing and they always wanted us to keep busy which is a great thing. Learned how to solve problems with product availability in a faced paced environment.
good,Amazing company to work for. Managers seem ti be nore self involved then actually try and help you. Working conditiins are good. Managers seem to choose favorites all the time and that is what hinders you to advance in the conpany
good,Very busy place and room to grow. The day to day tasks are not hard but the scheduling is horrible. But what can i say since it does not change anything.
good,"Great place to work at. The down side is it’s very hard to move up to full time. Other than that, I worked with some very good managers and employees."
good,I love the freshness of the items and the environment it great employees are friendly and each department are friendly and welcoming and willing to help
good,Managers were very strict and other workers were rude. They would work with your schedule and you could easily switch days. They had a lot of benifits
good,"Productive and fun workplace,  much attention to details within the stores, work life balance not good,  expect to work every single weekend here....."
good,Publix is overall a great place to work.  It has a lot of good benefits and you meet a lot of great people.  If you show enough dedication to your job you will advance to a management position.
good,Home life balance is the only thing i do not like about Publix. They are flexible with school but do not give any vacation time for pt. They have benefits but have taken away some really nice ones over the years.
good,get along very well with the employees and customers. they have good benefits they also invest into their employees they make their customers and employees feel at home.
good,The job was relaxed as I had a great time at Publix. It's a great job if you are just starting out for job such as a high school. Great benefits as well.
good,"busy, fast paced, enjoyable, nice co-workers, very flexible hours, company managers are great to work with also, have lots of interesting conversations with customers."
good,I love working there it was a fast paced environment and i love ringing up customers and taking cate of them and they treated you like family i love the deli they subs are good and i love how it was a clean friendly store
good,I loved working at Publix.  I enjoyed the culture and the people I worked with.  The Publix desire to provide premiere customer service was one of the reasons I applied in the first place.  Working in the deli is fast paced and time flies.  I learned something new every day.  I'm a foodie so working and serving food was my delight.  It was very fun.
good,Quickpaced but manageable. Employees and Management easy to get along with. Learned alot everyday. Very rewarding and fun atmospher. Hardest part were dealing with unjust customers. I enjoyed the family orientation of my coworkers and the understanding of emergencies from management.
good,"Publix is a great place to start your Career, made many friends and had lots of fun working with some amazing people. Was a great start up job that I enjoyed doing but ready to move on with other things,"
good,The management have poor communication skills because they deal with too many employees and forget about handful of guys and never take the blame for it
good,"This is all I have to say the people are Great to work for. Enjoy keeping busy, and like working with my co-workers, managers, front end personnel, and in the customer service departments. Plus enjoy doing my grocery shopping at my location."
good,"This was my first job that I started in high school. They were very flexible with my school schedule throughout college. I always looked forward to going to work, the employees are friendly and treated me like family!"
good,A day at Publix is clocking into work and starting on your job immediately. Bagging groceries in a fast pace and satisfying the customers needs by being friendly and taking their groceries to their car.
good,"Treated me like family and, even though it's only part time, they give us good benifets. It's the best place i have worked yet, unfortunately it's just not the kind of career i would want."
good,"Great place to work and fun atmosphere. I've learned a lot at Publix and wished I was given the opportunity to share my skills and training to other associates. From Jun 1984 - Sept 2005, I was in the federal government in Wash., DC. where I retired as a Paralegal Specialist."
good,"It was a great place to work, however, in my role it was a constant battle to just be acceptable. Day to day was the same from my store manager lousy."
good,Publix is a wonderful company to work for if your goal is to reach a management position. Typically you begin working for minimum wage. You receive evaluations every 6 months with a possibility of a raise if you are not maxed out. They work with college students to give them hours that work around their schedule.
good,"The store is one of a kind. We are a Publix that is very busy during the summer. I have learned a lot and how it can learn in everyday life. A typical day is to run groceries to the shelf, help customers, and unload trucks."
good,Working at publix has given me the ability to multitask. Handel money without being nervous. Publix has helped me branch out in who I am as in doing other types of tasks around the store so I have experience in other aspects of publix. All tools I can use in other places
good,"I've worked at Publix for almost four years and I love the company. The people are wonderful and kind, the surroundings are clean and most of the systems are efficient. I've learned a lot of skills working there."
good,Publix is a great first job for anyone wanting to gain experience in the woking field. There are plenty of opportunities to move up the corporate ladder.  Management is great and benefits are wonderful.
good,"A lot of work but nic, teamwork, an excellent manager with very good communication, excellent place of work, learn each of the procedures,work in a team without differences."
good,"Did mostly traditional deli counter work. Took orders for meats and cheeses, sliced, weighed, packaged them for each customer. Fried chicken, worked the Chef's special counter, made hoagie sandwiches to order, worked the hot table--as orders were taken. Took cater orders over the phone to be handled. Hard, hard work. Constantly on my feet, really fun to learn about all the meats, poultry, and cheeses. Boars Head and Publix Brand Great training, super clean stores, lots' of continued training to be up on health and safety standards. Great customer service approach."
good,"maintain fresh case ,ready meals case all other cases frozen .     cut special orders first if needed or during the day. clean up as needed.  make or cut list beef pork or veal, chicken cut or meals"
good,"But..."
good,It's a great place to work. Nice people. Easy to go from starting pay to higher. Flexible. It's hard to get full-time or move up. Never enough people for the work you're doing. Closing is hard.
good,Very diverse place to work. Friendly staff. They value hard work. Management fair. Opportunity to advance. Hardest part of the job is providing speedy checkout service during busy hours. Best part is customer interaction.
good,They have a lot of good benefits you get to work with great customers as well as you have some managers that will help you try to achieve and move up with the company
good,"Publix is a great place to work.  The pay is above average for similar retail venues in its category.  I am a person with mild disabilities, and I find the business associates and leaders to be kind, and patient.  Too, the environment is clean and well organized offering employees a chance to learn the products and where they are located quickly."
good,"A typical day of work at Publix is to first check your schedule and job duties. Second you gather needed materials and begin your tasks-make sandwiches and stock shelves.It may be appropriate from time to time to help a customer when needed. Also, phone calls for ordering must be answered and tended to."
good,Worked frying chicken in the deli. Kept up and refreshed hot case throughout my work day. I was on the north side of Sarasota and cooked HUGE amounts of chicken and wings also prepared roasted chicken.
good,"Time management, fast paced work ethic, customer service, management skills, creative consulting, preparing for retirement, purchasing and selling of stocks"
good,"WORK AT PUBLIX! As a part-time employee you don't earn many benefits, but it's a nice environment. The managers are always great. And they love to promote from within, it just takes awhile."
good,Great place for teenagers to start work. Work hard and you can work your way up to the top. Publix likes to hire from within because you learn the Publix culture and instill it in to new hires.
good,"It is a nice place to work, especially if you desire to go into economics or business, but not for an Animal Biology major like me. I would recommend it as a first time job though."
good,"In my experience with Publix, they have treated me fairly well.A typical days is putting out stock while assistaning cutomers and maintaining a positive facade. I've learned so much from publix, like the imprtance of teamwork and time management skills. There is always a place for you to move up, if you so wish to go that route, such as management positions and other places in other departments. The hardest part of working at Publix is the holidays. Unfortunately the store I work at is not built to handle such big trucks, and we run out of room very quickly. But the most enjoyable part of the day would have to be communicating with the customers, and seeing their smiling faces after helping them find something."
good,Its been a long time since I've worked there and wasn't there long enough to really wright a review. One thing that I do remember is that it was very fast paced and had to earn your pay.
good,They are a very fast paced company and you really have the options to move up in the company very quickly! They know how to pay their employees and how to treat them !
good,"I worked for Publix for 14 years . I started out in the deli learned a great deal there . Moved in to working as stock clerk . Learned ordering product , stocking , hanging sales tags , setting up displays . Learned my way around a computer . "
good,"A great place to work, if its your first job ever. I stated out as a cashier and later transferred to grocery as scan/price coordinator. I was responsible for putting the current ad prices up and doing weekly changing of prices. I also assisted with inventory ever 3 months. However when you are in grocery and they need assistants up front, then you have no choice but to go."
good,"a typical day at work is fun"
good,Lots of people that are very happy and fun to talk to! I Loved Publix because thy were super good at working around your time. They have amazing benefit's!! anyone could work and publix.
good,Publix Supermarkets gives you an opportunity in retail to receive great benefits. You may have to work weekends like anywhere in retail but Publix provides an excellent opportunity to move forward with management opportunities and receive great benefits
good,"When I started I had a great manager who really cared about her employees, and their well-being. She celebrated them when they did good and worked with them when you didn't. This wasn't always the case with some of the later managers after she changed stores, but don't let that discourage you. It's still a great place to work with great benefits, and great people. Plus you meet lots of new and interesting people everyday."
good,"It pays well, even for jobs that traditionally don't pay well (warehouse staff). Managers are great, co-workers are cool. Being a order selector is physically exhausting but your body will get stronger if you stick with it"
good,As a kid coming out of high school its a great place to work. Fun people who provide a family atmosphere. IT all honestly depend on who's your manager and how hard you work.
good,Very good decision to take a manager position. pays very well and also has great benefits and also stock as wel.l I should have never taken my retirement so early. Can retier after 5 years at Publix. young dumb definitely wasn't thinking it through.
good,"Love the people I work with. Love what I do at Publix. Love working with the public. Just time for a change. MY daughters have all worked or work for the same company, so it is a good place to work."
good,Good first time job and very flexible with schedule. I learned how to work better with people and better engage in conversation. friendly environment; I enjoy getting to know the staff and new people.
good,It was always filled with smiles and great customer service. the customer really felt connected with the employees because we treated them with much love.
good,"Although publix is a wonderful place to work, the deli life is not for me. It teaches you a lot about the food nutrition and working as a unit. The steps to prepare food and life shelf days of products to ensure quality."
good,Where working is a pleasure. Very professional and organized. If you want a job that you can work your way up Publix is the right place for you to go.
good,I was employed for over 2 years. I learned a lot. Still employed through June. But decide to leave to focus on non profit work in the supply chain management field.
good,"Great place to work, did good by me in that aspect. However, scheduling in the last 5 yrs has changed to a computerized program making shifts odd hours. Some days you might work 5 hr shift, the next an 11 hr shift. If you are crossed trained, you will bounce around between tasks your whole shift. This is a great way to be exposed to customer service and develop skills for the future. You will get to meet and build relationships with your customers."
good,Publix has high standards compared to other grocery stores when it comes to a clean and friendly work environment and attention to the needs of customers.
good,Publix's top down approach to pharmacy management helps it feel like a supportive work structure even when some decisions may feel like they are not in the best interest of the pharmacy. Seeing decisions through this prism allows for the ground level pharmacies to be more open to their implementation leading to greater success of new programs or changes to operations.
good,it is a fun place to work the hardest part of the job is rude customers the best part was co workers and the managers where easy to get along with not a hard job
good,"this company will not lay you off, you have a firm job with them, but beware the management and the hours they plan on giving you. not enough hours sometimes"
good,"People friendly, family oriented type place. The managers really work with you and help out to the best of they're abilities. Great possibilities of moving up."
good,Productive workplace tedious at times due to the fact that all the employees are not pulling their weight. Publix is a great company to work for but its employees make it a but more challenging than it should be.
good,"Publix was my 1st real job. Throughout my high school years, Publix kept me at their employ. I am greatful for the opportunities they gave me in my early career."
good,"A typical day at work is running a register most of the time. Other jobs would be bringing in carts, changing trash/recyclables, and cleaning floors on closing shifts. The management of stores constantly changes with people being transferred to different stores all the time. The store managers tend to stay at their store for several years. The workplace culture is where associates should and are expected to be relied upon by each other. The culture puts great pride in good service for customers while instilling that certain customers can be dishonest and one must be wary to prevent loss. The hardest part of the job is when the store gets really busy and there is no breathing room between customers and the times when customers go out of their way to be rude through no fault of the employee. The most enjoyable part is the other associates and working alongside them as both co-workers and friends."
good,Publixs is a great place to work for younger people coming out of school and still trying to figure out what you want to do. They are always trying to persuade you to go full time and move up in the company. Overall you make good money and great benefits.

good,Publix can be a very great place to work for. They give out great benefits you get stock and dividend checks. It's a very fast-moving place. Seasons very very busy.
good,"I enjoyed my job and working with customers.. The only thing I disliked about my job is the poor hours i received., My managers always said I was a hard worker and I always received customer compliments."
good,Si es un buen lugar para trabajar pero como todo en la vida nada es perfecto
good,"A typical day at Publix depends on where you work. I've worked for a very busy store and a slower smaller store. Both have their challenges but overall the success of our store really depends on how much responsibility the actual employees take over their store. You don't just work for Publix, you are or can be a literal owner of Publix so it's imperative that you care about what happens to Publix. The culture of each store can be different but there's no denying that people get close here. People that work for Publix also become very familiar with the customers.  The hardest part about working for Publix is really just having to be on your feet all day. As long as everyone is doing their best to do their part then it's usually not too bad. The most enjoyable part about working for Publix is getting to meet incredible customers. When you become familiar with your usual customers you will enjoy serving them more. You get to laugh and chat. You can help them more than they thought you'd care to and that really makes the job much better when you can see their genuine happiness."
good,"As a manager for Publix Supermarkets, my job was to make sure we analyze what we needed first in the meat case so we could cut the right amount of meats and other product to fill the meat cases. Merchandising, ordering and planning to implement the Publix standards. Ensure all associates receive proper training and supervision, ensure correct ordering to maximize sales and "
good,"I love my job, working with the customers in a great environment is a great pleasure but I've been with the pharmacy for 6 years and still not enough prescriptions and items sold to reach the ""magic"" number for a full time technician and I really think is time for me to move on."
good,I enjoy working with the company overall it is a good company to work for and i think that anyone who would join the company would realize and see the same as me
good,"A typical day includes helping customers with their questions and requirements. We work continuously, striving to provide a pleasurable environment for all who work and shop at Publix."
good,I wasn't too fond of this job but it was ok I didn't like the fact their was too many nasty employees and customers management never proceeded to do anything to fix these errors wasn't my favorite job!
good,"greeting customers, scanning groceries, helping customers if needed.  co-workers were easy to get along with.  dealing with a mess up in the system. getting to see certain customers and also learning how everything works"
good,"Publix is a great place to work.  They really stress taking care of the customers and believe in promoting from within the company.  If you are looking for a career in retail, this is the place to be.  You are going to work really hard, all day every day."
good,"A typical work day at Publix Suprmarket  ( N.Lauderdale) was one of the most enjoyable job to walk in to; positive,joyful, respectful work atmosphere."
good,great company to work for.  Outstanding management with company values including training and community involvement.
good,"Publix was a great place to work, they teach you what you need to know to do your job successfully. They are very strict on making sure the dress code is enforced and everybody is clean and decent. Lots of place to grown within the company. A lot of things to learn about the company and the products they sell."
good,"I enjoyed 7 years with Publix not perfect but worth it learned a lot of things and had room for advancement within, met some great people who I also learned some life bettering things Publix mission is to be the premier retailer and it shows maybe one day I'll go back, another plus not saying you can just quit a company and go back but this is on of the companies that will work with those people who need time away for whatever it may be school to better your future, or even time with family and to in general better self thanks Publix for numerous opportunities"
good,Working for Publix is a great experience. Publix is a solid company with a wonderful reputation in the community. Every employee has ownership. Every department works together to enhance the Publix shopping experience for the customers.
good,"Publix is a great company to grown with with many opportunities. many Great Benefits Insurance, 401k, stock ect. lots of training"
good,I enjoyed working with my co-workers and meeting new customer. The job was quite easy and the hours were not long. The company is a very good company to work for.
good,"In a typical day, 11 hours shift with an hour break.  I learned a vast amount the retail business and how to manager effectively. Management is overall very good.  They do a very good job of promoting the right person for the job.  Co-workers vary from location to location, most of them are hard working and friendly.  The hardest part of the job, is the lack of work/life balance.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interacting with the public and making each customer have an enjoy experience."
good,You never run out of work. They have a good team and always keep you in the loop. They give refresher courses to bring you up to date. Easy to transfer from state.
good,Publix gave me a chance to professionally develop and to pursue a retail environment. Pay and benefits are good.  Work days are long and taking breaks and lunch are a little difficult.
good,Working in Publix store 486 was always incredibly satisfying and will always be my go to for shopping as well. They are so friendly and family oriented that i couldnt think of a better place to go for anything they have.
good,"Typical day at work is very busy, no time to get board."
good,Its a great place for a long term career with good advancement opportunities. Great pay and benefits. Occasionally schedules change without warning causing issues with home life.
good,Great job with multiple benefits and promotion chances. Co-workers were likeable. Management (at my location) was average as best. Job responsibilities were do-able and pay is pretty good.
good,"Was able to work for the Company for 3 years and they were amazing.  The entire company has a culture of putting people first (both customer's and employees).  There is an incredible amount of opportunity within the company and they always look to promote within.  The advancement with in the company is not a guarantee, but if you work hard, talk with your managers, and are even open to switching to departments you will always find a way to advance your career.  The only drawback is that it is retail so there will be some crazy hours and there are only 3 holidays where the stores are closed.  The company also has a strong history of being responsible and have never had to go through layoffs so knowing that your job has a high level of security helps to provide that people first culture the company has built."
good,"Publix is a great company to work for. As a student, they are always very supportive and even offer no strings attached tuition reimbursement for qualified degrees. I have not needed to use it for my marketing degree but I know the offer is on the table. Although I love working for them, and working with my fellow coworkers is awesome, I do not plan to stay with the company long since my marketing degree won't do much for them unless I moved to Lakeland. If you are a student looking for part-time jobs, consider publix. They have given me shares of the company!"
good,"I learned working at Publix that it is more about the customer than the store making money that day, a happy customer will always come back. I enjoyed everything about my job, and nothing seemed to be too hard."
good,"I usually get to work for 6 am at which time I punch in, then set up the department end caps. Then I do scheduled and random inventory counts (at least 50 a day) while i grade the deportment for bad product. I then scan out all the shrink that I pulled and then review the next days order all before 7:30. Then I clean the receiving area and work out back stock while waiting for my truck. I have about 6 employees that i must give direction to during the day. I also assist the deportment manager in weekly paperwork. analyzing sales trends and preparing store displays for future weeks sales. I also monitor  employee hours and manage payroll."
good,A typical day at work for me is pretty good. I get a reasonable break in between my day. Ive been give the opportunity to use my Customer Service skills from my perceives job.

There are some days that are stress full when Im not able to do more then I'm allowed to do at work. But when the time is right and I am given the opportunity to do more at work I will take it and run with it. And finally the best part of work is being able to be around people that make you feel like you never felt home.

good,"I started working at publix just bagging groceries and being a cashier.  Not soon after this, management recognized my hard work and offered me a spot stocking shelves.  I worked in almost every department and was transferred to a new store that was opening because of my experience through the years.  They felt a new store opening would give me an opportunity to teach new hires what I had learned.  I worked for publix for 8 years and often regret leaving because I enjoyed working there.

What I have learned from working at Publix is that customer service is very important to ensuring a strong future for a company. The hardest part about working at Publix is that sometimes we come across customer that treat us like we are less than dirt but when that happens what I always remember is that you have no idea what that person is going through. Its important to give every person you come across a warm smile because that smile might be the changing factor in whether or not they continue their day that way. The part I love the best about working at Publix is helping people.

Publix is always  getting new products  and making improvements so as a produce clerk being knowledgeable about these things is a definite plus. It is important that  you and your co workers  work together. The hardest thing about the job is realizing you can't  please everyone because sometimes what they want is not currently available so you make the best of a bad situation by offering other products or finding a store that has it in stock. The best thing is all the good and gracious people you encounter."

My co-workers weren't all bad, however there's always a few I disliked but I worked with them like I did with the people I got along with to make work easy and less hostile. The hardest part of the job was keeping a smile off my face, I am always positive and smiling I never bring home related issues to work.

good,"At this job, you hit the floor running. We generate the most business in the state for this franchise. At a minimum we fill about 200 prescriptions per day, and help an average of 2-5 customers per minute (assuming there are no problems at checkout with their medicine). I had to learn how to do every station, I already had cashier/register experience but the data entry and reading doctor sigs was the most difficult. Reading NDC numbers, being able to intelligently re-select a drug when the stock has run out or order it for another day so it does not clog up our system, how to input and run insurance for drugs and how to use coupons for brand name drugs, what to do when the insurance doesn't go through correctly the first time (which will happen no matter how meticulous you are) were all very new to me but came quickly with practice. The easiest of all was  learning how to counting pills for dispensing. I learn something new everyday and even though it is stressful and I deal with alot of unpleasant customers daily I love my job and the people I work with. If we didn't function as a team every day and know how to come in behind one another and pick up where the other left off without any notice or minimal detail the ""ship"" as we call it would sink. At the end of the day if we have helped as many of our customers as possible then to feel better and live healthier then we have done our job."

Typical day included filling prescriptions, calling doctors for refills, processing prior authorizations, obtaining medication changes to fulfil formulary requirements, interacted with patients, and managed inventory.  I learned to properly interact with customers to build professional relationships to establish a steady business flow.  Management was very decent but a little misleading.  My co-workers at this environment were no problem.  We always performed as a great team. The hardest part of the job was fulfilling promise times and interacting with the customer in a timely manner.  The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing you did a job well done at the end of a long hard day."
good,"Bad part was schedules were often undefined. One thing you know is you have to work, another thing to not know from week to week."
good,Amazing company to work for. I loved going into work every day. The managers were very helpful in teaching employees and demonstrating excellent work ethic.

Management team was great; they always check on us, assist us with production and made sure everything was accordingly to production. The hardest part of the job was leaving work and the most enjoyable part of work was working with my associates."
good,Great company with great management. Great hours and very enjoyable environment .

good,"Os funcionários como eu gostam muito de trabalhar na empresa , mas a administração operacional é muito fraca eles não conseguem manter os funcionários trabalhando por muito tempo porque não dão promoção principalmente para os motoristas e fiscais. Já trocou de chefia umas 3 vezes e até hoje  não acertaram , o primeiro chefe tomava conta sozinho da empresa e dava conta de tudo, mas infelizmente ele foi dispensado e até hoje não conseguiram colocar alguém a altura dele."
good,"Come in to a friendly environment, pick up till greet customers .Co workers were fun and easy to get along with. Working at  Publix taught me how to handle more responsibility when it came to managing a back office and its employees."

good,"Publix is a great place to work for; although, has no health insurance for employees because they only offer part time positions which only offer dental and vision. Publix has an excellent 401k program and stock options for the employees. The hardest part of the job is standing on your feet for eight to twelve hours a day."
good,"balancing the cash office, running the front end and leading a team..the hardest part was making every customer happy. you can try as hard as you want but you cannot make every single person happy."

good,"A typical day is sitting at the register greeting and waiting for customers. I learned how to keep my area organized and clean and how to help customers in a sweet manner. Management likes to have the place look perfect which can take a long time when you have to close the store. Coworkers were all super nice, friendly, funny, and hard working. The hardest part about the job was having to close the store and put everything back where it belongs. The most enjoyable part is getting to be on the register and scan all the products and talk to the customers. "

good,"My typical day at work involves checking the CMM and making sure all PM's have been performed in the appropriate time on the specified equipment. I will then perform a daily walk-through inspection checking the equipment for ant signs of irregular wear, or possible downtime issues. During the course of the whole day, I stay on call for any alarms from the automated system.

good,Publix is an amazing company to work for as long as you do as your supposed to the rest comes easy. It was my first real job and I loved it if I get the chance to go back I will
good,"Publix was always a great choice to make for a pharmacist. I enjoyed my time with the company, however was terminated for working elsewhere on my days off. Second job was not a conflict of interest however Publix just wished it to be so.. and fired me for it anyway. Disappointed with the company demand for loyalty when none was returned to the employees for all of the hard work done. Still the old boys club...women work harder and still do not receive the same compensation as their male counterparts."
good,"I was looking for a part-time job, it's a great place to work.  However I'm maxed out at my current job and have no desire to be a cashier so I'm looking at other opportunities"
good,Great and fun place to work. A real sense of purpose bringing customer satisfaction to the forefront. I feel a real sense of value at the end of my day.

good,Publix is a really great place to work and move up in the company. The pay and hours could be better but If you looking to move up to management Publix is the place to be. There are so many job opportunities there and the work environment is awesome.
good,"Publix is a great environment to work in.  I enjoyed the department, store and people I worked with."
good,"Publix is a great company. If you work there long enough they have great benefits. This was only a temporary job for me, but it was great. I highly recommend to young people who want to work for a company that gives you such an opportunity for advancement."
good,Overall I loved publix. Only thing when it comes down to your kids & publix. They want you to choose work over that. Unfortunately my child is way more important.
good,It has been a fun few years as I worked to get my degree. It helped pay the bills and it matured me. I would highly recommend this job for any college student looking for a job that is flexible with their schedule and pay decently well.
good,"Good place to start your career,  some of the required hours are not good for the work life balance. Overall, great place to work, the pay is good, and if your gonna choose retail as an occupation, the companies that compete with publix don't compare."
good,"My typical day starts with customers and ends with customers. Not only are we taught that the customers are right, we make sure it truly is a pleasure. My number one goal is to make sure they leave happy and want to return!"
good,Publix is a great company to work for with great benefits and plenty of room to advance I would recommend anyone to Publix  we got free hot lunches everyday and two breaks to go with the long shifts And a great atmosphere
good,Working within the customer service field as a cashier gives you the opportunity to deal with multiple people per day.  Sometimes it even allows you the opportunity to pick up on some really interesting conversations and get some really amazing recipes!!
good,"Good place to work for with many benefits and opportunities to advance. They offer for cross-training and tuition reimbursement, as well as working with school schedules."
good,Publix was such a fun place to work. Depending on who your manager was life was great.  We had a lot of fun and had great relationships with the customers.
good,I loved being employed by publix. If I could go back and work there I would. I had the blessing of having amazing department managers as well as store managers.
good,I worked over 15 years for this company. Had the opportunity to work with many amazing individuals along the way. If you have a general willingness to providing a service this job is a great fit for you. It requires lots of time and dedication but it is worth it. Work environment is what you make of it and generally the good days out weighted the bad. The job gives you the opportunity to develop character and values.
good,"Publix always worked with me for the availability I needed, working a full time job and going to school. All they ever wanted to do was to help me but they had needs of their own and I had to stay in the Deli, I couldn't branch out much. I did work meat and seafood from time to time but I wanted to learn more"
good,they asked the good question and they seen if i can get along with other worker and how i do under pressure and can i be to work on time and if they call me in
good,"you can move up in this work place "
good,"Publix is a great place to work.Pay is very good. For the most part I really enjoyed working there. Just be careful with the policies and follow to a tee, no matter what everyone else is doing, or what you see managers do. If you get on the wrong side of a manager they could use it against you!"
good,"My first job, I learned a lot from working here! For the most part, amazing workplace and great raise and promotion opportunity. It all just depends on management and fellow coworkers. There were plenty of moments that were very stressful but you get through it and overall I recommend Publix for anyone."
good,"While working at Publix for 8 years, I was fortunate enough to work in many different departments. I was hired in as a cashier, where I essentially gained my cash handling experience. I enjoyed our busy days; everyone was always smiling and upbeat and you really felt like a team. When I turned 18 I was promoted to Customer Service, where I gained leadership experience. I created schedules, helped customers with issues, answered calls and at the end of the day I balanced the cash vault. When other departments were short, I would step in and help wherever I could."
good,"There are many opportunities to excel within Publix, but personally it just isn’t what I’m looking for in a job because my availability is not enough to make a consistent pay check. I have a family to take care of and just can’t comply to the hours they have to offer."
good,Publix is a great place to work. It is very easy to start at the bottom and work yourself up. Good pay and good benefits. Co workers are like a family to me.
good,Was always busy and was fun to work at always had help when needed and never felt over run with work. They always worked with my schedule while I was at school
good,"Great place to work!! Highly recommended great for advancement into management. Cashier, bagger, front service clerk, bakery, deli, produce, florist, cut fruit, meat cutter, seafood, grocery, team leader, diary"
good,Publix was a great first job for me I loved working there but in life you have to move on in life and move onto better things that’s why I’m looking to find a new job
good,"This can be an incredible place to work for a very long time, the problem is not everyone has the time or resources to work forever to get anywhere. The company itself is Amazing"
good,"Working at Publix has taught me how to provide premier customer service, while learning to be further successful in my position. Management was excellent, and I was given much support when needed. Typical work days are usually busy, and the most enjoyable part of the job, was being able to satisfy customer needs."
good,I was a bagger that got promoted to a cashier and loved it! I loved helping and talking to my Customers. Your co workers are your Publix family. If the customer ask where something is I would turn of my light and bring the customer to the product. I was fast and I always looked at what to grab so I was bagging as I was scanning the products.
good,Publix is a great company to work for. I highly recommend it to those who aren’t afraid of customer facing roles. The stock benefits and tuition reimbursement is a huge plus!
good,great company great benefits and great opportunities for growth very intense and demanding at my position as a selector but great opportunity to learn new skills to help me further my career with publix
good,"Publix is a welcoming company to work for that takes the time to explain the roots of the company, what to expect and and why it’s a great choice to work for."
good,I loved working the rotating schedule and they payed good and unfortunately I blew it and got too many levels and maybe one day they will take me back
good,Honestly love it here. My customer service team is amazing. Just like with any job it can be a bit stressful and has its flaws but there’s plenty of opportunities for advancement. And great benefits. Keep up the work and you’ll get more hours
good,Publix offers employees the opportunity to grow organically within the company and will only add people to management who have been with Publix. Publix hammers home the concept of premiere customer service.
good,"It was a great job but every employee was fighting for a full time position, 300 employees to a store and only about 20 storewide full time slots. Other than that it was nice"
good,"Great company I went from selector to truck driver.... pay is good but you have got to invest your self. If you do that they will invest in you. They pay great!! I worked in the Dacula D.c. worked there 6 years but had to move to south Florida for family, wished they could have helped with a job transfer but the thing bout Publix is the rules are the rules no matter what."
good,Over all publix is a grate place to work  i love my job at publix  and i live about 5 mint away if i had a chance i would go back to work there i love publix
good,A wonderful place to work providing premiere customer service to everyone in the store. Showing the management you care about the customers will give you a leg up when going full time or advancement. $.25 cent pay raises every 6 months. A really good place to work if you love retail.
good,Publix has allowed me to work in different stores when help is needed or when there is a lack of hours available in my home store. Being that there are several other pharmacy technicians working in our store not all stores have that luxury so I'm grateful to be able to provide assistance when needed
good,"Publix seeks to please their customers and they are a fun loving productive place to work."
good,"I have worked at Publix part-time and full-time. Slow work is not rewarded. Accurate is rewarded and job advancement is transparent. In the Grocery dept, there is always something to be done."
good,"I started Publix when I was 19 years old started as a cashier, I worked in all departments except the bakery.  Mostly I worked in the Customer service desk or deli"
good,"Working in customer service helped develop my social skills as well as patience. The bakery is an easier, but more laborious job. There is less customer inteaction, but still requires professionalism."
good,Enjoyed working at publix for the 10 years I worked there. Would have liked to have weekends off but had to work at least one day of weekend. Moved to fort meade looking for other employment to be able to spend more time with significant other.
good,I enjoy working at Publix. Benefits are excellent and environment as well. Management staff is great. Cleanliness of store is great as well. I’ve been an employee for almost 3 years.
good,Great company to work for depending on the upper management team. With hard work dedication and willingness to do things without being told you will be promoted quickly
good,Working at Publix was a pleasure. Coworkers were very friendly and pay was good for my very first job. Starting off was tricky but you slowly get used to the work environment and it is a great place to gain job experience whether you want to stay or further advance in other fields.
good,un dia muy agitado atender rapido a los clientes ser amable y cortes lo mas dificil es complacer a todas los clientes y se tiene q dejar todo muy limpio y rapido lo mas agradable es que pagan bien
good,"I've worked at five stores, only one where I was unhappy. There are a lot of opportunities why plants note if you want it and for the right person but they're also good part-time opportunities that allow you let stability for school and life"
good,"Publix was great. The co workers were great and fun to work with as well. The conditions were solid and clean almost always. You never knew what to expect in a day's work. Some days might be very busy, other days may be very slow. Sometimes the day will switch between slow and fast and vice versa, keeping you on your toes. Management was great, not being too harsh for simple, everyday mistakes. The hardest part of the job was handling mean, or rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was making relationships with coworkers and customers."
good,Loved my cashier's job.  I was only there for six(6) months due to a family crisis.  I had to leave abruptly; which was not a way I do things!  Great company!
good,Very flexible company great for students to work. The store is always clean. Management and staff are very supportive and there is always room for advancement. Nothings beat the BOGO
good,Publix provided me with a second family and stable growth from the time I was a teenager. It is a face paced environment that requires a lot of dedication but allows you to become very successful. They provide all training you would need to advance and promote from within the company.
good,"Publix is a great place to work if you understand that the customers are the #1 priority. In addition, there are immediate opportunities for advancement within the company if desired."
good,"Working at Publix allowed me the opportunity to see from inside the way a grocery store should be run. The company and its employees really do strive for excellence in customer and employee concerns. I always felt heard and was met with understanding an empathy with any concerns I had. The employee selection process, it seemed to me, is more refined than at other grocery stores, but if you prove yourself as an employee, it is seen and rewarded, and upward mobility is very achievable."
good,"Long review coming here... Publix overall is a fantastic place to work. Great for students, great for people supporting families, given that you are in the process of trying to advance in the company. Base level associates don't make enough to support a family, but that's not an egregious oversight for the company, simply the way any company works. If you intend to make Publix your career, put in the effort to do so, and can manage with the starting pay for a little while, you will soon find yourself in a better position (bi-annual review periods means potential for a raise twice a year, anywhere from .25 to 1.00 depending on your performance). Once getting full-time you are usually in a good place as far as pay is concerned. Advancement is based almost entirely on merit and work performance. But there are some who get through quicker (for better or worse) if you fill a void in the diversity of management. There is a push from corporate management to seek up and coming diverse individuals to promote to management positions. If you have the work ethic and fill this void, you will advance quickly. I don't see a problem with this, unless they begin to advance solely on this to make themselves look better to the public (not currently the case in my opinion, the advancements are generally deserved). There are a few complaints I've read on here regarding cliques and nepotism and favoritism, however at the store level, this is not really a broad issue. That may have to do with a certain management group at a certain store, but is not a problem in the vast majority of stores. I've found"
good,"BOY! Did I miss out on a possible gold mine?! This one guy I know that kept with publix has been keeping in touch for the past ~13 years is now rich just because of the stocks they set their employees up with, That could've been me too if I had only known."
good,"Great place to work, gives you the opportunity to advance, I loved the fact that advancing was all based on work performance and not seniority. Great benefits."
good,"In a day, we wait on customers and provide premier customer service to them. We have many repeat customers whom you develop a friendliness with. We take care of the customer always!"
good,"I never considered full-time employment while in school, but an Scan/Price clerk is a perfect position for me with my organizational skills. This company is a great first job for any high school student and the opportunities, if you are looking for a career in retail, are limitless. I plan to stay with Publix one day per month until October 2019 to become vested in my benefits with them, but I am interested in positions in the field of my study."
good,"The retail side of Publix is not the greatest. However, working at their corporate office is pretty chill. There are a lot of great people that work for this company."
good,"I love all my coworkers and the managers are great. It's very team based and it's important to hve good customer service skills. The atmosphere is wonderful but can be stressful at time. If you're willing to work hard as part of a team, this is for you!"
good,Great company and a great place to work especially for young career minded workers looking for a profitable long term employment. Older workers looking for part time are also attracted to this company.
good,Every day was a full fun day. I worked in the bakery and there was always something to do and never get bored. I’d have to say decorating was one of my favorite things to learn.
good,Happy to be working for publix . working at publix you get the chance to excell . Great customer service . Excellent management team. Workers are able to voice their opinion withoyt being judged. Clean environment.
good,"A typical day at work is basically a slow day but you still get done, what I learned the most is if you work hard you will get where you want to be, the management is alright but in all they’re kind, the workplace culture is amazing, the hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers, the most enjoyable day is getting off of work"
good,"Great company to work for, good benefits for yourself or for your family, flexible hours to work and great work environment to gain retail work experience."
good,Some good people but the other u know who there are in a bunch are in a good bunch.But for the most part there or some very very nice people the will make you feel like home.
good,"Publix is a wonderful place to work at, especially for high school students such as myself. Publix was very flexible with my schedule allowing me to work my hours around sports, school, and dual enrollment."
good,Began with a morning stretch to work safe throughout the day.then we would go into our morning meeting which will we then assigned our job for the day
good,A typical day of work at Publix consisted of me coming in checking my duties for the day. I learned that some days are easy and some days will be long and stressful as long as you are people person its easy. Management was good but no one ain't perfect. The workplace culture for Publix is unbelievable you would have to experience for yourself. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting the customers on a daily basis.
good,"From the little bit of time I had worked her was a blast wish I never had to leave,but due to family issues and problems in life didn't sit well with my work schedule"
good,"Very good company to work for. Nice friendly environment free lunch"
good,Publix is a hardworking company that is growing.  They are expanding to many states in the Southeast. The work schedule can be all different hours.  You will most likely start part time and the company promotes within.
good,Consistent goals and procedures make maintaining company standards easy.  Highly developed work place culture makes working in retail enjoyable even for 20 plus year associates working besides 15 year old first job associates.
good,Great place to work but high expectations from upper management and salaried managers.  Work was labor intensive depending on position.  Culture was changing for more labor first and family second as time went on.
good,"Oustanding work environment, always a joy helping customers and making sure the store is nice and clean. Making the customers smile and making sure their day is even better than when they walked in."
good,"I enjoyed my time there, regret that I had to move. I liked that I had freedom in my department to implement my own strategies to help complete tasks at hand. I also liked the people I worked with."
good,I really enjoy working at Publix. The staff are always friendly and help each other out when needed. I work at my own pace most days as the floral clerk.
good,Very organized place of work. I enjoy working here compared to other retail places. I like the fact that I get to choose what department I can work in.
good,It’s a great job for people without bills. I am currently living on my own and working there and it’s very hard to make it by every month. Great benefits and great managers but extremely stressful when there and come pay day.
good,Publix pharmacy is a traditional retail pharmacy where you can expect to be helped with the highest professional excellence. Publix takes care of their employees and customers
good,"You come in clock in go down stairs. You set up your register and begin scanning.You greet the customer, ask how the customer shopping experience , than you thank the customer, and welcome them back. You continue doing this for Four hours, until break. I learned how to offer premier customer service, be responsible, have respect, and be able to rely and connect with associates. The managers are fun, but that is when you are off the clock. On the other hand, they are strict, outgoing, hardworking and, understanding. The hardest part of the job is remembering all the codes for the fruit, and vegetable items. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know, and able to see different varieties of customers each and everyday."
good,"Publix is a good company..  I applied for full time, but after I was hired, stated only part time, have to be there about 6 months to a yrs to get full time...."
good,"I think that Publix is a good company to work for.  You are always busy there, and you get good benefits.  You can learn teamwork, customer service, and efficiency.  A friendly attitude can also be developed here.  However, sometimes, it can feel very routine to me while working at Publix."
good,I was a cashier and bagger. I got to interact with customers all the time. You tend to know your daily customers and become close with them. Management is better than a lot of fast food places and you learn a lot of things you can use in other work fields.
good,"Publix was a great place to work for 10+ years.  The most enjoyable aspects of the job had to do with the customers, co-workers and learning new things.  I enjoyed my time there and it worked well with my schedule, family responsibilities and everyday life!"
good,A typical day at work is coming straight in to help customer's. Do a walk through of my case and check my vaule add (gourmet section) to see what items are on sale and need to be replaced for the remainder of the business day. Its pretty straight forward. Presence and attentiveness is 100% non negotiable.
good,"The hardest part of your job is the Customers."
good,"Publix is a great place to work with great employees and customers, however I do not receive enough hours to pay for my expenses. Other than the issue with hours, Publix is definitely a great place."
good,Very demanding job that requires constant and repetitive attention of a vast number of employees and customers. Great culture that is perpetuated by from the top.
good,"There is always something you can do, there is never a dull moment. I firmly believe working with this company has helped further my social skills when it comes to strangers. It has become easier to speak and help people over time."
good,"We are always working to meet the customers' needs, and exceptions. Having for work for the company for years, you learn how to build relationships. The culture of Publix is always giving back to their community."
good,ware house work  stacking wrapping pallets shipping and receiving  delivering cleaning unloading and loading trucks  fork lifts inventory and counts ..
good,I have worked for many companies and have done many trades. This is an incredible company to work for if you are dedicated. The work environment and morale cant be matched. Benefits and oppurtunities are amazing. However there are different strokes for different folks.
good,"Enjoy working with people and a great place to work"
good,Good place to work co workers were really nice and so were some of the staff ..but the policy if you miss a certain amount of days your gone from there. .that's why im not there anymore because I had a old dog that had a heart mumar and the medicines didnt help none and she is passed away now 😢  so i missed a bunch of days because of that and it was excusable as a family illness  so im no longer there... My manager said it wasn't up to him it was the corporate office .so in no. Longer there was with Publix almost 4 years and i loved my job and I miss it now ...I can reapply after 1 year from the day I got let go August 23 this year....I hope I get my job back at publix...my manager did say I did a great job and that he was going to miss me and so did other co workers 😊
good,"Publix is a great place to work for with some of the best employee benefits possible, like health insurance, 401k, a strong stock market, a good chance to get a raise and move up on the employee ladder if you actually work or try for a management position."
good,"The company offers a lot to their employees.  Unlike many other employees.  They offer paid vacation, quarterly bonuses to all employees.  You are working inside a cool place not outside in the hot heat"
good,Great work environment. No complaints. Everyone is happy and joyous that there there. Very hard work but you enjoy the money you make and sometimes it does take hard efforts to make money.
good,"If your in college or in High School it a great job! Flexible hours, solid career, many benefits you can take advantage of also it is a great environment to be in"
good,"Good company to work for, flexibility with hours, Managers are decent, great way to work on people skills and communication, raises are okay but not the best"
good,Publix was a great place to work. It was fun and the managers were friendly and caring. There were stressful days but we always got through them together. I recommend this place to anyone.
good,"I really enjoyed working there! The best part of the job was forming relationships with regular customers. The most challenging part was bagging and going in and out in all kinds of weather. The management was great. There were opportunities for generous raises, but little opportunity for advancement."
good,If you want something challenging and self/work maintained publix is a place for you. The company offers so many benefits including the 201k and in about 10 years you can retire with half of a million dollars
good,"Publix is a very fun, family like business and everyone is happy and ready to work. The customer service is unbeatable compared to other places. The easiest but most difficult part is handling customers, it easy to provide good quality customer service but it is kind of hard if we do not have the products they want or can not provide them with the service they expected."
good,"I liked to work at public because of how flexible my schedule was, I had to time go to school and do homework but at the same time I was able to make save money."
good,Publix is a great company to work for with amazing benefits.  Everyone was very helpful and worked as a team to deliver excellent customer service. I loved working for the company.

good,"Nice place to work, friendly environment. It’s nice to actually to get a raise every 6 months faithfully due to meeting your expectations on your evaluation."
good,"fast paced job, great benefits, is was a very family oriented not anymore. sometimes not enough people I had to worked double shifts. no appreciation. lots of production with high goals"
good,"Liked it a lot, didn't love it! Couldn't get benefits for the first year, couldn't get more than 30 hours a week, couldn't get a raise... but I liked everyone I worked with and for."
good,I learned how to approach customers and make them feel welcome to ask me about items in the store.  How to properly bag groceries and stock shelves.  Its not always easy with customers but there is always help.  Time flies by when its busy
good,I loved my time at Publix. It didn't fit my family dynamic as far as hours and schedule. I wouldn't be opposed to working there part time. I still own stock in Publix.
good,Publix is an employee owned company which make it such a great place to work. They give you stock shares after a certain amount of time/hours. once you have your shares you start to receive dividend checks. Great way to plan for the future.
good,All was well. I liked the area I worked at because I was able to get out of my box being my first time as a cashier. I was able to use my charm and kindness to the customers.
good,"I have worked for Publix twice, and both time I’ve enjoyed my experience and am very grateful for having been part of the Publix Family. You immediately receive stock one joining and after probation you’re eligible to begin your 401k and medical benefits."
good,great place to work. I had a pretty good experience working at Publix. Most of the staff managers are fair with employees. I would highly recommend someone works at Publix. Great benefits!
good,Everyday was a productive and busy day. Us as an employees had the ability to talk and enjoy conversation with customers it was very fast paced work atmosphere.
good,"To help the pharmacist to fill the perceptions, data entry, product dispensing, answering the phone, customer service ,  supply order and ordering  over the counter medication"
good,"Publix is a great place to work.  I wish I would had applied earlier in my career.  Typical day at work in Produce Department is setting up the Wet wall, unloading the truck, down stacking the truck unto carts by sections and categories, customer service, and stock fruits and vegetables.  Also, cutting fruit and making salads."
good,"Great work environment that offered the opportunity for advancement.  Company took a sincere approach to each employees well being, and helped individuals get to the next level if interested."
good,"I worked for Publix for 5 years and loved it. The management treats you right. You get quoterley bounses, $1 hour extra on Sunday, plus stock in the company."
good,"I have been at the same store for three years and have seen many employees and managers come and go. What I have learned most is that a great manager is everything. Though I have lost some of my favorite coworkers over the years, I still enjoy my job and the work I do. "
good,The Port Wentworth store is a fun and quick-paced store. It is very hands-on and the managers are very understanding and will put associates in the right spots to succeed. They will help associates prepare for promotions and other departments. It is very much like a second family to me.
good,Publix is a very well rounded job it takes care of there employees no matter what my job considered of being on your toes all the time and not to think
good,"The hardest part of the job was getting my fellow associates to keep up with the production plan. As well as getting the management to allow me to train in another aspect of my same department."
good,Job security and had a great team to work with
good,"Publix was my first job and it started out rough for me because being able to bag groceries fast without smashing or breaking anything just comes with time and a few unfortunate mistakes. However once I'd gotten into the ebb and flow of the work and what was expected of me I never once dreaded going into work, at least for the store that I was at. Friends with everyone, knew them all on a first name basis even my bosses. Plenty of opportunity to grow and become recognized if you're willing to work hard and earn what you want at this company. I became full-time in a year when some people there hadn't gotten it in three+ years. I worked some crazy shifts and came in if they called me and was recognized for it. Overall good starting job for those looking to get their foot in a door and a solid name on their resume for future applications."
good,Working at Publix was like having a fmaily. People had close yet professional relationships that would be hard to find anywhere else. Management took care of us like we were their own.
good,"I love working for Publix, but my requests to move up were being ingnored by the manager at that time. She has since been demoted. I'd love to try them again. Great company."
good,"AS for me I loved my job not sure if it's safe to say I loved it too much. I've learned rotation fifo, very knowledgeable of the product I was dealing with. Management could use a boost with associate relations and customers as well being more genuine. The hardest part of the job was dealing with call outs and others lacking in their duties. also special treatments. Most enjoyable part was satisfied loyal customers that asked for me by name, the benefits, and the pay"
good,"The pay is above minimum wage for beginner positions and they provide raises and reviews every six months. Great job to start or to retire from, they offer so many benefits and opportunities to move up. People are friendly and management supports their workers."
good,"My career at Publix was at my prime and peak of my life. The culture was there the pay was awesome. Lot of different things going on in the community, close co workers the whole sha bang! Only thing is the management started shifting and things started changing once different rules started to come into play it stop feeling like a career."
good,if you can get full time and don't have/want a family its perfect. the hours are crazy and shifts usually are not set so you may open one day and close the next
good,"I think Publix is a great company to work for. I was treated with respect and compensated well for my hard work. The job can be very demanding at times, but can also be very rewarding. I learned a lot from my experience there and look forward to using the skills I’ve learned in future careers."
good,I loved working there had to leave for personal reasons understand family work life balance. Great managers awesome team of people to work with would go back
good,"I started off as a part time cashier and was able to work my way to management in three years. I developed skills in order to advance and most importantly supervise and train 50+ associates, and do my job effectively, and professionally."
good,Yeah working hear was fun I think I enjoyed the job that I had to do. I don't really have much else to write about it the customers that come in are pretty cool
good,"Although retail hours take some getting used to, that is the nature of the business that one accepts when working retail.  Hours can change as needed.  That said, Publix is an excellent place to work."
good,"Good place to work. Great benefits and stock options, areas of advancements. Associates are willing to complete the task given them to, and they enjoyed being challenge."
good,"* Greet and assist customers"
good,"fun place to work, flexible with hours. very understanding. Publix is a place that doesn't pay as much for work performed but overall the stock is worth it, and time flies working there. you do have to reach a certain amount of hours a year in order to be eligible but its all worth it in the long run."
good,"The job was kind of demanding on things but it was fun. Kind of sucked that I had to stand in one spot for hours. Killed my legs, feet, and back a bit but it was still enjoyable"
good,"Publix is a great place to work for career-minded individuals who have a good work ethic. Come to work on time, do your job with a smile and become knowledgeable with the products Publix offers and you will find a career there."
good,I loved working at Publix. I loved managing and being responsible for multiple employees. Publix pay and benefits are good. Too many work hours for managers.
good,"The family atmosphere and company culture is above all others! Excellent benifits, pay, and bonus's. If you have a friendly demeanor, can give your all to the company then you can go far!"
good,Working at Publix starts with a smile and a motivation to serve customers with excellence. The management is always there to build up their employees and provide the help and guidance needed.
good,Publix is a great company and has a wonderful compensation package. But is only for those that are willing to put in the work. There is a lot of competition to reach the next level and only the best of the ebst are able to be recognized.
good,Love the job it's a learning experience and fun if you love dealing with the public and it's a different experience everyday hust focus on your job and your good
good,It was nice to get a higher pay than my first job but ever since the first two weeks my hours continue to decrease each week and I'm only getting 5 hours a week now.
good,An average day at work includes cleaning the store during the day and also at night we get a wide range of cultures that come in everyday the employees are always fun to be around and joke with
good,"very active day"
good,Very flexible with associate schedules.  Work is mundane with little challenge but the environment is friendly.  If you like knowing what you're going into every day and shooting the breeze with customers its perfect for you.  Environment is very relaxed and friendly.
good,"Typical day consists of Clocking in and beginning your role in the Publix Grocery Store. I've learned the Behind-The-Scenes in a corporate grocery business. Management for the most part was great, friendly, and fair. Hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers, The most enjoyable by far, is coming across the most extraordinary people. Making the workplace just as enjoyable."
good,"Publix Warehouse is a place of business no time for play."
good,"Publix is a world of it's own! It's all about customer service and treating employees and coworkers with respect and decency. When you treat your customers right, they treat you right so it's very rare you have rude, nasty customers!! If you work hard enough and go full time, or work at least 1,500+ hours a year, even part time employees can receive health coverage. The 401k and company match program with ESOP is fantastic. Definitely perfect for a high schooler to start out with, keep part time in college etc, grow with the company and start saving young!! You can always transfer the 401k later if you don't plan on staying with Publix, working towards becoming a store manager making well over 100,000/year!!"
good,"I enjoyed working with the people there, however the job itself was stressful and the amount of time that it takes to get anywhere in the company precedes any judgement of a career there."
good,Everything is prepared for the week. I learned how to keep things organized and managed to keep damage items decreased. They always allowed us to take holidays off.
good,"Great place, great culture, great company. If you can get your foot in the door at Publix do your best to stay. It has been a fortune 500 'Best Company to work' since they started the list."
good,Publix provided their employers a opportunity to continue to grow and advance within the company. Publix gave me my first start to an open mind at my capabilities that I withheld within.
good,"Publix is a great place to work  I was in the management program. "
good,Publix is a good place to work its just that when I started school and picked up a new school schedule they did not want to work with me. I was willing to work still trying to get my degree in College
good,"Publix is a was a great place to work, fair, willing to work with your schedule if needed. I loved working at the Ocoee, Florida store, management was super awesome. I do not know how  Publix stores operate in other states, it seems very hard in South Carolina to get hired on at Publix, I would recommend working for the company, really is a great place to work"
good,loved working there just wanted a Monday thru Friday job. employee was great to work for. love the customers just wanted more. no weekends to spend time with family
good,"Typical days at the pharmacy include: process and filling prescriptions, troubleshooting insurance claim problems and prior authorization requests, stocking new medication inventory, organizing and putting away processed and filled prescriptions, taking new and transferred prescription orders over the phone and voicemail system. I learned to balance time and prioritize tasks. My managers at both stores I worked were supportive, flexible, and willing to teach. The work environment was team-centered, we worked well with each other to work efficiently and effectively. The hardest part of the job was working in multiple workstations on days with less staff. The most enjoyable part of this job was the people I worked with and empowering patients with knowledge of their medication."
good,Great place to work but the schedule makes it tough to balance life. Benefits were awesome and the people that I worked with were great. Hard work paid off.
good,A typical day at work is when we had a little party going on for Christmas well on Christmas Eve. All of the managers were involving themselves in activates. We had Santa come to our store to take pictures with the kids. They really enjoyed themselves I love to see people happy. Although we did have a problem this one lady got upset with the cashier because the price was market wrong on the stocks. My customer service manager came over to resolve the issue and gave the customer the item for free. I've learned that when things go wrong on your job you have to remain humble at all times because you can loose your job the way you come off at the customers my manager was very considerate.
good,I loved the people I worked with. The benefits were amazing. The only thing I didn’t like is some of the managers were not great at leading people in the right manner.
good,"Publix has great benefits for this type of position, and has regular pay raises so if you work there for long enough you do well for yourself. Also if you want to advance to management, they have programs to help you with that."
good,Publix is a fantastic company even though alot about it has changed over the last 10 years.The benefits and job pay are very competitive.I enjoyed my time as an associate very much.
good,"Love the job, it is hard work.Busy, but made the time go by fast. The Deli is hard to learn because none of the meats are labled correctly, so you have to remember how they look and many look alike or very similar."
good,"A Deli Clerk's responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the following:"
good,"Best retail pharmacy chain to work for. Lately, corporate is giving the pharmacy TONS of mostly useless reports / busy work and automating 50%+ of the prescriptions; changing the role of pharmacy technicians and how important a good technician is for smooth daily operations. Pay cap is below most other chains, but the environment is better. I do like working for Publix and would recommend it to anyone considering a pharmacy career."
good,"Publix is great for benefits but there are no fixed hours. It's really hard to have a family life at Publix; But, pay and benefits are amazing! I worked for some amaing managers. If you show up and do your job, you will definitely get promoted quickly!"
good,I retired because the stock was dropping .i had 33 years..but now i. Realize il need to find another job to supplement my income and to stay busy i enjoy working and do a good job for you to the best of my knowledge.i worked for Grand union supermarkets as well.bogart years ago.sun supermarkets as well..hope you will consider me for employment.Shelby
good,"it a nice place to work in, for like retirement or when your just looking for an easy job. hardest part of the job is telling people with coupon, their coupon cannot work on their trip. but as long you under stead how coupons work, than you'll be fine."
good,Being prepare to have a friendly conversation about the simple things is a good way I learned to run the register and keep customers happy. I enjoyed working with every one there. Management was considerate the things that I enjoyed the most was customer service and working with people. The most difficult part of the job was the hours not being scheduled what I needed. I enjoyed cleaning my work area and keeping it nice and presentable.
good,The work hours are very flexible.  They do offer great health benefits and stock and 401K benefits. There is also good possibilities for raises and moving up in management.
good,"Publix is an excellent company to work for. Great people, great benefits, and opportunity to advance. However, retail has a very demanding schedule and it is hard to balance between work life and family."
good,Know the work it is easy for me I am very experienced in this field and have 29 years of experiance and what to get into management as soon as possible
good,Publix was and still is one of the best Florida companies to work for. I am looking to rejoin the Publix family soon. They are fair and have a great work atmosphere.
good,Good company to get your foot in the door as far as stock and 401k. The hours are flexible and the customer service is supreme to say the least. Proud of where I work.
good,"greeting customers and scanning groceries "
good,On occasions you get your bad apples but then you get some good apples and those some are pretty awesome and can make some forever friends who can make you laugh.
good,Working at Publix I learned to handle various typed of customers' demands. Learned how to take orders from the phone and make the order in  a timely manner.
good,It was a great company just pay wasnt that great. I will always go back maybe one day as of right now it wasnt the place for me.......................
good,Working at Publix was a good Experience for me. I learned a lot while I was in the Produce Department. I learned how to work with different people in different departments.
good,"Great benefits, hours can be tricky but they're great when you get them, simple job, and depending on the store the culture is great. I extremely dislike how frequently they switch out managers. You have just enough time to bond with your manager and then they are relocated to a different store. Some managers are better than others."
good,"long hours, fast paced, competitive, rewarding, highly compensated, family values and culture. would recommend this employer without hesitation. benefits far outweigh the stress of the job."
good,I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at publix. The customers are so friendly and my coworkers are fun to work with. The managers are cool as well. I love the pay to start with and getting paid each week is a blessing! The proposed benefits are very good and the opportunities to help in the community and/or donate to humanitarian efforts are very commendable aspects of the company. Of course there will be days that are rough and stressful but that's expected anywhere you go. It takes time getting used to taking orders over the phone and learning to make subs and cutting meats and cheeses but for the most part it's easy going and relatively low and easy maintenance!
good,"I love the company they are friendly very proffessional and makes you feel happy to work for such a postive company.Co workers are great, the managers are exceptional and welcoming and the most enjoyable part is keeping the customers happy."
good,I have learned to be independent from my career at Publix. A typical day as a decorator is very unpredictable and interesting. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing a smile on a customers' face. The hardest part of my job is nothing at all. The workplace culture is very fast paced. Management is always new because someone is always getting promoted or moved.
good,"The culture of Publix is to be a family, and the friends you make there work hard to make sure everyone can succeed. Management truly takes an interest in you and pushes you to be your best self. It's never truly a day at work when surrounded by such happy, over achieving associates. A great company to develop a career with."
good,This is a great place to work with great benefits and advancement however it gets harder to balance your personal life when you are working 50 + hours every week as Manager.
good,"I have really enjoyed my time at publix, the pay is amazing and the hours were alright. They tend to over hire or cut hours a lot and that's my reason for leaving."
good,You have to pick the items that the store or stores had ordered.You will be riding a double ride with a pallet or two.Stacking up the items you are picking for that store.Stay on one side get it go.
good,Publix cares about their employees and this is most apparent in the plethora of benefits they give to their employees.  The retirement plan is awesome!  Pay is great as well!
good,Love my job. Hardest part is at my age starting a new career and not making enough money support my family with an entry level job. It takes too long to get into management
good,This is a great place to work. Benefits are excellent and stock options even better. Does require a lot of commitment and hours especially during holidays.
good,Great place except during holidays. Benefits and stock are great. Hours during holiday season can be a bit brutal at times. Great CEO and company management.
good,Loved working for Publix and I hated that I had to quit but it was to better my future. In the 7 years I've been working this has been the best employer by FAR. Easily made into a career and could retire a millionaire.
good,I loved working here. it was always smooth and organized. management was great and always on time.you have to be fast because it does get busy at times.
good,"I worked there for 10+ years and decided to leave so that I could pursue my degree in Engineering. I worked at manufacturing plant, cleaning machines on the second shift. Sweet!"
good,Only worked part time. Publix is a very good company to work for. Potential for career advancement is high. Great benefits once you become a full time worker
good,It was a good place to work many things to keep you busy and to learn on a daily basis. You always have plenty to do. The pay is good and there is good things to buy there.
good,great company to work for. pretty flexible schedule due to making your own. very friendly and fun place to work; family oriented and the shopping there is always a pleasure!
good,"Public is a wonderful place to work, whether it's part time or full time, short time or long term. Moving up is ALWAYS an option, and possible. Management isn't far away."
good,"cash customers out, deal with attitudes and smiles, take a patient out to there car and help them with putting there groceries in the car, sometimes i got tips"
good,"Publix is the best company you could work for- hands down! They require commitment and dedication to the job and the culture and it shows in every single task you are assigned. It's a fast paced, sometimes stressful environment but it was always worth it at the end of the day."
good,It can be very difficult to get full time employment as a cashier. Overall a great place to work. The people there are very nice and willing to help teach.
good,"A typical day at Publix is getting to work at 4 am and then beginning with working your back stock on specific aisles. Next when the truck arrives unload it and then take out the bigger item pallets like water, paper, and soap to work these items before we open at 7. After we open we then off stack the remaining pallets on floats to be taken out and worked on. Once the whole truck is done you are able to go home. Usually shifts are 4am to 1pm."
good,"Left on my own,publix give everyone a fair chance of making life worth living. They work with you on what's best for you.its up to you as a person to take the opportunity and run with it.the management are very understanding of their employees"
good,very great company to work for employee owned stock options and great benefits. very hard to move up as well as receive full time position. very good pay for management.
good,"Over all Publix really is a good company. Friendly work place. Taking care of customers, plenty to do never really dull moment. I learn a great deal in cleaning, food and produces. Safety hazards and what to look out for. Food safety like cross contamination, how to take care of customers and communicate with people. It one of those jobs I actually regret leaving. If your with this company stick it out its well worth the journey. There's really nothing hard about the job probably off loading the truck if is about it. The most enjoyable part was taking of the customers yes it actually the best part of the job."
good,"going to work for publix for the first time I thought it was just a grocery store, little did I know three and a half years later that this place would grow to be my family. the benefits are awesome, the people are awesome and the stock is out the roof!"
good,"I worked for Publix Inc. for about a year. 11 months. But in that time I loved working for the company, and some days I wish I wouldn't have left, but I was forced to leave by management. This is a great company to work for, but you need to know how to beat and or challenge the system every now and then, or you won't get far."
good,"Everybody at Publix has a great attitude towards everyone and everything. All associates are all great friends with eachother. Management is super nice and accommodating for everyone, whatever your needs may be. Everyone genuinely wants to be helpful."
good,"I loved working at Publix.  If I had not relocated to Indiana I would have stayed."
good,"Publix is a great company to work for and offers great advancement opportunities. Also offer many perks like stock options, dividends and holiday bonus"
good,everyday is different no day is the same you meet different people every day and build a friendship with the regular customer there are nice customers and there are rude customers
good,Very quick paced. You have to catch on fast or you wouldn't be moved up as quick. You have to  be able to deal with all types of customers especially mean ones.
good,"Publix is a great place to work!  What you put in is exactly what you get out. Working for publix you should always smile, put the needs of customers first, and always provide premier customer service, and remember take care of the customers tge way you would like to be taken care of."
good,Good place to work. The bakery/decorating area has a lot more negative talk simply because of being in a very small area. I enjoyed the work and being busy.
good,Worked as a full-time stock clerk for two years loading and unloading trucks.stocked shelves and took inventories.for 15 years I was a produce mgr.made orders and managed people.
good,Good benefits great company free lunch stock options great place for career advancement. ...the pay is good the hours are long and you might have 10 straight days of work before your 1st day off.
good,Being a retail environment it is understandable to find flaws in the types of co-workers you encounter here. My main concern with Publix is its business plan which is no longer clear. As a matter of opinion through 10+ years of service their execution of their 5 major principals has faltered a bit in the last 3 years and I hope to see them get back on track. They offer some of the best benefits you can find anywhere and the opportunity of a career here is excellent as long as you acknowledge the amount of effort required and proper disposition to achieve it.
good,"working here is great especially if you start young. can gain stock within the company as you continue to stay and with the benefits that you recieve as full time, its worth the long run. if you are looking for a place to grow or invest in a career i would take a look into this company now."
good,"Publix, I believe, in the town of inverness, Florida,  is the only ""Great"" place to work. Has great benefits and you can move up quickly if you desire too. "
good,I have enjoyed working for Publix. It is a very good work environment with lots of fun people. There are many opportunities for advancement for those who want to make Publix a career.
good,"Publix is a good place to work at, but standing in one spot for hours a day is not good for your body. I like it because you get to meet many customers. But working at a grocery gets little boring cause you deal with the same thing everyday."
good,"Great Place for career advancement. typical day, you'll meet your regular customers. you will gain good communication skills. The hardest part of the job is carts. easiest is the bagging and scanning."
good,I really liked working at Publix.  I even looked forward to it.  The customers were happy because we emphasized excellent customer service.  I would work there again.
good,Great comapany but managers can be stuck up and snooty. The benefits are amazing it's a E sock company  so it's employee owed.  Health insurance dental insurance and eye insurance are  available.
good,"I started my working life with Publix and it's a great place to get your feet wet. They build strong character in a person there and mold each employee with a great belief in customer service and loyalty. I worked there in high school and continued through college. I appreciate all of the lessons I was taught during my years there,"
good,"As an introductory job or as a career option, Publix provides many opportunities for a wide variety of individuals. With benefits ranging from health and dental plans to 401k supplementation, the company is almost unparalleled when it comes to accessory benefits. The overall job atmosphere lends itself heavily to the employees. If you like your coworkers, the job tends to be easy and stress free. However, I cannot speak on behalf of those who didn't like their coworkers."
good,"I enjoyed every minute of my work day. From helping customers, to unloading a truck. Everyone that i worked with really became more like family to me."
good,Working at Publix was challenging but also very rewarding. Publix was always very busy but it keeps you on your toes. Seeing people everyday help boost my customer service and preparing the deli food fast is challenging as well. Management was ok and they were really nice.
good,Hate their tardy policy but other than that the environment is good. As long as the team around you is good the work atmosphere is fun. Publix is a good 1st job to have.
good,"I enjoy my time at Publix each day the environment is positive and helps me interact with others by helping them solve issues and find products, the management is super supportive and understanding no matter what and they are very fair with how they treat everyone. the hardest part of my job is definitely pulling out thousand pound pallets with a pallet jack and rushing to break them all down and load the shelves before we close. I would definitely say the most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the customers because the environment is so positive."
good,"Benefits are good, the overall rate depends on where you work and what warehouse. The management is not what it supposed to be but again its all in what location your at"
good,"I had some of the best times working at Publix. Great supervisors and people to work with. Some were not to great but along good."
good,"I am a very hard worker, yet a very nice person. I always manage to keep a well organized working environment. My work is always satisfactory. I always have good associate relationship."
good,Work product to the shelves and ensure we did not run out of any product.  Review truck orders and maintain count accuracy in the grocery department.  Keep all areas of the entire store cleaned and ready for inspection at all times.  Attention to detail is how to excel here.  I loved working along side with my comrades getting things done.  I learned so much about how a business is supposed to be ran here.  I think some managers are really great and some forget where they came from.
good,Great company that offers a lot of chances for advancement. As well as great benefits like good insurance plans and ways to earn shares in stock being that it is an employee owned company.
good,"Publix is a fantastic company to work for. Competitive pay, many benefits after 6 months/1 year. Benefits include 401k, insurance, etc. They're really good to associates and the management is quite helpful"
good,"Assist Operators in setup. Repair several minor to major machine problems ranging from improper setup to mechanical, electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, welding, or PLC related issues."
good,"In my view, Publix is a great place to work. The hours are flexible and the compensation is great; however, managers can sometimes be hard to talk to. I have to say the most enjoyable part is the customer interaction as they always provide soe interesting conversation while I assisted them."
good,Publix is a great company to work for. The hours are great and so was the staff. My coworkers were fun to work around and they made the job easier. The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving bonus thru the hoildays
good,Publix is the top of the supermarket chains for customer service and overall value. Working for Publix is a rewarding experience that is geared toward goal-oriented individuals. The benefits and career building opportunities make Publix a great place to work.
good,"Publix was the first job. I started at age 16 as a front service clerk. I worked my way up to a position leading to management. They never hire outside the store for management, meaning everyone works their way up. Team lead is the head C.S. staff for management. We hire, train, and run the daily goings of the front end. I learned all about different personalities, how to handle difficult situations, and all administration work for the store."
good,"I have nothing bad to said about publix just a great company to be apart of.free workout,they feed you and give you a piece of the company.what more can you ask 4?"
good,I loved talking to the customers because they made me feel at home. This was my first job so I pretty much learned how to do a lot such as cashiering and bagging groceries. I enjoyed my experience everyday at this job.
good,I worked with publix for three years and i absolutely love this company. They have given me a raise every six months. After 1000 hours provided health insurance and after six months 401k. Great company to work for.
good,"The co- workers varies, there are some who's fun to work with and others who are not. Management also varies, they have their good days and bad days."
good,"I am responsible for customer service, packing, stocking floors, cleaning and closing the bakery. I left Publix because we moved here and the Publix in Lebanon is too far to drive."
good,Employees are all good spirited confortable environment betweeen employees. But demand is getting higher more and more expectations and no growth to compensate. Too stressful on a individual level (in the Deli)
good,"The job feels more like reward than a job. The people and stories that come through your line make very new interaction as fulfillingas the last.  Not to mention the coworkers and management, the work environment is designed to make you feel like what you are doing is just as important as the store. Manager and that the store stands by you assessment. In a word perfect."
good,Great work place great benefits good pay loved the hours and rotating scedule. Benfits were awsome got some work done became forkluft certified while employed there and learned great things
good,"Consistent customer service, friendly co-workers, how to deal with customers and fellow associates.  Medical, Dental, and Vision benefits, vacation and sick time offered."
good,"A very good place to work, great co-workers, good engagement with customers, hardest part of the Job is keeping up with the needs of the customers, but doable."
good,"Great job to work for but company isn't really mind full of you trying to continue your education, not very flexible with working with hours for going to college."
good,"A great place to work, company shows their employees appreciation and awards the employees. company benefits are really good, and they award us with quarterly bonuses."
good,"Working at Publix was a very fun and easy job, I looked forward to going to work everyday. All of my coworkers were very nice and easy. The managers were easy to talk to and i loved the open door policy. They were always understanding about things and they actually listened to others opinions on things and showed us that they cared about us."
good,"Normally really good co-workers, bosses can be hit and miss but they rotate the management constantly so you're never stuck with someone for too long. Decent pay, excellent benefits."
good,"Amazing company, always puts the customer first. Does a god job of pushing customer service above bottom line. Hard to advance but can be worthwhile."
good,"Publix is a good place to work - "
good,"The stock options for Publix are great, as well as the occasional benefits for being an employee. Plenty of opportunities for advancement, and great people to work with. The only thing I didn't enjoy were the hours. Waking up at 2:30am to cut fruit at 3:00am was great for my school schedule, but not good for whenever I wanted to do anything other than work at school."
good,"At Publix, a typical day at work in the Deli usually revolved on several high an low points during the day, alongside constant variables. A day's customer volume would depend almost entirely on a number of factors alone: The weather outside, the day of the week, even the time of year. Working behind the counter did reveal a multitude of valuable skills and assets including but not limited to: Training courses on the quality of cold cuts and fresh cheeses, operation of deli equipment like slicers and industrial coolers, proper sanitation and cleaning habits, and courtesy and respect for not only the customer, but those who work behind the counter as well. Management was never quite set in stone, as during my time there we had gone through three assistant managers, however each one brought something new to the table. Co-Workers would make a day enjoyable or miserable. When you have people working together, there will always be some who do not mesh. Though I never had anyone that upset me, there occasionally was some form of argument among the others. However, for the majority of my time there, it was quite pleasant. The hardest part of the job is easily the customers. So unpredictable in nature, there's always a chance that no matter what you do, you may end up assisting somebody who can just simply not be pleased. However, the flip side being that the honest, pleasant customers make working at Publix a rewarding and satisfying experience."
good,The bakery is always full of smiles and laughter and everyone is always willing to help out other co-workers no matter what department they work in.
good,"Typical day at work consists of coordinating a schedule that my fellow associates abide by to focus on a smooth operating system. Handling large amounts of cash whether it is dealing with Western Union, Money Orders, Checks, or lotto. Providing premier customer service is the main focus on a daily basis."
good,"Publix has always been willing to work with me no matter what I need  to accommodate in life, weather it was going to school or having a family. Management was always willing to help out with making my learning experience more efficient. Associates were always friendly and made work enjoyable. The hardest part of my job was leaving it in December to pursue my Masters."
good,Loved working at Publix. Enjoyed the customers they made my day when I went to work. Life was meaningful and worth living.
good,"i went to work as a grocery clerk stoker"
good,A typical day at work would be in the middle of fast-paced and slow-paced. We could have a extremely dead moment and the next business would be booming. The management at Publix is very nice and understanding. The co-workers are easy to get along with and help the day go by a little faster. The most enjoyable parts and the hardest part of the job is the rushes we get occasionally.
good,"Loved the opportunities available here, but they claim to promote from within. I was working full-time and going to college full-time to help in my advancement within the company and they were not willing to work with me schedule wise so I could complete test and assignments. Final outcome was being reduced to part-time and a $2.00 an hour pay cut."
good,I mean I go out of my way every day to give excellent service to each customer. Smiling is contagious they almost always smile back and I constantly ask if further assistance is needed. One of the things that I learn is people will always remember how you make them feel. I'd ask about their family or  how's your son or daughter doing and their response: I can see their face lit up and they'd say ''oh you remember me  they're doing fine thanks for asking'' That's the kind of customer relationship I build and it's the same with my co-workers. The not to pleasant part would be dealing with a customer who's not happy about something and because I keep a good attitude I'm usually able to manage the situation or bring a manager in.
good,"Excellent pay and benefits.  Caring associates. Took many training  classes to  keep up to date on EEOC, Human Resources, Leading and Development of associates. Trained to work in every aspect of the store"
good,There are many different departments and positions that Publix has to offer for future employees. While working at Publix distribution center you are busy from the moment you clock into work and the work doesn't let up until you have finished your shift and clock out. There is no easy job at Publix but the rewards that you earn make this company very much worth applying for.
good,Publix is such a great company to work for. From being employee owned and the benefits I think its a great job for anybody. The people above you are always willing to teach you new skills. I have learned many new skills from working here.
good,Publix was a wonderful place to work because it taught me good customer service and that is also needed in the medical field. It taught me how to be personable with people and make relationships with people that I had just met. I learned to communicate with people in a much better way than I had before. I learned the value of taking pride in what you do and how a smiling face can turn anyones day around. At publix I was a cashier and bagger. I rang up customers orders and completed there transactions. At the end of my shift I would count my drawer and close it out. I would also bag customers groceries and take them out to the customers vehicle.
good,Making every single customer happy. I love to serve custumers and seen them smilling and saying thank you at the end. Working for Publix was a pleassure.
good,It is very satisfying to work for a company that greatly focuses on customer service along with focusing on the needs of the employees. The most enjoyable part of working for Publix is gaining  respectful relationships with repeat guests while maintaining amazing teamwork to focus on tasks at hand.
good,great experience meeting new people on a daily basis. Publix had alot of culture and structure very strict .great company to move up in.
good,"Publix is a great company, they just don't have the hours to give. I can't live on 15hrs a week. I really love Publix it's a very good place to work... but like I said I can't live on 15hrs aweek. My husband works for them he is in management and has been with the company for 23 yrs."
good,"I love working for Publix, but in the last 2 years I feel the company does not put the patient first. We were  such a customer service oriented company, but now I feel its all about the dollars. I love all my co-workers and my store manager. I am looking for another job to learn something new in pharmacy, like specialty. I also have become tired of standing for 12 hour days on my feet with no cushion support since Publix no longer allows fatigue mats in their pharmacies."

Was responsible for all cash, including safe room, atm, vending machines, check cashing station, etc.  Also handled all customer service complaints. Checked and handed out payroll.  Became United Way coordinator for our store, created money making events, such as car wash, sidewalk sale, hot dog and drink sale,  Associate competition, etc, and raised upwards of $30,000.00 for United Way Campaign."
good,"I thoroughly enjoy working for publix, they taught you what you needed to no and more,the employees and mangment were great."
good,"Great place to work with some supportive managers. Rewards for working and being safe. Like all big companies there is politics and red tape to deal with, but that's expected. The most enjoyable part, finding the position that fits you best!"
good,"This is a good place to work for but could use a little better communication and organization. A plus was if you were doing a good job and deserved praise you got it, you knew your work was appreciated."
good,"great company to work for, everyone is nice and does their job accordingly."
good,i liked being able to volunteer for community events  and the training was excellent  advancement was harder. when you wished to learn a new skill or cross train you were sent straight to a class to learn  example i started in aprons cooking for customers with samples when I wanted to lears cake decorating they sent me to another store to lears from a decorator  I was also cross trained as a cashier and was sometimes scheduled up front

good,Publix is a great place to work. Definitely balances schedule for school and work. It has been 5 years and 3 months of pleasure working for this particular company.
good,"I would highly recommend working for Publix at Haile. The managers were kind and understanding, I had no qualms with any of the co-workers, and the myriad of benefits you can receive for working there are fantastic."
good,A GREAT PLACE TO WORK FOR .Great experience working with good people feels like family.Concentrating on customer services keeping the department up to Publix standrs.
good,I love being able to help people enjoy a task we all have to undertake. If I can make someones shopping experience pleasant then it makes me feel good. I know that we provide great customer service to all that come into the store. I have learned a lot about myself and how to deal with the public. I have learned a lot about conflict resolution and multitasking. My managers work very hard along side us and will do any job that they ask us to do. They lead my example. I also love helping people learn ways to save money on their grocery bill. The hardest part of my job is the hours. Being retail there is no set times or days off. Being a single mom with teens this makes many things very difficult.
good,the hardest part of my job is working with people that dont care and call out sick and I have to cover them and work way to many hours because I an salery Publix is a great company
good,"Great, employee-owned company. The work culture is positive and provides many opportunities for advancement to management."
good,working at publix you meet different people who live in the neighbor and sometimes from different countries hat come to grab some groceries. we have conversations with them learning their way of living and even what its like to be in a different atmosphere.
good,I enjoyed my career at Publix. I met many different people and learned many different skills. Opportunity for advancement into management was always offered and the benefits were very good. The downfalls were having to constantly work holidays and the pay for the associates who chose not to go into management is difficult to live on.
good,All managers are willing to help you advance. Flexible with your schedule. Great benefits and the give you 401k plan. They care about the employees and customers.
good,I love my job at Publix. It is fun and I met lots of cool people but honestly the amount i put in to my job everyday and not to get anything in return is really hard.
good,I loved working at Publix. I loved being able to communicate with our regular customers and develop a relationship with them. I also had a very good professional relationship with my supervisors.
good,"I was blessed with an amazing store and management group. The Deli Department was HARD WORK which I do not shy away from, I relish it. I am by nature NOT a lazy person & like to get the job done efficiently and quickly. I look for ways to streamline my process and to constantly perfect my work & work habits.  The job was physically demanding, but that aside, our customers made it all worthwhile, especially when you see them all the time, it allows you to have a personal relationship with them & makes them feel special when you greet them by name & with a genuine smile. Especially our older clientele."
good,"I love Publix as a company, they do so many great things for their employees, the community and provide many great products for customers. Once you get through the first year the financial opportunities start to grow with lots of great benefits for full time employees and being a part of the company. Publix hires great employees and everyone I work with is wonderful to be around."
good,"My typical day will be coming to the warehouse with my uniform on with my steel toe boots, also signing in with the company on paper to let them know im here and what time I arrive also all the employees will huddle up and we will do a stretch when we will be finish with that we will jump on are forklift operator and get to work put a sign on the truck mirror and chop the wheels and some loads will be a two men truck or a one man truck so the dock manager will decide what truck he wants us to do so I will go into the 18 wheeler with my forklift and take it off the truck and break it down to how publix wants it."
good,Days consist of dealing with the public in a face to face environment.   I learned quickly how to properly speak to the public and resolve their conflicts as well as my own.
good,"cashier, helping customers in the best way you can...meeting all kinds of people not only neighborhood customers but from different countries and states that come here to visit florida"
good,"Typical day starts off receiving orders and unloading packages from trucks. I learned how to Maintain a clean work environment by cleaning and maintain equipment used for unloading and loading the inventory. Also, fulfilled orders for drivers and loaded or unloaded trucks daily by hand, two wheeler or pallet jack if one was available or needed. Management pretty much walked around if workers were not working at the pace they wanted. Co-workers were let go and hired just as fast as the work day was over. We all started off as temps until we could get hired on to the job if you were good at your craft or position. The hardest part was trying to get everyone on the same page because it was all about team work. The most enjoyable part was working together to get the work done. As long as everybody was working together the job was going to get done on time."
good,"I love working here, I love the people, I love the work. I've been in employed in the deli and the bakery. I don't mind spending 40-50 hours a week here."
good,"Data entry, workload balancing, and product dispensing are just a few of the everyday procedures that have to be completed"
good,"from what I remember about publix, it was a great work environment with great management and coworkers. I had a great deal of customers that remembered me past working at Publix that I continue to see at my current job"
good,"Morning hours, physical labor, normal breaks"
good,Loved working here Managers were always helpful and fun to be around. Lots of benefits Closed on major holidays training was not always the best but they always helped when you needed it.
good,Publix pays very well and they take care of their workers as far as pay and benefits but on the other hand if you are going for a higher position and you are juggling school they aren't very helpful with working with your schedule. I worked at two Publix the first one the environment was nice with friendly managers and customers but when I transferred to Boca it was a total 360 so I believe the people you work with will determine what you take from Publix.
good,"Publix is a peoples place. you get to interact with the public, meet all races and help the public. I've learned to be a better peoples person and at the same time learn different things to move up in the company. my manager is a fun and up lifting person at times. the hardest part of the ob is dealing with impatient customers. The most enjoyable part of the of the job is being able to come ro a ob were the environment is smooth sailing."
good,Publix is a great place to work. The pay and benefits are phenomenal. I learned extreme customer service standards from Publix. As well as food safety and associate relation skills
good,"Fast pace environment where customer service was the number one priority. Pujblix showed me the value of taking care of your customers and the rewards of it. With the experience I learned work for them, I believe I can become a great asset as well as manager for ANY COMPANY."
good,i love working here it was a great place to work in general....
good,"Between the front end as a cashier; and the back as a bakery clerk, I learned so much between my two different stores. Publix is an very beneficial company to work with as well. The 401k plans, stocks, SOME managers, SOME co workers, and benefits are easy to deal with. If I was offered a position with this company; at a higher start off pay, I would definitely accept."
good,This was a hard Implementation of Peregrine ServiceCenter 6.0 because the company had been using the mainframe IBM tool for years and resisted the upgrade. The people were very professional and very challenging because the change from mainframe to client server was a big impact on how they do business. the hardest part was convincing the IT managers that this new tool would help them in the long run. The best part was watching them use the tool as a satisfied customer
good,"Filling sale floor."
good,"Picked product orders for multiple stores, restocked racks and inventory, shipping and receiving."
good,Good company to work for!! If you don't like people then don't ever get a job as a cashier! Patience is the key. you will need lots of it! I worked for one of the biggest stores In Orlando and we were always busy! I transferred to a store in St. Petersburg FL and so far its ok! But for me I'm over the customer service face to face day to day job! Looking for something else ASAP!!!
good,"Great place to work but am on the DL but can still work, They won't let me work because I can;t wear my support boot for my broken foot."
good,Great company to work for!!!! nothing bad to say work l;ife and balance you are rewarded for the job that you asked to do...
good,"Publix gave me the confidence that I needed to grow into the person that I am today. There were some challenges that identified some of my weaknesses, and because of that I am able to move forward posivtively without regret. I really enjoyed working with the new associates and heiping them to see the Publix Culture . Some of my co-workers and Management were difficult at times but we were able to look past some of the distractions and get the job done."
good,"I absolutely loved working for Publix, though it was very hard to get a job there. We got paid weekly, the schedule was always ready ahead of time, they are flexible with scheduling however they were VERY strict about finding your own replacement."
good,"We where kept busy, I learned many skills, customer service skills that had helped me later in life. The management team we had was every helpful and fun to work with. My co-workers where also good to work with, we became a very good team, helpful to each other as well as the customers. "
good,"i would like to talk with customers, my favorite is my co workers"
