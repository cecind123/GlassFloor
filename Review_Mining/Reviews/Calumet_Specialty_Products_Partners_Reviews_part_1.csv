bad,"Sorriest company I ever worked for....poorly managed by liars!"
bad,"Corporate Management is at its all time worst.  People have quit at this job consistently for the last 3 years.  Nevermind the salary and think of how people are treated.  You get used and disposed of and this kind of culture is what has been driving this exodus.  If you are about to get foreclosed and need a place to work, this may work out for you, otherwise, stay away from this place."
bad,Upper management runs all over middle management and does not listen to the recommendations and needs middle management tells them. Instead they mostly just do whatever they want even when they are told it is the wrong thing to do. They basically hire people to do a job then don't listen to anything those people say. Why hire for a specific skill set then ignore that skill's directions? Isn't that why you hired them? Basically only yes men agreeing to bad ideas get anywhere here because if you speak up with the truth certain members of upper management will have it out for you.
bad,"Local management just doesn't want to be bothered. They don't care what is going on in their area. They don't care about the employees. They just want to look good for corporate. If you are starving to death, they are about to repossess your car and your home is in foreclosure, work here until you find something else.  If those things don't apply to you, keep looking.  You will be worked to death and totally not appreciated. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management that is totally unqualified to manage but wants to hide that from corporate."
bad,"There was too much work, and too many hours. Also, there was no work life balance which is important. The people were nice but needed more direction in daily work."
bad,"More concerned with corporate growth, than the welfare of their customers and employees."
bad,I enjoyed my time working at this location. There are a lot of good people working here doing their best to keep the refinery profitable. I left only because my manager kept cancelling my vacation with less than 24 hours notice.
bad,"Calumet is a poor work environment and cares nothing about the people. Long hours, overworked and underpaid. Management is clueless and does not care to change. Its an all about them mentality. Very top heavy and very few workers. Very selfish."
bad,"I don't even know where to start.  The company is completely shady financially.  They should be investigated by the SEC.  Executive leadership is incompetent and only out for their own pocketbooks.  They are completely out of touch with the mass employee base.  There is no accountability to speak of.  People are horrible to one another, for no apparent reason other than they can be and nothing will happen.  "
bad,"Clueless clowns in upper management, no idea how to manage a profitable business, or KEEP qualified employees."
bad,"Family and friends type of business.  If you are content to fall in place and exist, this may be the place for you.  If you try to excel the business and your career, suggest you keep looking."
bad,"The salary is good, the benefits are ok, they offer medical however it is not a very good plan many things are not covered. The management is very unprofessional resulting in a hostile work environment."
bad,"Management and Human Resource department is terrible. No communication what so ever and a lot of politics come into play. You need to kiss a lot of butt to become ""somebody"". Place is a joke"
bad,"Lack of training. Management showed extreme favoritism and lacked accountability. Little to no room for growth. Does not fairly compensate employees based on workload, merit or tenure. Overall, would not recommend."
bad,A pass the buck environment. With LAZY management & Supervisors. No training put into place. No guidelines or system for everyday work. And once again the worse supervisors in the World!!!
bad,"Since this was a temporary assignment, I was not here long enough to have an opinion on the company. I was just for a SAP live migration event for the company"
bad,The company acquired many other companies in a very short period of time. It did not have the appropriate infrastructure in place to handle the growth. They are desperately in need of qualified people.
bad,"Great facility, for the most part; however, this contributing factor, characterizes the overall negative environment to the warehouse. In addition, the low compensation and Insurance is low-rate, so this may create financial issues."
bad,My review of the company may be a bit tainted given the circumstances of my leaving Calumet. Calumet was a great company to work for. There was a great work/life balance. The executives cared and listened to the employees of the company. The relationships with all departments was wonderful. Communication between departments could not have been better. Then things changed. I have great friends at Calumet and I will remember my time there fondly.
good,"A typical day is 4:23am to 4:30pm Day Shift  and"
good,"Needs better support learning environment.  Being able to take time to improve, train, classes to improve job and support the company. "
good,"A typical day was productive at Calumet.  I learned how to use additional software packages.  The work culture was stressful due to management.  There were no specific rules, rules changed daily and was hard to keep up with.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the helpfulness of a few co-workers."
good,"Pay is not bad, and the people I have worked with are awesome.   NO career opportunities, training, or mentoring.  Just a job... Which is unfortunate."
good,Very hot in the summer time but overall it's a OK place to work at lot of trucks come in to be unloaded and loaded but overall I would say it's a good job.
good,Demanding and stress full environment. The schedule can be nice but most of the time you end up working on your days off. It is a 24/7 operation and shift work schedule.
good,"Major duties as lab manager and quality control."
good,I worked there almost a year and was supposed to be hired on in 6 months. Not only did I not get on most people spend up to 5 years working through a agency or contractor before being rolled over . Then management was changed over crimes then ironically I was fired two months later.lol
good,"Management listens to employees and helps to get things resolved."
good,"Upper management has been trying to standardize practice across all branches without hearing how each division of the business runs. "
good,"Typical work day is normally good if there are not any unit upsets. ive learned and retained a lot of information about the refinery in how the process is developed. There is poor communication with management due to no person to person interaction on unit situations and  new development. The workplace environment with co-workers is excellent especially during  a unit upset, which is the hardest part of the job. The co-workers is by far the most enjoyable part of the job being that we r under staffed for the work load given to each individual."
good,Loved my job!!  Not many people can say they liked going to work...  I learned so much during my career with Calumet.  The refinery I worked in had many challenges.  This made being a solid performer in the market impossible.
good,A typical day in logistics was setting up trucks daily. Scheduling inbound and outbound freight. Printing BOLs in the SAP system for drivers. The most enjoyable part was my coworkers and learning from them.
good,"Calumet got into some financial issues and the stock price plummeted.  Many were afraid for the future of the company and left to find more secure employment, including myself.  They seem to be recovering now somewhat."
good,Very friendly environment and nice place to work in.I've improved my chemical engineering skills during my career with Calumet.
good,"Fast paced, keep to yourself or everyone will know your business, great advancement opportunities, the pricing Manager is very helpful and encouraging."
good,Great group of people to work with.  I liked working independently but there was always someone willing to help if needed.
good,Excellent business to be a part of.  Entrepreneurial spirit.  The ability to work on own.  Had excellent sales force which I assembled and had responsibility for.  Wrote yearly business plan.
good,"Actually like working for Calumet, Great People and always something to do. Good overall pay for the work. However, there is no promotion potential at all."
good,Never boring because every day was different. I learned many different skills. The management provided all necessary tools to complete any and all tasks. Very dangerous work but fantastic coworkers.
good,"A company that will make you a well rounded individual, it taught me so many things about my job and many more. Management does care about you but you have to be willing to put the effort to make sure you are someone who is worth it."
good,I really enjoyed working there. I left due to medical reasons.  Nothing to do with the company.  My supervisor was constantly involving me in new projects and made me feel important and an asset to the company.
good,"12 hours shifts, which rotate between day and night."
good,I like the Dupont schedule I work. I feel like family here. I am required to use at least 1 50 characters. This is all I need to say. I should not be required to use 150 characters.
good,The hardest part was getting use to different management. I learned to keep same routine and same consistency.  Everyone got along with each other and work as a team. I use to learn every machine and different jobs
good,"I knew from the minute I interviewed with this company that this was where I wanted to work. I loved the company, the people and the job I was assigned to do. It was unfortunate that their financial status forced them to eliminate several positions in order to continue to operate in a good manner."
good,I loved my job here. I would still be here but unfortunately my department moved to Houston and was not needed in the Indianapolis area.  Everyone is nice to work with. Professional atmosphere. Down to earth people and management. Great benefits and pay. Weekends off. I felt the overall atmosphere and attitudes were classy and very impressive. If you do not work here then being a customer would be a fair and honest business relationship guaranteed.
good,So helpful I hope to see yall soon I worked for NaborDrilling co got laid off looking for a job with the same benefits and pay scale I think I would be a great asset to your company hopefully our company
good,I like workin there. It’s was a good work Schedule off on weekends and holidays... if I had the chance to go back I would... I just hate mii Transportation stop on me so I had to quit
good,"Great place to work. Highly recommended they will take care of you .  definently   a retirement job great benefits and great hours, Vacation is descent ."
