rating,review
bad,"Started at company 8+yrs ago, facility is old, equipment is old and antiquated, maintained by good staff, but shortfunded by management for last 5-6yrs, with the addition of outdated parts and OS that are difficult to aquire,  mostly 80's plc style controls, horrendous 28 rotating shift schedule"
bad,"I resent this. I like my privacy.   I should not be forced in to providing information of any kind that i do not wish to. "
bad,No es precisamente el tipo de trabajo que busco y buscaba en esos momentos debido a que el salario en la empresa es muy bajo.
bad,"If you are an older woman at OI you had better keep you're mouth shut.  Don't report ANY mistreatment that you receive, as it will be turned around and used against you.  Management will lie about you to HR and then you will be singled out and then lied about to the point were you are told by HR to shut up or you will be terminated.  Favoritism and nepotisms to some are the norm at OI.  "
bad,"Worst company I ever worked for. Low salary, ineffective management, harassment and micro-managing is the culture here."
bad,The company is one of the worse run business in the US.  The culture is a though back to the 50's.  Very poor relations with employees and do nt invest in their assets.
bad,"Real Neat  responsibilities include schedule preparation, pre-planning and resource forecasting for engineering and other technical activities relating to the project."
bad,"The Plant is closed"
bad,"This plant in Lexington, NC has seen several plant managers over th e years. There is complete lack of consistency when applying policies and procedures. Employees at the plant typically get to keep their jobs even after committing major policy violations. It is a unionized plant and the union typically runs the plant. There is no drug testing done when employees are involved in an accident. Policies are written down on paper but rarely ever applied. The plant managers have very little regard for HR and HR is always kept in the dark about union issues and employee issues."
bad,"The management, cheat, lie and their integrity is non existent. I feel so sorry for the BIG name clients which they have whom pay money for products - in my opinion are not safe or fit for purpose. For that reason I have chosen not to buy/use products which include some of my favourite brands as I know exactly the shady processes the Scottish factory uses to make them."
bad,From the top managers on down absolutely nothing but negativity. Never a good comment to the employees. Most of the management will not even carry a normal conversation with the hourly employees  FORCED mandatory overtime if you like it or not. If you turn down a mandatory double shift you will get points for absenteeism. Constantly under staffed shifts and therefore someone is going to get forced into a double shift. The absolute worst maintained machines and are literally falling apart. Constantly getting switched around to different shifts. If are a family person do yourself a favor and AVOID working at Owens. Divorce rate here is astronomical!  Have “wanna-be” union supervisors that are actually worse than the company supervisors. The only good thing there is the co-workers.
bad,"Sem dúvida uma grande empresa, presente em diversos países e com uma grande expressão mundial."
bad,Totally out of control operation that offered little to no support to correct issues. Maintenance was always needed yet usually unavailable leaving the department struggling. Management offered lip service but no support. Union was difficult as well.
bad,"The rotating swing shifts on a weekly basis take a negative toll on human health, happiness and relationships. The working environment engendered by management, takes a very serious toll on human health (i.e. high levels of microwave frequencies emitted from numerous commercial WiFi transmitters located throughout the facility). Many employees have discernible problems (i.e. joint pain, premature ageing issues, psychological/behavioral issues, etc...) Despite bringing such issues to managements attention, nothing discernible was done to change said circumstances. Be warned, the amount of electrical radiation inside this facility is extremely high and causes oxidative stress on biological entities. In addition, the company makes you aware that asbestos is present within the facility, so enter at your own risk!"
bad,"Constant witch hunt from bully boy micro managers who have no clue about man management and just threaten you with daily warnings or even the sack. Whole workforce totally demoralised to point of resigning(some already have). New company changes mean more working days per year and one 3 week holiday per YEAR. Your punished for being off sick by not paying you and removing your bonus for that month. During your shift your on your own with no support regardless of whether you can cope or not, then treated like dirt for your efforts"
bad,"The building is over 50 years old and has not had any upgrades to this day. all the machines are run down and makes bad product but yet blames all the problems on the employees.when it rains outside it rains and makes big puddles of water inside the building also. All the supervisor has real bad attitudes with employee.there is no team work within this company at all ,it seems that no one likes one another, which is why the company is failing.has random big layoffs"
bad,"Management style is flavor of the month.   In 12 years watched the company go from a traditional management  to engaging people by creating a ""wellness culrure"", to ""people are like rubber bands,  you have to keep them under constant tension."" "
bad,"Terrible environment. Good ol’ boy mentality. Unorganized management and high turn over. "
bad,The most dysfunctional work place I have ever worked. Management vs Hourly. This place will not be open much longer. No professionalism. Management team by far are the most unprofessional  Un educated rednecks in Georgia !!
bad,"Owens-Illinois, Inc. (NYSE: OI) is the world's largest glass container manufacturer and preferred partner for many of the world's leading food and beverage brands. The Company had revenues of $6.9 billion in 2017 and employs more than 26,500 people at 78 plants in 23 countries. With global headquarters in Perrysburg, Ohio, O-I delivers safe, sustainable, pure, iconic, brand-building glass packaging to a growing global marketplace."
bad,"Management yells and curses employees. Atlanta facility was not profitable for 10+ years. Plantation environment, with restrooms that are nasty and have been for years. You would only use the restrooms standing up.."
bad,The only good thing about OI was the pay and benefits. Employees were treated very poorly by management and the HR department is extremely biased and racist. Very rarely is good work appreciated and unless you are buddy buddy with management there's no possibility of advancing in the company. Don't apply unless you're capable of taking no pride in you're work!
bad,"Although the pay and benefits were good, the swing shift is no way to run a company.  I was told that the union employees voted to keep the swing shift and that's why it is still in effect.  While I worked there, everyone was looking for another job because of the swing shift and poor management."
bad,Company only looks after your well being as long as things are going good. If you get an illness they will can you. Morals are not of high value. They bring outsiders in with no glass knowledge and pass over the more experience ones. They expect the old school employees to train the new ones and give the new ones the better jobs. Not very much training for the hourly employees because the young managers do not know themselves.
bad,"Great opportunities and personalized attention is offered for the first year, and great new-hires orientation programs."
bad,There i's no communication..the men treat you with disrespect an talk to you in a nasty manner you tell management an they tell you deal with it. The smoke in the hiding places over half including management do drugs an drink on site
bad,Horrible work schedules. No consideration for employees and their families.
bad,"The workers are messy, management is crooked. Ive never worked in a place where management does drugs and sells the warehouse equipment but still have jobs. The benefits are great and pay is great. The swing shift is hatd on the body."
bad,Company is judgmental and not willing to train new employees the way they should. They will place you on the floor with no training and you just have to figure out the way to operate machines on your own. Supervisors are not helpful at all either
bad,In Management we work very long hours and several days straight without any time off. it is expected to be on call 24 hours a day 7 days a week. even when on holiday.
bad,Great pay. Hours suck at times but my biggest issue is I don't see an opportunity for blacks to move into salary positions which is extremely sad. Everything is based on the buddy system. Most people given salary jobs are guys who are friends with other salary guys whether they are capable of doing the job or not. This must change. Yet I doubt it will. I'm also positive corporate doesn't thoroughly evaluate their salary people because if they did they would learn that 60% of them should be allowed to make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches
bad,"I had to leave sich an terrible workplace..people were miserable, but people put up with it bc they needed a paycheck. Felt racial tension ..in a black city, all upper management was white..."
bad,Too much management. Top heavy and treat hourly like second hand help. They have an hr woman who acts like the plant manager and they try to change the leadership structure way too often making you feel like you have 4 different bosses at any given time. They pay well but everyone that works there hates their jobs they just know they can’t make that much money anywhere else. I am happy to not be with them anymore
bad,"Loud, dirty, management is terrible, union is a joke; NOT drug free, and management doesn't care about harassment either! No family life! Stay far far away!!! Will ruin any life you might want to hold stable."
bad,"Honestly don't know how this plant is still open. Dump glass every day on every shift, reject ware constantly, management has no control over staff,  favoritism throughout the plant; promoting unqualified workers instead of hiring outside qualified and educated workers. Safety is a joke. If random drug tests were done, no one would have a job. If you have small children or want to keep your family intact, stay far away from this place! Rotate shifts every 5 days and no downtime."
bad,"Fair wages, but no recognition for job.  Very much a ""Us against them"" supervisory attitude.  No team atmosphere present and no support for lower employees."
bad,"I have been there a total of ten years and over the years moral and direction has gone down tremendously.  New talent stays long enough to be able to put O-I on their resume in order to advance to a better paying job."
bad,very hot. not a clean place to work. dirty with glass and chemicals floating in the air. very unsafe areas. loud and very bad for health on people that work there.
bad,"Falta de lideres/gestores na empresa é visível, há apenas gerentes/diretores que se preocupam com o seu resultado (bônus) não se preocupando em desenvolver equipe eficientes, as promoções ocorre conforme o QI, não valorizando capacitação do profissional. Alem da alta valorização de profissionais estrangeiros (que desconhecem o sistema/normas de trabalho no Brasil)."
bad,A fuir certe le salaire est bien mais formation trop courte et bâclé pour le poste. A peine arrivé il faut tout  connaître c'est chacun pour soi aucun esprit d'équipe avec des horaires de dingue surtout en interim plus de vie perso boss jusqu'a 50h par semaine et a peine 24h de repos. Aucune reconnaissance pour son personel
bad,Partes da liderança mal qualificado sem experiência no trabalho de cada setor falta de visão para escolher líderes falta de comunicação aos colaboradores
bad,"Owens Illinois provides many opportunities for learning new systems and technologies.  Management is very safety focused, but I witnessed several injuries and 1 fatality over my career with Owens and sustained chronic poor health during this time.  "
bad,Buen ambiente de trabajo se respetan dias festivos sus horarios son muy complicados
bad,Absolutely no training culture. You are thrown on a line or machine and expected to know what to do. If it were not for the other operators taking time away from their job to help you would have to learn it on your own and are bound to have problems. The one so-called training instructor constantly rolls her eyes when you ask her a question.  No personality what so ever.  The supervisors are expecting people to do a job who have had little to no training. Starting pay and benefits are good but between poor training and rotating shifts I and others are already looking for other employment opportunities.
bad,nessa empresa o dificíl ter momentos de lazer com a familia
bad,"Very bad work life balance. It seems that most everything is negative in tone and nature. There is little teamwork, people work in silo's for self preservation."
bad,"I was an engineering Co-Op for a year. During this time i had 3 different bosses. I also got to witness a mass firing right before Christmas. They seemed to treat people like commodities, for this reason i did not pursue a career."
bad,"Les journées de travail s'étirent et votre équilibre vie professionnelle et familiale en est affecté. Milieu malsain, raciste, malpropre, ou l'harcèlement et l'inéquité est chose commune et toléré par la haute direction. La haute direction de l'usine manque de leadership et incapable d'insuffler le changement et les mauvaises habitudes perdurent. Comme l'usine est centenaire, une large proportion des superviseurs n'ont aucune scolarité et de ce fait sont parfois les plus résistants aux changements et adoptent des attitudes de rustres sexistes. La culture qualité est totalement absente et peu supportée par les têtes dirigeantes de l'usine."
bad,The management structure has had several major restructurings in the past two years. Each time job security takes a hit. What use to be a fairly stable job has become a day by day uncertainty.
bad,"Great people but mismatch of management objectives. Just not a place for someone straight out of college, may be better fit for someone with several years of experience."
bad,"O-I is undergoing a transformation but there is a deep culture driving a lack of empowerment, grossly distorted promotion policies, & lack of training"
bad,The company has 80 plants world wide.  The Atlanta plant is one of the older sites and it is being determined if the site will close.  A great deal of the equipment is older and needs to be replaced.
bad,Owens might be the perfect swing shift job for the right person just not me.
bad,This is not a company for someone like myself
bad,"I liked the work there, very easy going work ethic. Running the automated machine wasnt hard to learn. The management wasnt to good due to the fact that they never communicated things going on with the company."
bad,The schedule is garbage. The only good thing about this place is the pay                       You work seven days a week on a rotating schedule. Graveyard is the worse
bad,muy mala administración corren ala gente que tiene bien puesta la camiseta y se quedan con puro barbero
bad,12 hour shifts of fast passed work. Supervisor snaps easily and the palletizer job can be stressful.
bad,Not as much job security as I had thought. Pays well with good benefits. Hard to find another job when the layoff comes. Management thinks it’s just temporary but I am looking for a new job.
bad,"Put a good amount of time in, and still out a job. Great pay, great benefits, some great leaders in management. Unhealthy work schedule. Everything seniority based. High school environment."
bad,A great company that is not managing people and culture to its full potential.
bad,I would not recommend this place for employment. The salary is great benefits good. Employees with 10 plus years and management makes the work environment hostile & harassing
good,"No período em que trabalhei na oi tive a oportunidade de estudar e me graduar em engenharia de produção, após formado fui demitido pois não havia oportunidade para minha pessoa na empresa. E não enxergaram com bons olhos minha permanência na mesma."
good,"Rotating shifts are the worst, job is easy, but there’s no room for advancement. Everything is by seniority and they lay the lowest off almost every year now. Management is all over the place and the slackers seem to be rewarded, while the hard workers get walked all over. All and all if they would just get rid of the rotating shift it really wouldn’t be a bad place to work for. Which I don’t see why they wouldn’t change this it seems like all the reviews say this but no one in this company cares to make their employees happy. Go down the seniority list like they do with everything else it’s really not that hard. They changed it to straight shifts for the mechanics and we are all in the same Union?! What’s the deal???"
good,"La Valoración se ve reflejada solo en las responsabilidades.Y los premios agregados por la empresa no van enfocados en resultados tangibles. Se pagan por simpatía y no por resultados."
good,"They hired Accenture because several of the Managers had worked for Accenture before.  "
good,"The company is always stating it’s close to closing our plant. We have to do more to keep the doors open, but when you need parts to fix a machine. There is no money or we can’t get that part. This culture has lead to just about every machine pieced together and barley running. The last year management has tried to get a pm system running but with out parts and time to rebuild equipment there is really no point."
good,The company was ok. My boss was good guy. They had me work on a project where they bought out another company and they needed me to get all the software and verify it
good,Good pay with bad hours and bad work environment.  Don't work here unless you have to.  Rotating weekly shift and constant call ins.
good,"Empresa de pequeno porte em assessoria de imprensa. Ambiente de muito aprendizado, porém de pouco reconhecimento."
good,"Work 8 hour shift face pace job, keeps you busy and I learn how glass is made. Management was not that great at listen to employee suggestion about how job could be ran better.I enjoy my co-workers they understood the team work. When people didn't come to work and pick up the slack do more than one job at time. My days off!"
good,I worked for Owen-Illinois for nearly 10 years. You'll more than likely work swing shift as day turn jobs are few and far between and it doesn't go by seniority to get there in some departments even though it's union. Company does what they want regardless of Local Agreements with the Union. Managment constantly changes and the rules and business practices change with them. It's hard to see your family when your either working or sleeping all the time. Benefits and pay are great if you're willing to trade your life for it. I enjoyed working on the equipment and the regular people you work with on the floor.
good,Terminated for violation of attendance policy due to diagnosed disease ( Valley Fever ) after 8 years of being an exemplary employee. Very unhappy with MGMT and Union persons involved.
good,"work unsupervised , with out breaks at time ,meeting production goal, rotation shifts change to short ,, must work week end s  and holidays , working in heat at time above 100 degrees with no air conditioning units working."
good,Typische werkdag fouten in flessen zoeken en het transport draaiend houden.
good,"Traveled and worked in the hot end for 13 years than bid into the Mill and lathe side.  Worked there for 13 more years on cnc and manual mill, griders and lathes.  Worked on quality issues for 6 years with extensive blueprint reading and micrometer use."
good,"Easy, but repetitive and not a lot of chances to get promoted. Starting pay is decent, but won't increase much after that. Swing shift every week so you have to rotate during work including graveyard, this is mandatory."
good,Empresa boa para iniciar no mercado de trabalho. tt
good,"Empresa muito boa, mediante as parâmetros nacionais."
good,Managed  shift operations on day to day manufacturing and safety guidelines for liquor bottles for the largest liquor companies in the United States as well of overseas.
good,"Very high pace, and very challenging, which is what keeps me coming back!"
good,"A Owens é uma enorme empresa, feita de pessoas super capacitadas, ambiente aberto e descontraído. Sempre disposta a deixar o funcionário a aprender e crescer, pra mim foi uma grande escola, onde aprendi muita coisa, tanto no nível profissional quanto no pessoal."
good,"This was a nice place to work for and always busy. I was a temp and knew I would not be hired on, I was sent to get a job done and that's what I did. The hardest part is to get everyone to work as a team, I learned to stay on top of thing or they would fall through the cracks fast."
good,Otima Empresa com bons beneficios inclusive estendido a familiares diretos sem carencia.
good,"Facility Closed down several years after left organization.  However, during my time there, it was a good company to work."
good,"everything is falling apart, the stress to keep up is damaging."
good,"Rotating can be time consuming no real work/life balance, pay is good for entry level. room for advancement. Hardest part of the job is rotating a 7 day work week getting one day off then going graveyard."
good,Uma boa empresa com ótimos benefícios .porém com alguns problemas como promoção e o calor ecessivel .
good,"Galera,dinâmica ."
good,"Gestores da empresa,embora muitos competentes,mais com pouco nível de reconhecimento, e assim as chances de progredir dentro da empresa,são mínimas."
good,"worked on hydraulics neumatics, i was a shift mechanic liked my work, but got a better job"
good,"O-I was the first company that I worked for in private industry. I learned a lot about the processes and logistics of managing a large manufacturing operation. The business culture at the corporate office was pleasant and friendly, but opportunities for advancement were limited. The company produced good products."
good,"empresa boa ,com benefícios muito bons uma carga no trabalho pesada COM MUITA SOBRE CARGA, mas com salarios e benificios  acima do mercado."
good,Good company that balances work and home life. Doesn't have a formal career development program. Investment in employees is average. Overall good company to work for.
good,"A empresa em si é ótima, pois é de grande porte e oferece grandes aprendizados. Porém, não há organização e planejamento, as demandas são sempre urgentes  e prioritárias, não há eficiência em solucionar o problema desde sua causa raíz. "
good,"O trabalho exige muito do físico e de concentração. Existe muita possibilidade de aprendizado, em diversas vertentes, não só no sentido técnico e operacional, mas também nas relações humanas, pois o trabalho em equipe exige isso. Percebo isso através do meu próprio relacionamento com colegas, que muitas vezes ultrapassa o campo profissional, pois há uma convivência e uma vivência diária tão próxima e tão integrada, que é impossível não surgir uma amizade ou, quando não, ao menos um respeito mútuo pelo que cada um é e se esforça para ser. Quanto às lideranças, tenho muito o que agradecer por todos que me deram a oportunidade de mostrar minha capacidade, de desenvolvê-las e de colocar em prática também, por vezes, a minha própria metodologia, podendo contribuir de forma positiva para o melhoramento do trabalho. Só desejo que outras pessoas também tenham essa oportunidade, com mais frequência e efetividade."
good,"OI is a good place to make good money if you are single and plan on staying that way, or if your kids are grown. But if you have young children or are beginning a marriage, it is the worst. They rotate your schedule weekly, and 90% of the time you work on the weekends. So forget about your social life. their ""weekend"" is really a gap of only 48 hours, literally, oh and by the way on a new schedule, like from swing to graveyards. this is detrimental to your health and biological clock, not to mention the lack of sleep puts you in a bad mood all the time. Like most other places, supervisors favor kiss ashes, they give the brown nosers the jobs they want, and give the dirtier jobs to people they don't like. There is absolutely no training, and most senior employees don't want to show you anything."
good,"Really good workplace, pay and benefits are great but you are always going to be worried about job security. The latest layoff was in November of 2019."
good,"Bonne entreprise ou faire ces débuts. Seul couac, le fazit que les intérimaires soit pris et jeté sans raison."
good,"Ambiente bom"
good,"O-I provides it's employees a good working environment. There are good career development opportunities in Europe and globally."
good,"This is a very common aspect of work overload. Due to turn overs and voluntary separations, positions are not quickly filled, thus requiring other employees to cover the gap. This at times can go for months or years. This creates work overload and to an extent inefficiency."
good,"Good place to work if you don’t mind giving up your free time. In my role the phone rang all hours of the day and night and had to be answered.  We were compensated for our time, but cost too much in my personal life."
good,Working for a help desk is entry level IT but overall the work environment was nice and typically business casual.  Nearly all the staff were friendly and helpful
good,"Things are stressful in IT due to a lot of outsourcing in the past few years. A lot of IT people are in Poland, so they can't be reached after 10-11am."
good,"El proceso de selección está bien elaborado"
good,"I worked there around 6 years. I got really good pay, but the work was hard, conditions are so HOT, working with glass for the whole shift. Managers and coworkers did not treat me very well, I felt like I didn't fit in, but I dealt with it because it was great pay."
good,Una industria no muy difundida la del vidrio por no haber muchas plantas de este tipo en nuestro país. La verdad que una gran experiencia y muchos conocimientos nuevos.
good,"Ik heb er met veel plezier gewerkt voor bijna 35jaar, good contact met Hoger Kader en met Collega's"
good,"I been working here for 2 weeks already and let me tell you, the job and pay is great. The only negative thing I  have about this company is that management doesnt have  good Communication with the new employees. What I mean about that is that I have to go ask what time Im coming in and what time i come out mostly everyday. thats all . overall the company is great"
good,"Ótima empresa com horários flexíveis."
good,"Rotating shift was a pain for the system to adapt to, caused problems at home. Great opportunities to become involved in R&D projects with corporate engineers in process development of proprietary processes in the plastics industry."
good,"Day to Day tasks involved setting up machines to handle different size and shaped bottles. under strict time scales to complete the job and to do maintenance."
good,worked with plastic injection parts and molding. separated parts from scrap and then packaged it according to order.
good,"Working in the corporate offices as well as the manufacturing facilities I was able to see the entire organization and get a understanding of the majority of stakeholders and viewpoints.While, O-I is a great company that offers a quality product, the recent changes in leadership and structure however have exposed an inability or unwillingness to develop talent and successors. Career paths are more limited due to to recent changes and not more. I enjoy the ability I have everyday to see a finished product being created and to know that I had a hand in ensuring that it is ready for a customer. I enjoy the customer interactions and my role in ensuring that my customers are able to use my product in their processes without problems. The most difficult part of the job is being taken away from it to fill in in other areas."
good,"não tinha equipe,parte mais agradavel os treinamentos que era dados por nos ou seja o recolhecimento dos colaboradores"
good,"Dès les premiers jours, vous ressentez la passion du verre autour de vous et petit à petit vous devenez un des ses ambassadeurs ! C'est cette passion qui porte le groupe aux résultats obtenus malgré un marché en décroissance et une concurrence féroce des autres acteurs mais aussi des autres matériaux."
good,Good place to work. The management that I worked with was very inexperienced and would change almost every 3 months. The one manager that was consistent lacked management skills and could not Handel busy work.
good,Work place is friendly and management is kind and understanding. Yet the corporate side is in transition and jobs are not safe.
good,"OI has been a company in transition for past 10 years and like anything else, goes through cycles of ups and downs. The new CEO is will be attempting to rejuvenate the culture and operations. The company recently implemented SAP and is learning to work with this complicated and often cumbersome system. The younger employees will excel with this and benefit greatly from the experience."
good,"A good company with very little potential to grow, and very little to learn and grow while needing a college degree to get the job. Co-workers are good, management needs better communications skills. If you like to clean floors and very dusty equipment in a hot environment then this is the job for you."
good,"Owens Illinois do Brasil é uma empresa multinacional muito agradável de se trabalhar , co muitas pessoas proativas ."
good,ran the machine repair shop over seen all job changes.made shore hot end had the parts needed to do their job.management great to work with .co-workers good to work with .making sur all shifts were covered had parts to work with working with my guys in shop and on floor great bunch of guys
good,"(speaking from an interns perspective) The people outside of my department were nice and seemed to call o-i home since many have been there for over 10 years. O-i has great pay and competitive benefits and good work life balance. "
good,Met plezier gewerkt als procesoperator bij de glasfabriek
good,"With any big corporation, you work. If you don’t, you get attention. So those who worked, did well. Those who did not, well, you know."
good,"Atendeu minhas expectativas para uma multinacional, porem como toda empresa tem seus pontos fracos e fortes. "
good,"Well established, large company. Experience is dependent upon your supervisor and team. Lots of internal movement with Regional Management and a new CEO. Company changed a lot over the time I was there in positive way but the trickle down takes a while. Company is still working on diversity at the top."
good,"A emrpresa preserva um ambiente de trabalho agradável, com um  excelente relacionamento interpessoal e entre áreas distintas."
good,Aprendi muito em quanto permaneci na empresa mais fui dispensado  por conta da crise no senário mundial onde dispensou as vendas e com isso a produção e ocorreu vários cortes no quadro de funcionários o lamentável é a não recontratação de funcionários que já passou pela empresa.
good,"Overall was a good job. My job as a Office Assistant OH& S Management and Multi Skilled Operator in O-I; allowed me to do a very good process of settlement in Australia at the same time allowed me to discover new abilities and skills that I didn’t know that I had, and overall it was an experience that served to prove to myself that there is nothing that I can achieve."
good,"I used to have ownership and pride in my position, then upper management decided to make an organizational change in the manufacturing plants. The majority of the workers were forced to begin working rotating shifts, and cause a lot of people to have issues with their work life balance. Upper management is not engaged in what they ask the mid level management to do for the company."
good,"I used to run a G&L milling machine, a Cim-X tape reading mill a manual horizontal mill and a Fadal, CNC vertical boring mill. There I did a bit of programing and fixture design."
good,I enjoyed the years I worked  with Owen-Illinois.  I was very beneficial for me as well as my family.  I don't mind shift work so I was good with my schedule.
good,Un manager disponible lors du stage et de la réalisation du projet tuteuré en entreprise.
good,"satisfactory"
good,"The work culture was fabulous when I first worked there. Shuffled Supervisors constantly, Promotions were only given to employees that were favored or had to switch positions. Layoffs every year."
good,"Dia típico de trabalho com muitos problemas operacionias, criticos, antigos, graves, mas com cultura forte e não querem resolver;"
good,"it was a very fast work because the managers ask a number of productivity that employees must reach every day, the pay was good and they paid vacation"
good,"The location at which I worked was not a family friendly place to work.  The hours were long and the expectation was for everyone to do the same job, not the job for which they were hired."
good,"Trabalhar nessa empresa foi uma das melhores épocas da minha vida, aprendi muito nessa empresa."
good,Una empresa privada que fue expropiada por el gobierno Venezolano
good,"Good workplace culture"
good,plant closure. was a good job but you can't work if the place is shut down
good,"Good Benefits and pay. Long hours on call 24/7. not a clean environment. Union workers, training could be better,  good location , no commuting. well established"
good,"Mixed bag of coworkers, good and bad. Not unlike many corporations. Frantic changes take place constantly and many people are difficult to trust what their agenda is in the midst of turmoil."
good,"They pay very well and have amazing benefits.  It is a union job so there is alot of perks. The hours are horible though,  rotating shifts and 7 day work weeks."
good,Worked swing shift at a bottle manufacturing building for the summer. Was a selector of bottles and managed machines on the job site. Also packaged bottles and had to make inventory checks and keep track of packaging.
good,"Overall O-I was a good place to work. aside from the rotating shifts it was great.That was pretty much my only issue, There's racism, favoritism, and nepotism but I've found that to be present in every workplace whether it's admitted or not.I had to leave based on family issues that were impossible to overcome based on the rotating shift but they were good to me and I have very few unkind words for my O-I experience."
good,"Empresa com excelentes benefícios, uma empresa multinacional com mais 80 fabricas espalhadas pelo mundo, excelentes colaboradores."
good,"I learned how to make glass,check quality, measures and especifications, a lot of good co-workers and few good managements, and the hardest part of my job it was don't have good tools to do my work (always said no money to buy) and the most enjoyable part of my job, when I saw the bottles (good bottles) in the stores or winery full of liquid and ready to sale"
good,O-I has been a great place for me. They have treated me fairly and has as much overtime as you can handle. There was always something that needed to be done.
good,"Not terribly fun to work in, but paid well. It was manual labor which should say it all. Company provides opportunities for extra hours on top of the already 40 minimum work weeks."
good,Interessante empresa para aprender do trabalho em campo e estar em contato com o pessoal.
good,Good working environment. Decent pay. Work with lots of talented people. Colleagues are nice and easy to work with. Good place to begin your career.
good,"I began as a weekend warrior doing back ups off of an O/S 390 mainframe. I began to rapidly move from 3rd's on the weekend, to 3rd's on the weekdays, to 2nd shift and then on 1st shift. I had trained and supervised 4 of the department resources, updated/revised the department documents, cut checks that were mailed regularly, sent out briefing reports and eventually helped decommission over 100+ boxes and installed server more during the Data Migration and the initial setup of SAP that replaced the old M/F. The only problem was that I was a contractor, I was only supposed to work there six years, which in the end lasted over six! But, I could not seem to wiggle into the company which has been my biggest disappointment as an adult."
good,"Uma empresa que há uma grande diversidade de tarefas a serem executadas possibilitando o crescimento técnico do funcionário , que mantem o colaborador sempre habituado a trabalhar em equipe para o bom funcionamento de todo o ambiente fabril."
good,a empresa oferece um bom ambiente de trabalho e também tem ótimos profissionais.
good,En la etapa de implementación de SAP se aprendió mucho ya que la migración permite incrementar conocimientos y poder liderar un equipo.
good,Hardest part is the rotating shifts. Typical hours work is 7 with a paid lunch time. The hardest part is to repair down machines as fast as possible.
good,"Work constantly changes depending on a number of factors (which, as a matter of fact, is good!) Sorting, packaging/repackaging, QC and cleanup."
good,"E uma ótima empresa que se se preocupa com os funcionários oferece treinamento, palestras, reuniões estrategias  visando a segurança dos processos industriais procurando principalmente à aplicação dos 5S dentro de determinadas condições."
good,Muito boa empresa. precisa investir mais nas pessoas que trabalham  no dia a dia para o desenvolvimento da empresa.
good,"Lo mas valioso de esta empresa es el capital humano, tiene gente capaz y entregada la cual hace el trabajo con gusto y entusiasmo a pesar de su deficiente administración; fue un placer colaborar con la gente de producción."
good,"Great place to work, some managers stay too long and should have retired long ago.  CEO trying to improve culture and moral and doing a pretty good job!  Hourly work force varies by plant, but overall committed to making a quality product.  Too many executive overhead positions - could be seriously stream-lined from corporate management perspective and put some positions back into the plants."
good,"They are doing a lot of shifting groups and responsibilities around between regions.  Glass as a commodity is not as popular and they are trying different things to make it work again.  The managers and co-workers I have had were good, but I am less comfortable about the higher level management."
good,"Empresa con buena tecnologia donde se aprende bastante y adquiere conocimientos relacionados a la carrera en las diferentes areas de trabajo."
good,"Empresa boa para trabalhar, muito dinâmica, bons benefícios, boa estrutura organizacional, boa localização, ambiente de trabalho agradável."
good,"It's a good paying job that is fairly secure. Major down side is 7day rotating shift. The management isn't the greatest, there is a real lack of communication and little regard for the union."
good,"I worked at O-I 1972 -1976, Juggling work & college. Working there starting as a packer leaving as a Y110 operator. It was hot in summer, you couldn't have ac because the machines were heated to melt plastic beads to blow or injection molded bottles. Great group of fellow workers about the best I ever worked with. By far better than any office I've been in. Of course you had a couple of rats, like all companies have, untrustworthy garbage of society. We socialized after work and played sports outside on the property. Pay was alright at the time, benefits were good, pension plan. Then in the early 1980's the plant closed. I'm looking fro workers that were there in the early 1970's . I now like just down the street from the plant. Small World."
good,"Ce stage au sein d'un service Ressources Humaines m'a permis de découvrir de nombreuses choses: "
good,You come in do your job and you go home. The management team treats you with respect. You work with people who has a lot of knowledge about there job. The hardest thing when work up on platforms is the stairs. You are constantly going up and down them all shift. In closing I say again it is a great place to work.
good,Rotating shifts with excellent compensation as an hourly employee paid holidays and excellent OT pay. Opporunity for advancement was good except to a salary position.
good,"muito trabalho"
good,"Working at OI was great, but they closed the plant I worked at. I miss it everyday!"
good,"Empresa boa para trabalhar e ambiente agradável."
good,I worked there for almost 33 years. It was a good paying job for our community. There wasn't much competition for jobs because it was the largest private employer in our county. They deciced to close our plant in 2010.
good,"I worked in warehousing. The job demanded attention to details. Shipping docks can be a busy congested area , therefor safety was always first on your mind. Job required use of RF scanning and barcodes.I assisted in inventory control and cycle counts regularly to maintain correct inventory totals."
good,drove a forklift all day. management was fair. the hardest part of the job was working rotating shifts. the good part was meeting new people and friends. I learned computer skills.
good,"•	Inspection of quality of finalized products with appropriate documentation of detailed results "
good,"Environnement de travail agréable, quotidien intéressant"
good,"Devido ao maquinário antigo a manutenção tinha que ser bem executada para que não houvesse quebra ou disperdício de material."
good,everyone was friendly and easy to work with. There were many different technical challenges. It was a great way to gain experience in the IT industry.
good,Excellent company to work for.  Good opportunity for growth. Diversity from different parts of the world in Miami and Perrysburg.  Co-workers are friendly and management as well.
good,A typical day at work is hot with a lot to do. i learned how to run the packers and carton machines my coworkers are nice and most will help you if needed the hardest part of my job is the swing shift
good,"Movimentado e espontanio"
good,"A empresa Owens Illinois é um boa empresa, ao meu ponto de vista tem muito melhorar , mas está caminhando para isso."
good,"Agitado, Como arquivar, atualizar CTPS, cálculos de ponto, como atender um colaborador bem. Meus colegas de trabalhos são muito profissionais no que fazem, atender os colaboradores da produção, atualizar CTPS."
good,"Iniciava meu dia tomando pé do que estava acontecendo nas unidades, ocorrência de acidentes, pendências, necessidades e tarefas programadas."
good,"Ótima Organização"
good,"Uma empresa multinacional na vidreira, de grande porte, com vários tipos de risco. Funciona com uma escola de aprendizagem, pois os riscos encontrados dentro da empresa, são riscos pertinentes a todas as áreas industriais e até no que condiz com a área administrativa. Infelizmente por não haver vaga no setor de segurança fui obrigado a sair, mas, me deu um vasta experiência que vou carregar por toda a vida. Uma equipe integrada com técnicos experientes no ramo e inclusive na própria empresa dos 4 técnicos o mais novo de empresa tem 10 anos. A parte mais difícil, a luta incessante a espera de uma vaga que infelizmente não veio, a parte agradável, o entrosamento, colegas de setor, colegas das várias áreas dentro da empresa, tudo era contornado com diplomacia e diálogo."
good,The company is struggling to change its culture from top down driven to empowerment. Overall good place to work if you are in a plant that serves a growth area. ie. Food or liquor.
good,People at O-I are good to work with and are willing to help.  A great deal of support is provided by corporate leadership to help improve operations and the overall health of the organization.
good,Managers have a hard time communicating with each other or with the employees .. which can be very frustrating at times.. other than that not a bad place to work and they pay well
good,"El trabajo en planta es exigente, 24 horas 7 días a la semana."
good,I am considering leaving due to the fact you have to work all 3 shifts and you can't enjoy your life and you are rarely off on the wkend.  The pay is excellent but not always worth it.
good,"Bom relacionamento, atividade monitorada por superiores da área e aproveitamento com bom resultado."
good,"Empresa seria, responsable. Ambiente de trabajo respetuoso y colaborativo. En planta el ritmo de trabajo es exigente y de alta demanda, exige bastante de las personas."
good,"Overall they are sincere hardworking people.  The challenges they face are not trivial.  They live in a hugely competitive world.  As usual with most big corporations, the corporate people tend to be thinkers and planners.  The operational people (plant level) tend to be those with a bias for doing and acting quickly.  The plant level is fast-paced due to end-to-end, connected, continuous processing.  There is little tolerance for waiting when anything breaks.  Hold on to your hat at the plant level."
good,"Ótima empresa, ambiente agradável .se preoculpa com o bem estar dos seus funcionários!!!"
good,"Ótimo ambiente de trabalho, coordenação presente, com bons benefícios."

good,Great place to advance your career with relocation. Long work days and on call 24/7. Great work culture. Learned how to lead people. Willing to teach and train.
good,Tedious and repetitive work. Housekeeping duties and machine maintenance required on all machinces in my work area. Always was busy in bulk operations or carton assembly work. Kept assembly line full of product and always operable; for case packer operations.
good,"Depending on the department, the work environment is very collaborative.  Ideas are heard and employees supported.  If you work on the Global Service Desk, expect different treatment.  That team has a lead that is more interested in moving up then the people on the team.  If you are one of the ones that are liked, you will be treated well."
good,"Learned an amazing amount about the glass manufacturing process."
good,"the job suited me as it could be quite challenging and physical at times. and although there was the usual basic duties and the day to day running could be mundane you never new what to expect as due to the nature of working on a machine manufacturing glassware running nonstop, things could change in an instant. i have never liked the idea of a desk job and like to able to use my initiative to problem solve. the factory ran on a culture of continual improvement, which, in my opinion is the only way a business can survive. most of the fellow workers were good to work with. as in any place, work or otherwise there were a few that were hard to get along with. it was said to see a high turn over in management and staff towards the end due to the gfc and subsequent downturn of the wine export market which was our mainstay.the resulting closure of machines from a peak of 6 down to two when i was retrench led to an atmosphere of unease and did bring out some nasty characteristics in a minority of people. which is understandable.but on the whole it was the best job i ever had for a number of reasons and the pay was good too."
good,"A typical day at work began with the running of bottle samples through various machines in order to assess machine functionality. Each sample is ran three times on an hourly basis, for a total of 36 times per shift. The rest of the shift was spent monitoring the lines for jam ups, assessing bottles for critical defects as well has keeping the work environment clean and safe. Occasionally My job required me to hand package glass ware, palletize cartons as well as feed ware and cartons onto the conveyor belt. "
good,"Salary is above average. Working conditions are fair - good. Management fair, and approachable. Room for advancement is limited, due to unionized structure."
good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho, cooperação entre os funcionários e a gerência."

good,Demontrar  nas atividades diversas  a experiência adquirida no setores informados tendo  a facilidades de aprender e executar; aprendendo a ter confiabilidade nas atividades exigidas conforme as normas e procedimento de segurança e meio ambiente garantindo  um trabalho eficiente .
good,"Learned a lot there, big plant  lots of different jobs to do. Management was good to us, understanding and quick to fix issues. What was tough was that the plant had a rotating shift schedule every week we rotated."

good,"No dia-a-dia o trabalho é bem produtivo, aprendi a trabalhar em equipe. A gerência era compreensiva com todos, o difícil era suportar o calor em dias quentes. Agradável foi a aprendizagem em cada etapa que passei."
good,"I enjoyed this job. I meet many interesting people, saw many interesting businesses, worked on fun projects and learn plenty in doing it all."
good,I enjoyed working for this company. The working conditions are hot in the summer but that is with any manufacturing job. I have been retired for 2 years so i am unsure how it is now.
good,2 ans d’alternance chez O-I à Vergeze. Diverses missions réalisées spécialement en sécurité du personnel. Bonne embuante dans le personnel. Je recommande!
good,Descent pay and benefits. Swing shift schedule not the greatest.Good place to work though. I have worked at a lot worse places for less money. So if you can handle rotating 1st thru 3rd shifts you can handle working there.
good,"Great team environment , really enjoyed working with external customer. Enjoyed managing different sites with slightly different requirements. Learnt my LSS skilled through this company."
good,In my position I am responsible for production. The people I have on my crew are team players. I never have any issues with anyone performing a task they are expected to perform.
good,"Buen ambiente entre compañeros y la gerencia."
good,"*Aprender constantemente."
good,"I have expanded my experience and skills throughout the many years of working for the company."
good,"This company offers a wide range of interests for engineering students from mechanical, chemical to material engineering. The group I worked with in the glass science R&D department took their time to make sure I knew not only what I was doing but why. They were always willing to lend me a hand and let me think on my own. I was able to be creative with learning about colors in glass and also held responsible for a lot of lab work and organization. I would recommend this position to any student even slightly interested in the glass industry!"
good,"Trabalhei na área administrativa,   administravamos a entrada e saída dos produtos , diretamente da parte de qualidade da empresa.Prestava atendimento a clientes de fora .Empresa Multi-Nacional"

good,"While working for OI I had the opportunity to work with multiple teams, learn from experts in engineering, design and manufacturing, and at some points meet our Executives. Typical days were the average 8-5 with friendly interaction among coworkers."
good,OI is a global glass container manufacturer. It was always interesting work since you never knew if you would be interacting with domestic or international co-workers on any given day.
good,Empresa de Grande Porte e era muito resistente a mudanças onde a planta de Fortaleza não era tão bem assistida tanto que fechou.

good,"good company to work for, great co-workers, team players, management easy to talk to, great benefits, 8 and 12 hr shifts, job training."
good,"This job was plain and simply controlled chaos. No sooner did you clock in and the next thing you knew, it was time to clock out. It did not matter whether you worked 7-3, 3-11, or 11-7, fast, fast, fast. We worked all 3 shifts...11-7 for 5 days, then 2 days off...3-11 for 5 days, then 1 day off....Then 7-3 for 5 days, then 2 days off. No one liked 7-3, that was when all of management would try to run things their way all at once and things never went smoothly like 2nd and 3rd shift did."
good,Fast paced work environment with supportive coworkers and professional guidance and support from management.
good,"Um dia de trabalho bem intenso , repleto de decisões , reunião , acompanhamentos , contato com cliente, muita descontração com as equipes , a gerência muito proxima do""chão de fábrica"" e decisões diárias , por se tratar de um ambiente insalubre a parte fisica é constantemente exigida bem como pressão oriunda do procsso produtivo,porém é compensada com um grupo de pessoas e também instalações agradáveis para descontrair e confraternizar"

I work a straight 8 hours and no mandatory o.t. It is rotating shifts, which is the toughest part of the job. I receive my schedule for the whole year in advance. I can plan out other activities accordingly. My supervisor is great at approving  day off requests on work days. I like it here. It is steady to fast paced. My work day goes by fast. My warehouse co-workers are easy to get along with."

good,"Muito boa. Dará melhor visibilidade. "
good,Owens Illinois is a very dangerous job. Making sure you are hydrated and constantly drinking water is the key to surviving in such hot conditions. All of my co workers were very nice and supportive. Swing shifts are not as bad as people make them out to be. Once you get the hang of them your body can adjust. The only negative thing about Owens Illinois is their HR representative.
good,"You work a swing shift, so 5 days on day shift, then 5 on midnights, and 5 on afternoons so your sleeping schedule is never good. There is almost always unlimited overtime."

I assisted the facilities in management of their Health and Safety Programs as well as in charge of the Workers Compensation in those same facilities.  My co-workers were great;  because I was with the company for so long my working relationships were exceptional.  "
good,A typical day at OI was busy with lots of project to do and customers to take care of. I learned to understand other people's priorities and to listen and validate other's views. The management were leaders and mentors more than simple boss. I developed much respect for them as real people and professionals. My co-workers were helpful and very resourceful. They knew their job really well. The hardest part of my job it was to keep up with that excellence as an entry level engineer. I learned a lot but I wanted to be more productive and contribute more to the company in my area. The most enjoyable part of my job was to deal with the co-workers and the sense of family and belonging inside the company.
