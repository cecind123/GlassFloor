rating,review
bad,Rank stacking destroys morale and turns all employees against one another. Completely worthless employees stab each other in the back every chance they get. Look else where.
bad,"A thoroughly trying time working in a very unpleasant environment, yet I am very grateful for my experience as it taught me the warning signs to look out for in a job."
bad,My time here was brief as I am glad it was the worst batch of people and ran organization I've been apart of. I would never recommend anyone to work here or do business here
bad,Managers were not good the company has a whole horribly run managers played favorites and never promoted anyone unless they were personal friends with them.
bad,Bad company they dont care about their employees. They are not flexible. They treat us like robots and dont appreciate us like human beings. They need to work on that.
bad,Within the first thirty days of employment it became very clear that the management is self serving and not concerned with the overall prosperity of the company or its employees. Many of the floor management share employee personal information with subordinates and make derrogatory comments regarding work performance of lower performing employees. The management techniques are old school and completely ineffective.
bad,The overall structure lacks the ability to adapt to individual who have strong ideas related to change.  It is uncommon for the knowledge of a single person with the support of the team to drive a solution without senior level leader using race and gender as their primary decision factor.
bad,"If you want to be another number and not a person, go for it. Managers will not help you and overall you have to just put your head down and carry on. Worst company I ever worked for."
bad,"Well this is a challenging environment, the customer expects a solution which was rarely if ever achievable within the call time guidelines the only positive being there was no sales targets like most of the modern day customer service jobs you basically spent 2 minutes fobbing them off after they have spent at least 30 minutes in a hold queue"
bad,"Not the same place it was early on, I don't have anything good to say about te previous management; maybe FiServ will be better.  Most people I knew there have left"
bad,People are constantly quitting for good reason. Mandatory overtime is often dropped on you last minute... or at least was when I was there. High stress for low pay.
bad,when I worked at first data I was not able to fully get into the flow of things because a week after training I had to take a break for my grandfathers funeral. when I came back I struggled to take the calls and spoke to my supervisor several times about receiving additional training to catch up but it never happened and my performance suffered. not long after I had to start university and the result to work around my time table was shorter breaks. I was later let go without notice escorted outside of the building to wait in the winter while it rained
bad,"this is not a role for everyone, management is poor and no room for career progression. Many unrealistic targets to meet. however they have increased the salary"
bad,It was a typical office environment.  Were not big on work life balance.  Not much opportunity for growth or inclusion.  Much uncertainty and constant lay offs and change of Management.  Not allowing for a sense of stability
bad,"Management say they have your back and the next minute they push you under the bus. Lie too much, no one is honest. No promotion within. Always hiring less qualified people. Would give a rate of negative 5, but this does not allow it. Looking to get out of here ASAP"
bad,"I was one of the best at the collections department but was unfairly treated. Racist,horrible managers who don't care. You are just a number.No work life balance. No progression until you get involves in office politics. I do not recommend. Horrible pay for all the targets you are expected to meet."
bad,"This a revolving door of employees and contractors. They dispose of people as if they were empty bottles of water....cold, emotionless and short sighted organization."
bad,"Just not a good company to work for. Great co workers to work with. Just went through to many managers ."
bad,"Move 20 minutes down the road and double your pay.  This place is horrible and always wants something for nothing."
bad,"It is a good company ,meets all the requirements"
bad,"Management is stuck in old ways. Aggressive environment. No opportunity for growth. They will replace you the first chance they get. If you are hourly you have to punch in and out, so your time is tracked down to the minute. Terrible work and home balance. Don’t waste your time lol."
bad,"First Data had extreme hours. No compensation. Gradually took away from the employees... laptops, cell phones and stopped many benefits...  I would not apply for a job here"
bad,"No job security, poor management, lack of advancement.  This is a cut-throat place to work, you can't trust anyone.  Instead of building the knowledge of tenured employees to advance them they by pass in favor of bringing in younger employees giving them the advancement opportunities"
bad,First Data is Horrible all around. There is no work life balance and they do not care about anyone besides the business needs. I do no recommend working there. I worked for Client Services.
bad,You are a number and a dollar sign.  They do not care about their employees.  They do not give proper raises.  If you get promoted from within you do not get adequate money for that promotion.
bad,Too bug and has too many alliances. Needs to work on it team more than a lll the other parties.would love to have more say in the day to day activities for the sales
bad,"Worst experience of my life, wouldn't wish on anyone. I have worked for multiple employers I have adored and have been a worthwhile experience, this was anything but that."
bad,The company is a good one to work for but not the best if you want career advancement. The culture is not the best as well. Some people are great to work with but management is a little political. advancement is on who you know basis and not what you know.
bad,Meetings to plan the Planning meetings.  Meetings to plan the Status meetings.  A CEO making millions who doesn't understand why the employees want a 401k.  91 Vice Presidents.  Need I say more?
bad,"Let go after 20 yrs, new mgmt every 6 months. They went from being close to the number 1 employer to starting at ground zero. Benefits declined greatly in 20 years. No 401 K matching, horrible insurance, and NO employee satisfaction."
bad,This is the worse job I ever had in my life. The management are all crooks and make the employees feel uncomfortable and try to bully them. Its a hostile environment. They all stick together and do not want to see you move up in the company. Good workers leave and have nothing to show for it.
bad,Managers have their favorites then pick on everyone else. Not fair and make for a hostile work environment. Would not recommend to my worst enemy to work here. My mental health has suffered from working there.
bad,Not a fun place to work. Management are too moody I work the night shift. They were moody because they were sleepy. They micro manage too much. If you need a job  because you are desperate this is the place. If you can find something better go for it. This is a warning.
bad,High turnover so in and out quick. No much care the for clients just there to do a job. Managers have favourites and don't have much control on the team
bad,"Verablly abused by merchants all day every day, dreaded going to work every day. When I was 9 months pregnant they fired me, couldn't pay me enough to work there again."
bad,Does provide some flexibility.  Need to be young to be promoted.  It's good to know someone who is a director or above for advancement.  No mentor or career growth.
bad,"This companies philosophy is to work the staff into exhaustion."
bad,Management lies to employees about various things.  Management does not purchase enough leads to allow employees to earn reasonable commissions and bonuses.
bad,"If you are looking for a high stress, low reward place to work First Data is perfect for you.  You are more of a number and a cost than an asset.  "
bad,Not a place to work especially if you a single person and have kids. You dont have the weekends off. Now i like that they have sick time. But they need to pay more money.
bad,Run very fast in the opposite direction!!!!! This is not a place for a normal person. Management is just horrible they do not care about you or anything else.
bad,Environment was cold and told them that and they did not care and let me go because I told them that. I feel they did not care about there employees and making them comfortable at work. They had favorites. Some Managers were nice though.
bad,"You are not compensated for the hours that you put in, nor are you rewarded for the hard work that you do. I found this company to be very stressful after working there a year."
bad,"worst place in the world!!! especially if you are an American citizen. they only hire you so that they can lay you off, keeping their eeo status. the management has no clue what they are doing from one shift to the next, there is no cohesiveness. The machinery is outdated & unsafe. yet when it has a system error or a major mechanical malfunction they still expect the workers to be able to get their numbers out. no excuses.no monthly upkeep is dine to keep. these multi million dollar machines that were outdated 20 yrs ago running smoothly.they award you these ""star awards"" for job well well done, but if you can get on line to collect them, they tax you for them!!! the 401k is non existant. they don't match. so whatever you put in is all you. But here's the kicker. it only get's put into the company! not into anything else. so you're investing your future in a bankrupt bound, yet again, company!!! trust no one  they all are all backstabbing freaks trying hard just to keep their jobs for just another day. i can't tell you how much happier and healthier i am now that i have quit. i was waiting until i could find something else, but sometimes you just have to say enough is enough! And i had had enough. do yourself a favor and stay as far away as far away as you can from this place."
bad,"The job was not offering much in the way of career advancement, although I received recognition via certificate for a great work performance, and several raises."
bad,"I currently work here and morale is really low, people leave left and right with no 2 weeks notice, managers are unwilling to fight for employees compensation and if you get and error it stays with you for ever so any time lay offs come around you are marked even if the mistake was years ago. So if you want 2 percent raises for life work here, also they stack employees against each other so even if a department has all perfect workers somebody is going to take last place regardless of work ethic and guess what that person is next out the door!!!"
bad,"I did not like this job. Everything was unorganized. Limited training, and then a week into working, they expected you to train new hires. Everyone was confused."
bad,"Very negative culture and work environment."
bad,A racially biased organization. supervisors are given unchecked authority to misrepresent truth. The work reviews are not reviewed by senior management for validity and not checked by authenticity.
bad,"I hate this job and will never recommend it to anyone. Terrible staff, terrible atmosphere, no room to grow. Worst job in the world.  Its a call center so don't expect much"
bad,Management horrible Horrible Horrible  Horrible.  No professionalism.  no respect.  Not a great place to work and would not recommend for anyone else.  They don't know how to treat employees
bad,"first Data is 20B (yes, BILLION) in debt.  They are struggling to climb out of debt and it's reflected in their treatment of employees;  layoffs, no bonuses, no raises, they even cut post-it notes."
bad,"Not a nice place to work , managers and seniors expect more aand more. I have also experienced verbal and physical abuse from a acting manager. Not a nice working environment"
bad,"The coworkers I had at this job were pretty nice.  My job consisted of night work, so when I was at the office there was not much to do except watch YouTube."
bad,"I would not recommend First Data to anyone wanting an IT job.  There is to much Gossip within the Ranks, and to much favoritism. First Data is a good place to get a idea of how to support User's over the phone but not a place to start a career."
bad,"Overworked underpaid. Always what can you do for me kind of place. Also, no room to grow. You could have as many certifications and degrees as you can imagine and nothing to show for it. They had rules preventing you from moving up. If you did move up still underpaid at tech positions that should pay double compared to averages for the job in that area. Call center job was brain numbingly dumb, overly repetitive and constant rude costumers. Timed lunch breaks to the minute and would be penalized for bathroom breaks that are not scheduled and yes I am an adult."
bad,Being chained to a desk by a phone was fun. Loved having to answer phones all day. It was fun troubleshooting credit card machines though. That was pretty fun.
bad,terrible place to work and would not recommend to anyone ever!! Do not ever ever ever work at this place or you will ruin your career! they have the worst management that is possible
bad,"I think its a great place to start a career in IT, however its very low paying high stress environment with inexperienced managers. If your looking for extra hours this may be your place to work."
bad,"First Data doesn't have a career goal, process improvement, you have to behave like a puppy to your management to continue. In my level found lot of process improvements & suggestions. No work life balance. Worked for 3 years and 6 months. NO night shift allowance or no compensation off where provided. Work from home option has been removed due to non-performers. It affected the real hard workers & valid reason as well."
bad,"The management, direction and development of employees was poor.  The investment in a stable poor of talent was nonexistent.  Not much to provide in terms of positive information."
bad,"The site director will be the downfall of this location. She is very unprofessional and makes emotional decisions. If she picks you to be on her bad list, watch out. She is very vindictive. It was a total nightmare working at this location."
bad,"First Data is a complete waste of time. I learned nothing. I had no work to do. Everyone there is a joke. Loud, high off drugs, and ignorant. Woman dress like they are at the strip club."
bad,First Data's training program was the worst training I have had at any of my jobs. The tried to squeeze so much info into a small period of time and sent me to work unprepared for my job.
bad,"log into computer, I would set up my systems(9)to the main frame. I would then pull my workflow in and begin mainframe cold calls to members to convince them to switch to us for processing. Answer and respond to incoming calls and emails. Calls were monitored ad rated. There were goals we had to meet daily, week, monthly. daily huddles, weekly meetings."
bad,"Only work in this department if you are extremely desperate - it's a dead end."
bad,This credit card transaction acquirer has a terrible reputation for customer service and expects long hours with little compensation from its IT employees.
bad,"Team Captain/ Trainer and OJT Coordinator"
bad,"Everything is about office politics and no one is safe. The company is trying to save money in all aspects. People are laid off for any reason... making too much money, approaching retirement, insubordination, poor performance."
bad,Company has made too many drastic changes to core businesses that have impacted Revenue Growth.. Saddled with too much debt to have impact in revenue growth
bad,"horrible management.... no bonuses,no paid vacation nothing. THEY TREAT EVERYONE HORRIBLE!!!!!!! ITS JUST SAD....when u have good workers you should treat them right stop threatening to fire them"
bad,never gave me a chance. disgraceful company. hardest  part was even getting up to go there. best part wasn't having to go after i left. and I'm glad i left
bad,"One of the worst experiences in my working career.  A company of this magnitude should not be going thru the struggles of trying to figure it out on a daily basis.  Mgt scrambles each month trying to figure out what should be routine.  They make it impossible to breathe.  One person is handling the work of 3-4 people.  Senior Mgt does not care how long it takes, as long as they shine.  They want your entire life and it is still not enough.   The salary does not equate to the number of hours required.  15-16 hours days in the office and still having to go home and login to meet unreasonable deadlines.  Once you burn out becoming physically ill, you will be terminated.  People have walked out without notice,  passed out from exhaustion or been fired because they cannot no longer work the hours."
bad,They profile you worst company ever they don go by your job quality they go by how well you can kiss u to them. They are full gossip and racial profileing
bad,working with several teams of people.  learned a lot about working with outside departments.  they had a lot of turnover of managers. I had 3-4 managers every year.  coworkers were great to work with.  dealing with new managers every other month. they all undid what the other managers did.  working with coworkers from other areas
bad,as soon as you become in their sights they do everything to get rid of you. you had to maintain a weekly average. at least they had a tv to watch during break
bad,"I do not see career advancement with my current employer. I have given a great amount of time covering shift, picking up extra overtime and assisting other agents on the call center floor"
bad,"no work/life balance - department was under staffed"
bad,"Have to hand it to them....they were pretty much straightfwd with me. It's gonna be bad, do not expect work life balance (expecting 70+ hrs a week), salary was under the market, 401k was really bad (no matching) etc etc etc.  Heavy traveling over the weekend etc.  I dropped out of the process right away.  Also, they are having financial hardships."
bad,"If you want to be spoken to like a pile of poo, this place is perfect for you! Not a fun place to work, everyone thinks their gods gift."
bad,I have never worked in such a dynamic environment where everyone hates their jobs. The directors seem clueless as to what is going on and how to do their jobs. The hours are long many lasting until 2am in the morning. It is a sweat shop. I would not recommend this company to anyone. Look elsewhere if you want to advance your accounting career.
bad,"worked in two different departments on two contracts.  their systems were built in 1991.  high turn over rate.  they are shipping all of their jobs to India.  management has a mindset of the late 80's software, they have no clue of the most current technologies.  huge IT debt across the whole company. "
bad,"It was a very very stressful place to work at, they are very strict and give out very short breaks. You only get a 30 minute lunch and 2 short 15 minute breaks. Even if you work over time, that is the only time you are provided. I hated working for this company. This company is strictly about money and they DO NOT care about their employee's none once so EVER. I would NOT recommend ANYONE to work here!!!!"
bad,This is not an employee friendly environment in which to work.  The training is not sufficient for the high stress high volume job.
bad,The work environment is melancholy. With the recent structural changes a lot of the jobs were out sourced to other states and countries. The most enjoyable part of the day is working with Co-workers who take their job serious and come in and work hard everyday. The hardest part of the job is working not knowing the next changes or where your office will be located to.
bad,"I was daily reviewing reviewing people access.  The level of the access for different people, users, areas  Created reports  creating users and reports included new documentations for national distributition"
bad,"assembly"
bad,"full-time , great atmosphere, I have pleasant co-workers, I have my own computer so I'm  experience in using different software and troubleshooting, management is great, the hardest part of my job is finding miss placed mail"
bad,I was terminated after 11 months working here.  I was only 3 weeks away from being there for a year.  I would not recommend this place to anyone to work here...the rules change every week...and if you're not a 94% in compliance on the phones you will be terminated.  There is so many rules of what you cannot do that actually helps one do their job.  In the dept I worked in we were not allowed to have pens on our desks.  And the client experience team had pens paper radios on their desks.  They like quantity over quality and I feel that mgmt doesn't fight hard for the good workers..they too are afraid to lose their jobs...so they do a lot of sucking up too.  Highly do not recommend this place to anyone to ever work here.  If temporary is what you want working here will be for you.
bad,"Management cares about nothing but themselves.  If you get sick and can't come to work, they write up, then a final and then they walk you out the door."
bad,"After working for First Data for a short time, I can see why this company is on the verge of a shut down. Most of the trainers and management are young & unprofessional. The salary is too low for the skills that they demand of you. Lunch break is too short. "
bad,"Manager a group of 10+ Security Engineers who's primary function is to stage firewall requests, push changes and 24/7 on call support. "
bad,Don't work here they send you home and it you have time to use as in personal days or sick days then at the end of the year they use it against you to not give you a rise the best way to get one is don't ever be sick don't miss a day what so ever. They don't give rise's
bad,"This place is absolutely energy draining, filled with too many negative people.  Management does not keep their promises in advancement opportunities and peers are so quick to place blame of mistakes on other peers.  Absolutely the worst environment I've ever worked in!"
bad,Not good for work life balance and nothing to learn from this project
bad,"If you seek a healthy, productive work environment, apply somewhere else. This is not a company who cares anything about their employees."
bad,This company is on a downhill spiral and even an initial public offering may not be enough for it to get out of debt and make those investor's 3.5 billion buy in be worth it.
bad,"The telesales, cross sale and business consultant roles are simply just inside sales roles. It is very controlled and extremely structured environment.  The base pay is laughable and the goals are extremely high to see a commission. If you enjoy inside merchant services sales, then you have found your place. If not, stay away from this role. High pressure, product pushing, cold environment."
bad,"A typical day working for First Data is very stressful. You are expected to complete a job with minimal reliable resources, ALOT of miscommunication & an uncomfortable working environment (they don't believe in turning on the heat). Management is OK if your on their ""good side"". I feel at times there was definitely underlining favoritism feeling among some managers. The only positive thing from this company were the co-workers you got to meet who could relate to the feeling of hating the fact that they had to work for this company."
bad,It may look like a great place to work but if you are dealing with the customer service side they lie to you regarding your pay rate. You do so much work with nothing to show for it. Managers are very cold and dont make you feel comfortable. They are only nice to you during orientation after that they want even say anything to you. they say you will see advancement in 6 months but you have people who haven't advanced in ten years which tells a lot about the company.
bad,"Reporting to the CFO, streamlined business processes and developed financial models  to achieve a 6 percent improvement of monthly close and analysis of National and Regional Sales data."
bad,will never recommend this company...that is all i will say about this company.
bad,"Workplace violence permitted a male manager was threatened, co workers cursing, shoving, threatening, sexual harassment, a fired angry employee came back into building yelling had many people scared for their safety and the HR dept did not intervene on any of these. "
bad,"-  No training"
bad,A horrible place to work. Nobody know anything and blame eachother and treat employees like slaves. DONT work here!!!
bad,"My experience is not a good one, however I do think business is business and that comes with some hard decisions. I would rather not work for this company ever. I have seen corporate greed at it's finest and I would rather work for the smaller company than this company that has never put it's customers or associates before their own needs. Money is the root of evil and so is the people who run it."
bad,The leadership at FD is lacking in continuity and motivation. Good people are leaving unfortunately.
bad,It's been challenging. There is no support from parent group in order to make the business a success.
bad,Process checks from various companies into system using different functions. I am required to accomplish clients deadlines in a team environment. Make sure clients checks are process accurately.
bad,"Team was more concerned with ""talk time"", and ""queue time"" on phones, and how many calls taken in a day."
bad,"The company's job site would be a lot more pleasurable if the work place culture at the sugar land office were more ethical, and management had more integrity."
bad,"First, you will not be promoted unless you suck up to management. They do not care about your qualifications. They show favoritism especially in the credit risk department. The managers have no management experience and they have no respect for the analyst. You are over worked and underpaid."
bad,"Worst job I’ve had... management is awful to say the least. Never get your breaks on time, forever getting the blame for everything, get moaned at all the time"
bad,"FirstData suffers from a top heavy management team that is not at all aligned with the work force.  "
bad,"Amerikanische Unternehmensführung, Informationsfluss unzureichend, ständig ändernde Vorgaben und Aufgabenverteilung, Teamleiter sitzen mit im 60-Mann-Großraumbüro-keine Diskretion! Pro Tag steht einem 30Min Zusatzpause zu, die man zB in Raucherpausen oder einfach 5min Auszeiten investieren kann, man wird jedoch schief angeschaut wenn man die voll ausschöpft, wird die Zeit kontrolliert. Aufstiegschancen werden nicht nach Eignung sondern Sympathie gewährt. Keine flexible Arbeitszeit, 40Std Woche, Einarbeitung war gut."
bad,very toxic environment. do not feel welcome at all as a new employee. they expect you to perform perfect day one! hr does not know a thing about the job.
bad,The management team is composed of selfish staff who do not consider the best interest of the customer or employee.  They all think of self-preservation and promotion
bad,The company refuses to invest in up to date ERP systems which creates high turnover due to the number of systems a new employee has to learn and the long training period.
bad,"Started with this company in 2015. Company does not care about it’s employees. 4-6 hours a week of mandatory overtime, 14 cent an hour raises, managers are not trained for the product we do making them usesless.  No chance for advancement. Only one person i ever met there moved up. Company spends money on everything but employees. They don’t even contribute to the 401K plan. I recommend looking for a great job elsewhere."
bad,"This was a great place to work up until 2016. When the focus changed from employees to “company needs.” A phrase they say very often. Lower pay “ company needs”, change benefits “ company needs”. Mandatory overtime on any day they choose; could be your off day-“ company needs “. Master schedule realignment despite having school , children it’s does not matter due to.... “company needs “. First data does not Care about its employees. The attitude is comply or quit. I hate this place now and you will too."
bad,"Constant Management Changes, a few ego tripping individuals in charge in key departments that get away with murder.  HR is useless and wouldn't, couldn't do anything."
bad,"To this company you're nothing but a number, no one cares about what you have to say or about you in general. Neither does HR, bring them an issue you are having and you'll be ignored like a dead ant on the floor. Management only care about themselves and who ever kisses up to them. You can be the best anget on the floor but if you're not kissing up to the entire management staff, you'll never advance."
bad,The company thinks  their employees  have to work on the holidays and weekends all the time.  The company wouldn't let their emplyees practice their religion they would force employees to work on their religious holiday
bad,"Terrible Company, Lost and Void of Leadership. Never recovered from years of poor leadership under KKR. Revolving door of people and leadership establishes a poor culture void of integrity, promise and values. Too many ""old"" school thinkers. Overall the company is LOST in a sea of change in the payments industry."
bad,"Don't take a job at this company. They are constantly transitioning jobs oversees so there is no stability. Director level and above management is completely out of touch with how to create a good culture. The turnover is insane which speaks to the lack of culture and overall issues with the company. The systems are antiquated and there is no desire to fix it. Management's answer is to not fix the systems and to even place tighter deadlines that results in longer hours, and by longer I mean past midnight. Honestly, worse job I have ever had."
bad,This company is horrible overworked under payed the management team has no direction at all. The management team needs training horrible environment. If you know was good for you don't apply to this company
bad,"The work environment at First Data is constantly shuffling and rarely stable.  I have learned that as with many other large companies being nimble is a necessity.  Unfortunately, that nimbleness sometimes means looking for new employment when positions or entire departments are closed for business reasons."
bad,"I was very disappointed during the 8 months I spent at First Data.  I was told at one time this was one of the best companies to work for as far as benefits.  No 401 k match, health insurance was expensive unless you are on a deductible plan which defeats the purpose and your spouse is not eligible to get on your benefits if they are offered coverage through their work.  I was not impressed at all, no focus on development, hiring freezes constantly which creates a stressed work environment for all and unrealistic work loads."
bad,Pay could be a little better and there are no perks to working for a fortune 500 company. Management was not good  but I had a great supervisor.
bad,"Employee morale at First Data is very poor.  Employees are constantly worried about their job status, due to numerous restructures and the difficulty of career advancement.  The beginning of the 4th quarter, they terminate hundreds of employees based on their previous year end review and their mid year end review.  These are not lay offs, these are straight terminations without rehire options.  Hourly and salary employees are affected by this termination.  "
bad,"Fine company to work for.  Worked 11:00 PM to 7:30 am"
bad,"Run, Run away as fast as you can..It's a sinking ship. This company has cut 401k, health insurance, and compensation each year, and currently 35 million in the red"
bad,"The only reason Im still here after this long is to take of my family. The environment is so not like any place Ive ever worked. Its like being in elementary school all over again. The work is very easy once anyone decides to train you. As far as the people its ridiculous, including management. If you havent been there forever or a new kisser up youll never get anywhere or any recognition. Depending on who you are or who you hang out with after work you may or may not have to follow any rules but others are crucified for being 1 minute late. Breaks and lunchs are on a schedule and you are being watched closely unless you're a favorite then you can have 1 1/2 lunches. Run from this place if you want your sanity."
bad,"First Data went through a transformational change during a period of global adjustments to worldwide payment processing systems."
bad,"A lot of departments are jokes; huge high school reunions where certain people are teachers pets and get the highest raise when it comes to annual review and always worry about other people's jobs and what everyone else is doing so they can run and tell, instead of working on their own position to get work done faster. Management is a joke and delegates everything to someone else even when it's an issue you went to them to address. Extremely high turnover rate."
bad,"I was hired fulltime, but half the time you are going home early or leaving as soon as you got there because there was no work. Management didn't have the decency to call you ahead of time to notify you not to come in.   They expect you to make production when there is not enough work to do even if you are sent home early. earearly.trewriteyou up."
bad,Horrible Company I was on my 5th VP in 10 months. They all left the company. My SVP before they let him go was a real screamer! It seems that they think you respond well to fear as a tactic. Fear for your job unless you were in NY with the cronies of the current CEO!
bad,They pay new people more than people that have been there for 10 years. This place sucks! Work all holidays and if you are not kissing your bosses butt you will get nowhere at this company work you to death and gain very little!
bad,No job security and management is terrible. Noone is on the same page in management and is a very stressful non stop calls all day long. Training was good but alot to cram into 2 weeks and the quality team was not on same page as well.
bad,First Data never promoted from within and had toxic culture of always promoting people associated with the current CEO.  Several poor decisions led to mass layoffs over the years and to a workplace which did not provide a good work and life balance.  Also the benefits for a company as large as FD were miserable.
bad,The managers are horrible with communication! They'll be nice to you once they need something but besides that they're shady as can be. All the managers gossip about the employees too. The pay is sad. The only good thing about the place is the employees. Your coworkers will make it a tolerable place. Besides that be prepared for a highschool feel. You're not allowed to talk to peers or say no to managers because you'll be scolded. The best thing I ever did was walk out that place. Those managers dont know how to talk to or treat their employees. I don't see this company lasting too long.
bad,Es könnte noch schlechter sein. Stress und Unsicherheit dominiert die Mehrheit der Mitarbeiter. Keine Unternehmens Kultur. Total negatives Arbeitsklima.
bad,"Absolutely no job security at this company.  Layoffs every quarter.  Terrible support systems for clients, both internal and external.  No work life balance.  Wonderful co-workers."
bad,"This company track your badege when you enter the front door, exit, or get up from your desk.  This company promotes long time employees without college degrees to become management. There is a culture here that is the opposite of professional/educated. "
bad,"The company doesn't provide good job stability at the Hagerstown, MD site.  Projects and departments are started but then are moved to other locations and employees in those positions need to either find jobs within the company or lose their positions.  For example, the Clover Application was initially started in Hagerstown and once it was successful moved to another site.  The Clientline employees group supporting Business Track was substantially cut down when First Data opened a call center in the Dominican Republic."
bad,Tough environment with upper level management out of touch with the rank and file.  They seem to be much more interested in lining their own pockets than actually driving the business forward.
bad,"this company has the employees cross training in too many skills with out the full knowledge of the calls that will be taking. "
bad,"First Data has a reputation of doing annual layoffs based on attendance, pay grade and annual review which is very objectional. Their health benefits are very costly for a family And do not use their tuition plan, they will tax you 20% as they consider a reimbursement income. Their pay is based on location and well below average salary for the role. Internal promotion is a joke. I was actually told by a recruiter to leave and get experience elsewhere then come back and hung up on and I was an internal applicant. Again avoid this place, If you are looking for longevity."
bad,"Απαράδεκτo εργασιακό περιβάλλον. "
bad,"First Data has some tremendous technology solutions that are helpful to many businesses ranging from SMB to enterprise. However, the lack of available internal resources makes it a very frustrating place to work. The company emphasizes selling above all, but the lack of support, both for the sales reps and customers, make it difficult to achieve sales goals unless you wear blinders. Even management cannot get issues addressed in a timely manner."
bad,Was a great place to work for when I first started but new management was poor and mishandled plenty of different things. People used to love coming into work and even volunteering to work OT because you felt compensated not only monetarily but also appreciated by your managers. All that changed including hard workers being let go for cheaper less quality employees and overworking employees with ridiculous expectations without replacing open positions. Job security was always an issue as managers would say one thing and turn around and do another. Was better under previous management.
bad,Not a great place to be.   Can find a better place to work with opportunities and culture.  Being treated like a human and not a possession is a key and they dont get that here
bad,"Great pay disparity among new hires, ranges from a few dollars on an hourly job, to as great a $10 above other's pay per hour. Not equitable across the board in hiring practices for hourly positions' wages, so obviously favoritism from the start."
bad,Very unprofessional management. Favoritism is throughout the entire building. The pay is not suitable for what all is required. Great shifts. Horrible parking !
bad,"Daily Service Advisor tasks include but are not limited to:"
bad,The card processing industry is corrupt and employees were encouraged to lie to clients. Small businesses were given stricter regulations and we were less empowered to help them versus larger companies. This was unethical for me personally.
bad,"In the early days of the company, leadership was great. After KKR, everything went to pot. They took away pto days, 401k, went to high deductible insurance."
bad,"Constant overtime.  Constant of moving management team around.  Never knew day to day who your manager was going to be."
bad,"The constant threat of layoffs is a depressing cloud hanging over everyone's head.  Watching a company continue to purge their workforce of highly qualified and skilled workers, is beyond stupid.  Especially when they don't have a qualified person to fill the void."
bad,not a company i would work for or refer a person too.  Not truthful and never let you know if something has changed so you can be responsible for your position. They play all kinds of games with you.
bad,Department went through a layoff.  A lot of insecurities and resentment lingers.  Most of the team members are the absolute best and hard workers.  Just wish management were better managers.
bad,"Do NOT work for this company. Every employee is expendable. The culture is centered around people who have worked together many years and there is a clique mentality. Management is incompetent and they take their lead from lower level employees within the clique. The company fails to accommodate employees in violation of EEO rights. The pay is competitive but for the lack of professionalism and respect for hardworking top- talent who refuse to be a part of the clique culture, the job simply is not worth it."
bad,The Clover department is a very poor area to work in.   They target people to get them fired/laid off by targeting how you perform on calls so even if you do well they will find a way to make you fail your quality.
bad,"Challenging to maintain work / life balance with increasingly high demands."
bad,Dont take this job unless you are desperate. The turnover is extreme and you will be let go within 6 months. Management is horrible and the department has been run into the ground.
bad,"In a little over 2 years, 17 Accounting staff have quit, been fired, or located to other departments within the company. They promote their 'favorites' and all of the others are just biding their time until something better comes along. Managers are promoted based on who their buddies are and not on their qualifications are. If you want minimal raises and incompetent bosses, this is the place for you."
bad,"I spent over 12 years as a dedicated employee.  I thought I would have been valuable enough to post for other positions, but when my job was outsourced, I was turned down for every job I applied for.  That told me that they don't value good workers at all.  Perhaps it was my age."
bad,"First Data is an interesting place to work.  It's products and services are complex and intellectually stimulating.  However, the company's back office accounting processes are archaic and outdated.  It's mainframe operational platforms do not interface well with the accounting system creating the need for an army of accountants to do lots of manual re-classifications and adjustments."
bad,"Company is closing Melville Office so not much to say about it.  I only have worked there for six months, the people are nice and everyone is friendly."
bad,"Pay was good. But, little to no cost of living increases."
bad,"Coworkers and management did not get alone, poor management. They treat new employees as if they were not important to the company. They will give you a load of work and expected to be done in hours, when in reality you should have more time."
bad,"Too many Mangers not enough workers.  When there is a cut they always seem to forget to cut out the multiple Managers within the departments.  It is amazing to see that there are at least 2 Managers for the same Department performing the exact function.  When eliminating duplicate functions, they always seem to be forgotten.  I had a Manager who was constantly falling asleep in his office in front of his PC.  However, this Manager survives all the cuts.  Good workers get the cut instead.  Some get on the list of cuts due to reporting their Manager's to HR.  Upper Management seem to be blind in what is going on in each department or they just enjoy seeing those types of Managers taking space, making good salaries, and causing stress to their employees.  If you report your Manager, you seem to get on their list of elimination as soon as a new lay-off is announced.."
bad,"I'm a young male who worked on the collections team, the job was described to me that there was lots of potential for other roles within etc etc."
bad,There is no room for advancement.  They hire outside the company instead of promoting within.
bad,A typical day would be consulting with potential merchants to offer credit card payment optiond for their customers
bad,"You'll be blindsided when your laid off.  Your treated like dirt and if you don't fit the mold, your out the door.  Politics are bad.  I absolutely hate this company."
bad,"There are some good people to work for, and then there are the PharmD, who believe they are God's gift to the world (with the exception of one). First Databank LOVE to have meetings. You'll spend half you day in meetings you don't belong in. This includes the all-hands meetings, were upper-management spends a few hours talking about how great they are doing. I did at least get to spend half my time developing database solutions, but it's hard to work, then you're running between meetings all day. Morale was very low when I was there. There also seem to be a whisper on the air that we wouldn't be around very long. High turn-over is routine."
bad,"I relocated to Omaha to a position with First Data. There were indications of a problem in the interview process that I overlooked (Sr. Mgr interviewed me for a job decription outside of the scope of the position I applied for(?)). My hiring manager ""disappeared"" within the first 30 days of my arrival(left me a message to ""watch my back""). The organization was very siloed...people with the division did not know one another..policies and procedures were non existent...people hoarded information and methodology because it was job security...Serious diversity issues(regular slams against other cultures in meetings) evidenced by leadership...."
bad,"Gestores despreparados, excesso de processos, falta de clareza, áreas sem integração e sem política comercial competitiva"
bad,"Management is in disarray, there's a lot of office politics, favoritism is prevalent, everyone tries to cover themselves, fear of calculated failure, and strong resistance to change."
bad,The work itself was okay it was the management and the inconsistency with advancements that was promised. There were rules that was implemented then changed for no reason and to many quotas that needed to be meet but did not match the description of the work at hand
bad,You’re just a compliance number and the morale is terrible unless you are a higher manage ment. Seems to basically be a sweat shop but instead you have a head piece attached to your ear.
bad,"Revolving door in upper management led to inconsistent policies and high turnover in employees. Warped sense of ""ownership"" led to finger pointing, distrust, and ""buss driving"".."
bad,"The only way to move up at this place is to move out. The lunch was too short. When i was breastfeeding and needed to pump they asked me to use a ""sick room""."
bad,First Data was a great company to work. Now people are leaving in droves taking years of knowledge with them. Management doesn't care about the employees and doesn't attempt to retain knowledge. You go into work daily wondering if you will be fired.
bad,work start day   come in to alot of work sometimes that 3rd shift didn't finish.  work being held over that shouldn't have been to be a team player.  the management sucks none of them is on the same page they see things that's wrong but only want to correct it when the see fit or will cover there butt.  its a mixture of people.  it wasn't that hard of a job the just wanted you to do your job n someone elses  which was not fair.  some of the  co-workers and  time to go home.
bad,"Its not worth it.  Find a better place to work that supports your true purpose.  It seems like its a great place, but really they just rob you in so many ways.  Go live your dreams, don't give this greedy financial industry any more of your time or money."
bad,Terminated all in house employees for temp employees in order to pay them barely over minimum wage. Working conditions were poor as it is in a warehouse and were made to stand all day.
bad,"- Very little job security"
bad,"First of all the locations vary wildly on culture and work life balance so please keep that in mind. "
bad,"People I worked with on the same level were all lovely , pay was ok , bonus and points system really good ... management absolutely awful , very rude and nasty , high staff turnover because of this , have to get to your seat 15 mins before you start to set up without being paid for it ... not allowed toilet breaks only on your specified break time ... if your sick , or child is sick or there's an emergency such as a death in the family they don't care and harass you by telephone until your too scared to take time off . They use chocolate and cakes as incentives to work so weight gain isn't rife here .. If your looking for an in between job to get you by this is what your looking for ;-)"
bad,"Horrible management, doesn't care at all about employee development. Very stressful place to work , they build a culture of siloing information, even though they expect you to know everything. Not a great place to work."
bad,The change in leadership resulted in low morale. Many benefits were stripped down or taken away. Many employees were barely making ends meet while the new CEO continued to get richer.
bad,Long hours and they are trying to send work overseas. They do not care about the impact to customers as long as the bottom line shows good numbers.  Did not get a raise for 2 years due to low company profits but the CEO was 6th highest paid in the world.
bad,Managers have no clue what you are doing and only base your value off of the numbers generated by an outdated program.  Managers only talk to you if there are problems.  Management is completely removed from the actual work that is being conducted.
bad,"Continually take away benefits, consistently laying people off and not back filling positions.  I understand wanting to increase revenue and decrease expensive, however, one person can only do so much."
bad,They will give 2% max raise if any. They don't match on 401k anymore. And the medical insurance is unusable. They are currently getting rid of all the 10-year employees so they can bring in people that get paid less and have less vacation time so they can save a buck
bad,"Horrible leads loaded into an auto dialer, admins ignore disposition of calls and requests of prospects to be put on do not call lists.  Same leads called by different brands over and over again."
bad,"Company has a high turnover rate. You have to fight to get vacation time. Management lacks communication skills. AC and Heat would go out at least once a month and they still expect you to work with no ventilation. No restaurants in immediate area so if you don't drive, bring your lunch. Bathrooms are unkept. Lack of accountability. Lack of cross-training. The only good thing about this job is the casual dress code and a few friendly coworkers."
bad,...was a very great place to work before the company became private. Once the company became private and the lay-offs began it became an extremely stressful environment with one person doing at least three persons job without positive recognition.
bad,"I have either worked full-time or did consulting engagements at probably 30-50 businesses and never saw an organization so poorly run. Senior management is absolutely clueless what goes on."
bad,The company doesnt care about you and just want you to make your numbers. It worked out nicely for some people I worked with but just not a long term company for me.
bad,"The company is operated poorly. Employees are treated like an expendable number and if asked without the fear of being fired would agree and then some. The company manages with fear of getting fired.  The health care benefits are TERRIBLE!!!! They lay off people, departments and whole facilities without hesitation nor advance notice.  You have a job today but you will have no idea if you have one next month."
bad,"It doesn't matter how long anyone has worked there, when the company is falling short, needs cash, and/or wants to bring in another executive, they start laying off employees again.  It is only an undetermined amount of time, with no notice, that an employee is out of a job immediately.  Their layoff reputation is terrible within the city and the industry."
bad,Working at First Data from a day to day basis has shown me an thousands of other employees here that this company is a prime example of a Good company gone bad.
bad,"First Data was a great place to work and I loved my job of 12 years, business analyst on coverting new business on to First Data. Then KKR bought First Data. Anyone making so much money was released, including me. I was hired back at one position and moved to another position. They had a big project going on and when it completed a many employees and contractors were released, and I was one of them."
bad,Process checks and also run a machine call 50/51 Opex when needed. Sometimes it can be a little hectic when trying to meet a deadline.
bad,"This company is private and is around 22 billion in debt. They are run like they have major cash flow issues. My computer was a relic. The benefits get worse every year. Healthcare benefits and 401k used to be good, but now is horrible. I mean really, really bad. My own department was okay, but dealing with other departments really stunk. They all seemed lazy and unmotivated to do work.They were rude and grumpy if they had to do anything. They were outright and shockingly, and obviously dishonest and lied about things just to get out of doing anything. There  is also a lot of blame. I had to deal with this a lot. No department wants to be accountable for the work, so they say that's some other department's job. Then that other department also says it's someone else' job. As for the managers, they are not knowledgeable about the business most of the time. Shockingly dumb and ignorant. Lazy too. They should at least have the decency to make it look like they are working instead of having loud private conversations by the break room all day. They don't promote from within much. Upper management is bad too. You get these outsiders who know next to nothing about the business and who are also very prideful and unwilling to learn either. Thus the 22 billion in debt. They are running it into the ground. They have a new CEO, things may get better, but obviously bad things they don't fix because they have such bad politics there. How clueless can you get. It's shocking."
bad,"Working at FD had me very sick. The call center was very stressful. Management does not care if you are on your death bed, you must work. The metrics are too much and management is waaay worse. They promote who they want so barely any room to move around. There are pervs and unprofessionals working at the company. The benefits are good I must say. That’s my only positive. Don’t forget the mandatory overtime when they are understaffed."
bad,Nothing good to say other than great people holding on. Sending jobs overseas and hiring H-1B Visas. Moral going downhill like crazy. New York ran and don’t care about their employees.
bad,"Plan on moving.  Emphasis on saving money for company.  If you don't mind moving to a different area, that's fine.  Advanced with technology.   Nice people.  Large turnover."
bad,"First Data used to be a great place to work.  But in recent years it has been in a downward spiral where morale and enjoyment of work is concerned.  CEO has taken a great deal away from employees (no longer matching 401K, reduced PTO, no raises, bonuses given in funny money - stock options).  Immediate leadership on the government program have continually fostered an environment that is demeaning and demoralizing.  A great many long term employees with a great deal of business knowledge have walked out the door.  New hires have lasted on average 1-2 years before getting fed up with the dysfunction.  Leadership thinks that people are plug-and-play, and as long as the books show that the program has x number of bodies (mostly contractors at this point in time) then they've got it covered."
bad,"In the spring of each year First Data hires smart people, pays them well, and then puts them on a lay-off list at the end of the year in order to meet corporate earnings. In between the culture beats them down with accusations and insinuations. The only ones who get to stay are blandly doing a niche job that no one else wants."
bad,"Horrible culture, soulless and an experience I wish I could regret. Classic case of 'the old guard', stuck in there way and not willing to evolve for fear of exposing serious knowledge gaps. "
bad,"- every day was stress, often with a queue of 30 plus people waiting. all of which were angry, dissatisfied, and willing to take it out on you."
bad,It felt like the company preferred to keep their employment levels understaffed and their employees overworked. Part-time employees were working full-time hours without the benefits. We constantly had to log in from home. Our job was definitely not a leave at work job. It was not uncommon to be leaving for the day only to be stopped due to some crisis or another and end up working another five hours. It was also common to be working on 10 - 12 projects at any given time.
bad,"-Management was ok"
bad,"The most difficult part of working at First Data is upper management's attitude. They make it quite clear they are doing everything possible to replace you with off-shore workers. Upper management also goes out of its way to make sure you understand how little worth you really provide to the company.  It's the CEO's way of putting everyone in their place. It makes First Data a pretty gloomy place to work."
bad,"Very stressful environment to work in, staff were always and very rude l. Never could get time off when needed.  Help was never available when needed. Managers were always rude and not friendly"
bad,I worked in the fraud department. Interesting working with merchants and stopping fraud from happening. Checking on customers to make sure they were the ones authorizing the transactions. Management was fun team friendly. Very diverse environment. People would be very upset if their credit cards was being held up.
bad,"Riddled with poor management and frequent lay offs made working for First Data stressful. Although there was advancement opportunity, the management got worse with each promotion."
bad,"Management was a terrible experience, and the company downsizes on a regular basis. The company is a good place to grow with only if you are in a good position."
bad,The company is flexible in terms of schooling and working. Management are favored... They have their favorites who they trust and if you are not on their team you continuously get wrtiten up for crazy things like saying you don't like something basically don't have an opinion
bad,"First data can be a good place to work. Has the pros and cons just like any other job. This company has no growth. Leadership stinks!! Even a lateral move will get the attention of the supervisor and now you're a victim of harassment. Supervisor bullies employees with confrontations and loud talk! Company cares nothing about your personal life. You can only be sick 5 times a year and the rest is a paper trail and termination, including family sickness! because sick time is an unexcused absence. Co-workers are extremely nice and helpful. The biggest turnover company I ever worked for. Always new employees, but not new supervisors!! They're the problem!!!"
bad,"To many managers not enough workers, take tools away that are needed to do your job.  No training or documentation on how to do your job."
bad,It is a great place to work. From the beginning to end of shift you will not get bored due to lack of work. They are very open to training in unfamiliar job positions and gives the opportunity for advancement.
bad,"Though the job is interesting and the people that work there are very easy to get along, The benefits are pretty much worthless.  A job that pays $9.75 per hour yet has a $2000 deductible for medical benefits is simply unusable.  The supervisors in the fraud department are wonderful.  The work environment is very nice and clean.  The opportunities for advancement are there.  However, the usual pay hike is usually in the .40-.50 cent range.  There are a number of opportunities at First Data.  If you are in a bind, they will pretty much hire anyone as long as you don't have a felony on your record."
bad,"Was fired after working there a year. Apparently they do a lot of layoffs for money. Was told by upper management that an associate of 12 yrs was being laid off for the 8th time when I was hired. Another manager told me it would take two years to learn the entire process. Had to rely on random one hour side by sides to learn job. If I asked any questions, which is normal (even though supervisor would ensure it was ok during staff meetings) manager would state me and another new associate could not ask questions. Manager new at date of interview I had 12 credits left of school. Stated on date of ternination ""this isn't the place for you, I need a sr. Associate"". After I had just resigned from my last job of 6.5 Years. There is no training for new associates so do not risk your future putting faith in this company. Cousin who has a mechanic shop also stated be careful if you're thinking of using them as a transaction processor for your business."
bad,"I accepted a temporary position at First Data. The initial interview was brief and the hiring manager was pleasant. Unfortunately, I was not given a tour of the entire work floor until I was hired. When I stepped onto the production floor my first day, I was shocked by an unprofessional culture where tenured employees spend more time discussing their food stamp benefits and baby daddy drama than doing the remedial work of opening and processing remittance payments. There is no work to do outside of the first few days each month so most weeks you work a 20/hr. The pay for the most tenured employees is well below poverty level. First Data is a revolving door where at least one temporary employee is let go each week for no reason other than not fitting into the impoverished, ghetto culture where there is no desire for advancement or education just  complatency in making enough to secure a project apartment, sneakers and flat screens."
bad,"This company has no regard for worker rights or federal labor law. 7 day work weeks are just normal practice. Minimum 6 day work week. If you have a family or a life in any form, you do not want to work at this company in any capacity.  The work and environment are nice, great people and really positive place to work. But, if you're real lucky you'll get one day off every 2 to 3 weeks."
bad,"First Data has once again proven that large public corporations only care about the money and not their employees."
bad,No advancement.  Not empowered to make decisions.   Management cares little for employees.   Departments don’t work with each other.  Very little development or chance for promotion.
bad,"Good company ideals, poorly executed.  The only way to keep your job or advance is to know the right people and do the right things (if you know what I mean.)  Basically its a popularity contest.  The work itself is great, but the management team, not so much.  People are constantly being let go and replaced, positions are desolved and they lay people off in mass at least twice a year.  If you're looking for a short term job, it's great, but I wouldn't make any long term plans.  I may have been a temporary employee, but I can say I don't want to be hired on even though it was offered."
bad,"friendly staff, pretty easy once you get used to it."
bad,"First Data used to be a great place to work, even though it was a high-pressure environment. Problems really surfaced with new senior management, cutting staffing and eliminating the breadth of experience provided by seasoned technical staff. Extreme pressure  placed on mid-level managers, resulting in competing and conflicting priorities between managers. Engineering and technical staff were constantly bombarded with demands to do more with less, service demands without appropriate resources, such that personal job performance suffered without complete sacrifice of work-life-balance."
bad,"First Data will take as much as they can from you. All the while giving as little back as they can legally get away with. This is not a good company to work for. It is stressful, soul crushing, and not a good long term choice."
bad,"Very Stressful,  I would not recommend this company to anyone.  I have worked for various companies and industries and bar none this is the worst environment.  Reactive firefighting is ongoing and getting worse not better.  No leadership to encourage you.  If you do your job, you are expected to do more, it you are doing above and beyond you are criticized."
bad,"Excellent corporate learning environment- provides opportunity to to learn various aspects of the corporate environment. As a high volume employer of 5,000 locally the company provides a broad range of positions in both the administrative and productive sectors. The position training opportunities are abundant and accompanied with a good higher education reimbursement program. Although the company is filled with talented employees the advancement process is greatly hindered by politics and lacks accountability for those presenting barriers to career growth. Very poor job security due to multiple layoffs, position eliminations and workforce reduction measures. The company does provide an array of perks and work incentives however they do not outweigh the unpredictability of the culture.  Workplace and position resources are readily available however access is subject to change without notice.The company's compensation program is satisfactory yet is incomplete in regard to providing retirement security (offers no 401k matching). The internal mobility program is currently being overhauled and is greatly in need of this effort. First Data currently does not provide enough emphasis on promoting internally rather than hiring externally.Traditionally the company is rated low as a career employer yet making good strides to improve this status. Company makes excellent good faith employment efforts however the senior leadership does not reflect the ethnic diversity of the community. First data does promote community non-profit organization support and should be commended for those efforts.Although"
bad,"Coworkers are generally very nice and get along well with easily"
bad,"I was hired as a contract to hire Project Management position for an agreed upon time frame of six months to a year. I was told it was their plan. I heard about FD laying people off a lot so I even asked. They assured me everything would be fine. I got laid off after a week and a half. The only reason I was given was because one of the execs changed his/her mind, wanting the budget to look better for the merger with Fiserv. "
bad,The work environment is very unorganized and constantly changing. There isn't always a solution to important issues. Management is not properly trained in the department they are overseeing at times. There is pressure to meet goals that are unattainable and unrealistic.
bad,"Bank Services"
bad,The job is great but the staff is horrible. No way to improve yourself within the company. Usually make up there own rules and guidelines. Not trustworthy at all!!
bad,"if you don't have life this is the place for you, you work every weekend and all week long "
bad,The immediate manager I had was great and people I work with are great but the upper level leadership are cutthroat and don't care about their people.
bad,"Aufgabe war interessant, Anlernprozess OK, Unternehmen und Mitarbeiter sind traumatisiert über die Endlassungen der letzten Jahre, statt Wohlwollen, werden Schwächen der Neuen gesucht, um zu kritisieren und eigene Position/Wichtigkeit herauszustellen."
bad,"This is not company to grow with, you will not learn anything new to industry however its a secured placed to work when you do not have anything going on."
bad,"I started working for First Data back in April of this year and it was for the chargeback department for a data processor , who handled Merchant/Cardholder disputes on charges, I answered more than 100 calls a day from angry merchants who were losing money from cardholders who have  disputed their purchases with the merchants. Management would give us help but mostly it was the incorrect information it was the responsibility of the regular Representative if quality monitored the call and management gave incorrect information the representative would have to suffer the consequences and fail the call for incorrect information given. I love the hours since I have a boy who is about to turn 8 it was a 9:30 am to 6:00 pm and it was monday through friday, for the employees/co workers I worked with were great people truly helpful."
bad,The company expects more and more from their employees while offering less and less in compensation.  There is no job security in this company at all.
bad,"Some senior people always watch your timings such as, breaks and lunch time what time you come in what time you leave etc., no work life balance. The worst thing is very short lunch break and no fun at work very serious all the time. They want you to be workaholic person."
bad,The company spent very little time training its leaders to know and understand its sales process and how to work through all its different areas to get deals completed.  SO every day was OJT or learn from one of your peers.  there was constant turn over and changes in leadership.  company moved in many different directions
bad,"I've been here for almost 7 years literally because it pays the most in my area and I can't do manual labor anymore. I can't tell you how many mental breakdowns i've had here or how many times i've lost it on calls and had to walk off the floor because of the unrealistic expectations. They want you to do the job of 10 or more departments (not joining)  without the extra pay or title and get upset when you can't do it fast enough, try to say no or ask for a raise. Everyone here acts like they are in high school with the gossip and drama. They do give reward points to redeem for cash and there are a few fun events thrown. There are some perks like tuition reimbursement but you have to stay for 3 years or pay that back and the major has to relate to your job to qualify. The raises are low and you have to move departments to get a good one. You're also expendable regardless of how good you are. Don't make too much because you'll be the first to go. I'd not recommend this place to anyone unless you want them to suffer."
bad,Too many chiefs not enough Indians. Bullying and harassment are the norm there. Suck up employees are back stabbers. Women sleep with the supervisors to gain power in the workplace. The managers don’t do anything for anyone unless you are in there group. Managers are thieves.
bad,it sucks at this place i worked my tail off and got fired cause i was a couple min late on my time sheet mind you i worked extra on weekends cause they was under staff this place sucks i tell you
bad,"I spent 10 years at this company, I only enjoyed working there two years until upper management and department management changed to the ""New First Data"". after that change there was constant fear of being laid off, employee stress levels soared and employees began to feel like just another butt in the chair that was easily replaceable at any moment. Low employee work/life balance, especially for managers. And no employee promotion or upward career pathing at all, only lateral moves to different departments for similar pay. Employees are micro managed and department managers had no clue how to do employees jobs in their own department as well as management were never around and constantly in meetings for projects not even related to their particular departments functions."
bad,A typical day at work was typical.  There was management.  There was culture that existed in the workplace.  The hardest part of the job was the job...
bad,Answered incoming phone calls for a government agency.  The government agency was very restrictive with what was allowed to inform the caller of what steps they need to take in the event of a problem.  Simple payment processing.  People were nice most of the time.  Strict time keeping of work.
bad,When employed with FirstData you realize there is not much career opportunity or development. They do not care about their employees and often have issues with payroll.
bad,Empresa pouco dinamica e responder às necessidade do mercado
bad,"As a former Customer Service Manager, I've brought to the table many suggestions and admirable initiative. Due to lack of support from Team Leaders, Supervisors and Managers, proper coaching for improvement was not implemented. Lack of promotions, raises and bonuses."
bad,"PHH had a great training program for their employees. However, being that I was a remote underwriter I felt a bit disconnected with my team. Other than that it was overall a descent company."
bad,This is a fun place to work with monthly incentives.  The people that work there and fun and enjoyable.  Hotels bring lunch a lot.

bad,If you are looking for a good job this is not the one.  The pay is low and they have a system that is old and not up to date.  You will receive so many errors due to their weak system.  Management is a mess it is always controversy between employees and leads.  Save yourself and keep looking you do not want to work for this company. It is a one man show with the worst managers and supervisors ever. You work there a month and they will fire you so don't waste your time.
bad,"Wasted lots of money.  Would book conferences and pay $50,000 deposit then would cancel and lose everything."
bad,"Its a good place to work if your related to someone in higher management and then your guaranteed to have a job for life.It probably would be a good place to work if some management was there based on their qualifications instead of friendship.No room for advancement,and you hardly get your 40 hours a week.Its little to no training because its by other co workers,then your left to figure the job out on your own."
bad,Company is always evolving to stay competitive with of leaders in payment processing. There are lots of career advancement opportunities. Affinity groups help to keep the company diverse.
bad,"This place is for people who are workaholics. This place thinks work is more important than family. Working both days on a weekend is a negative when it comes to family. Working five days a week is good and working an extra day should be voluntary. The zipsort department thinks that employees have to work 6 days a week all the time. They don""t ask if employees to work the 6 days a week."
bad,I loved working for the company. The management needs improvement.. there is too much micro management and not enough trust between management and employees
bad,It was a great company with great people in a high volume call center where you had be able to answer the customer question and concerns in a timely manner.
bad,"I was previously employed by First Data and left the company on good terms. I left to start my own business and was told that if I ever wished to return to First Data, they would look forward to that day. It is now some years later, and I had always admired First Data and had decided to re-employment at their organization. I recently applied for one of the many vacant customer service positions at First Data. About three months passed during which I heard nothing in from the company. The other week I finally received an email thanking me for my application ""However, the company is seeking better-qualified candidates for open customer service positions?"
bad,"Good benefits for your family, requires a lot of mandatory overtime hours every week, not enough employees high turn over rate, over all a good company I enjoyed the benefits."
bad,"Management unprofessional "
bad,"Its been so long since ive worked there. I remember getting along well with my team mates and the manager.  At the time, there were Directors with no one reporting to them.  I was not a good work life balance."
bad,"Unstable, really don't get 40 hrs/wk, they offer OT but no work comes in, if there's nothing to do they will send you home, Only care about numbers and productivity but you can't be productive if there no work flowing in the door"
bad,"Over promise and under deliver.  Their slogan is ""We work half days.""  8am to 8pm.  No work/life balance and you better have an in with the powers that be.  Nothing wrong with working hard, but the reward must be there.  Incentive plan should be removed and state base salary only as there always seems to be a reason why your incentive pay is less than expected or you don't receive it at all.  Recurring Revenue of existing accounts are not fully transparent."
bad,"Leadership does not care about employees personal health or lives, people with sick children were not allowed to be with them, and demanded to work Saturdays with no consideration in return, Bully style leadership"
bad,"Meetings focused on pleasing management vs the customers"
bad,"Learn about corporate America"
bad,"Balance transfers is great as a pitstop job and a good way to get into financial services."
bad,"FD would benefit greatly from actually listening to their employees, tackling real issues (resource escalations everywhere yet layoffs happening at the same time, no standard processes/procedures, lack of employee investment, stop having people do ""working vacations"" so they can really take time off, no collaboration or inclusiveness)."
bad,"Managers aren’t trained to manage employees. They fire people who are protected by ADA Act. Especially, if they’re absent because of their ADA. Previously, employees have appropriate ADA documentation on file. They still fire them for attendance."
bad,"It's a good first-time entry level job.  Training is mostly good to excellent.  The benefits are below average.  They have a history of low wages and layoffs.  It did give me customer service and IT experience, will use and put on my resume.  If your average, willing to except low wages and show up to work regularly, it is easy to move up."
bad,Do not work here. Not much more to say. Horrible culture good people though in the trenches. Look for a good client group to support. You will work below your skill level.
bad,"A typical day at work consist of auditing, escalations and constant guiding of my team. I have not learned a lot as the opportunity has not been given. Management is inconsistent."
bad,"The culture as dictated by my section manager was that of bully management. He threatened people with written job warnings if his ideals of perfection were not met. When one of my staffers made an error I was directed to issue a warning. I refused and subsequently he warned me. I refused to sign it. I chose to speak with the staffer, point out the error and suggested corrective action. He went on to be a productive participant in the unit."
bad,"Management is ever changing.  "
bad,This company needs some help if its going to survive much longer.  Management and CEO turnover is unreal.
bad,The program could be complicated and we were always instructed to blame postal service if payment made by patient received a late fee added on.  Mainly all reps were looking for other work.
bad,"I was in the production area, ran many different machinery. You will be stuck on your shift very hard to get days. Work is slow at times hard to make a paycheck. Some Co-workers are ok at times some very hard to deal with no commication what so ever ,Management is ok, other than making higher salary cuts to employees and starting wage is the same for the last 11 years. Very hard to get raises didn't get one for 3 years. Benefits were good now very average. I learned it wasn't a bad job just not a very good one either!"
bad,"The management is not trained well. They lack empathy and compassion. The company lacks fromal training classes and the atmosphere sucks, very poor morale."
bad,"No room for advancement. They didn’t care about you, you were just a number. Old out dated equipment  to worried about other departments to put money in remit"
bad,"It is a very stessful work environment, poor management, low pay, and no job security, not many opportunities to move up in the company. It is ok for a first job."
bad,They do not value employees hard work nor do they take into consideration the work they have done when promoting. Promotions are given on who knows who and who likes who
bad,"First Data is a place where you will meet grate coworkers, however being the largest credit card processing company, technology offered is non existent, basic benefits and horrible salaries."
bad,"Many Changes in company structure occurred often, a bit unstable as a result. The work was  challenging and could have been rewarding if management was more stable."
bad,Employees are at the lowest of the totem pole and top talent is even not considered worthy when it comes to job cuts.  Deeply low morale overall with lees people doing more work and with uncertain employment considerations
bad,CEO is the highest paid CEO in corporate America yet the company barely turns a profit. Solution to growth is to cut pay and benefits - not a good plan.
bad,"The culture is not very healthy. Senior management takes the ""blame everyone else"" approach and assumes very little responsibility for the culture and lack of resources."
bad,"Pay was good, workspace was adequate but trending down"
bad,Never go any help from leadership and upper management set up to fail from begining. Never got any support last 6 month my manager never spoke or email me.
bad,"This company consistently hires new people every year for the minimum amount of money, and fires (to avoid calling it a lay off) people who have been with the company for a while, in efforts to save money."
bad,"Management closes offices without looking at the impact, killing others work life balance as they have to pick up the slack, which makes your talented people leave."
bad,"A toxic management pool and poor d They routinely do mass hiring and then weed out the top earners with mass firings every year. "
bad,"Don’t get to comfortable in your job, for they are always laying people off work, just to make the company numbers.  I worked for the company 20 + years and was told my job was moving to new location 2 times so I did not have my job anymore.   That is the last time I will not go back, I will find a place that I can work hard and not go to work each day thinking if it is the day they will let you go.  "
bad,"Think of FirstData as a holding company.  They acquire new companies but are terrible at integrating them.  They have a lot debt and are working hard to bring it down.  But in doing so, they have cut down staff to a minimum so the numbers look good to investors.  The business side no longer has the knowledge and has to rely on IT for day-to-day functioning questions.  The company does well to promote military, women, and LGBT community."
bad,"Given the amount of debt carried by FD, this weighs heavily on employees who have neither the authority to make daily decisions nor are expected to move the ball forward that makes a difference in the market."
bad,"I've been in this industry a long time, and I can say this was the worst experience of my career. They expect total dedication. Like forget home and family..."
bad,"You won't ever speak with your manager and if you need to it will take weeks before you can get in contact with them. No room for promotions, extremely high turnover rate."
bad,"While working for this company I seen on a daily basis favoritism HIPPA violations and several other infractions that were never dealt with properly.  It was a very hard environment to work in.  It was not always like this only the last 5 years had it become such a bad work environment.  The benefits had changed to an HSA so if you had a family the out of pocket was extremely high, and making sure you had the money before you went to the dr was sometimes difficult."
bad,"the morale at FDC is horrible. Upper management does not appreciate the work of its agents. This company does not care for the agents like they use to. It's all about the money with this company. Never use to be like this before, until they got bought out."
bad,"If you desire to work for a company with a sound business model/structure, then this is not the company for you. Management is lazy and backwards, and tend to feel threatened by hard workers. It's possible that things are different in IT fields, but in terms of the client care organization, there is a lot to be desired. Health benefits are such a joke that they may as well be non-existent. The company does not do 401K match, so look elsewhere if this is a must for you. Layoffs are frequent, and leadership is constantly changing."
bad,This place was once a great place to work but management has become so bad. There is so much favoritism and they will fire you for no reason. They say they are flexible with school but it's almost impossible to get a decent schedule especially since it is a 24 hour place.
bad,"A typical day all depend on how the work is. I learned to work my hardest at all time. I know how to push out the work without being told. My management team is not the best. Some of my co-worker are team player, so the ones that are we push to do what we have to do."
bad,a good place in you are in management. As a worker no benefits
bad,"I have been in this company for 7 months now. It comes down to who you work for. I am working for someone who has no idea what he is doing, he puts his staff under the bus for personal gain. There is not clear definition of roles and responsibilities. Everyone is competing with you and they can put your under bus if that means their gain. Every division and department has its own agenda as if there is no senior management for the company. This happens at the top as well as junior management level. Corporate bullying is a daily event. DO NOT WORK HERE."
bad,"It used to be a great place to work before KKR purchase, now it's a sad shell of a company especially if you work outside of Omaha. Unfortunately the benefits now are the bare minimum. Only work here if you don't need real benefits"
bad,Work load kept increasing to the point that it could not be done well.  Everything was on a time crunch schedule and projects were required for which training had not been provided.  Required 10% overtime was scheduled into assignments but more was expected at all times.
bad,"Will not go back to call center representative, most stressful job I have had, now in production still stressful but definitely better than being on the phones"
bad,"It was very interesting in the beginning, however, six months in, i was looking for employment elsewhere.  I suffered for 2 1/2 years and i had accomplished nothing but wasted time."
bad,Work place favoritism is very VISIBLE. Room to grow is very limited. Managers are not on the same page when informing employees about office policies.
bad,"so many people have been terminated. many, if not all employees are doing the work of 3 people - 1 person is doing the work of 3 with out any more money. people are treated more like machines instead of humans. managers don't want you to talk only work."
bad,"not allowed pens, pencils, on floor, bed bug issue, not a family friendly place, accomidations were par at best. sometimes there is mandatory overtime."
bad,"high turnover rate, little support and resource constraint, poor work life balance, low compensation, no 401K match, value/compensate middle and senior management, low compensation for manager and below."
bad,"First Data is led by Sr. Leadership that enforces a policy with various exceptions. The difference between management teams is highly differential and unjust towards some of their employees. "
bad,"I'm guessing First Data is like many company's. The work/life balance, well, is not balanced."
bad,The company cares about hoe much money they can make and not about the customers or the employees.  I worked for First Data for 18 months and had 3 different comp plans and they progressively got worse and worse.  Deals that were approved for clients we later changed by First Data to charge the client more and more. I wouldn't notify anyone of the changes in hopes that they client wouldn't catch it. NOT how I do business so I left.
bad,"Management needs improvement and training on how to effectively lead their team members and operate a business department. Micro manage the employees that do not need and the ones who do not do their work, nothing is said to. Very discriminatory in some departments"
bad,"Good place to start your career but they put little value on talent in comparison to tenure."
bad,Unrealistic work load. The managers do not even understand how to do your job. Comany no longer has a 401k. Could not get any trainging when asked. Hard to get a day off.
bad,I would work there again as  they are on the leading edge of technology. The work schedule is flexible and they work with your family life as well. I like the challenge
bad,"This review is limited to my specific business unit in my location, which is marked by poor leadership, poor communication, and mistrust. Culture issues predate several rounds of layoffs and site closures"
bad,First Data is an extremely saturated company continously trying to resell their own clients through different type of alliances. Although there is the pro of making your own schedule you soon find that the company expects you to knock on doors daily and solicit businesses.
bad,"May start off good, but soon find out that the advancements are not there, raises are very small only %2, pay is low for the type of job techs do, and management with do what they can to throw you under the bus."
bad,"Each employee has to work 1 day of the weekend, company makes you work your day off when you have a bank holiday. Any holiday allowance you have you cannot take unless you book 6 months advance. They would still call you into work even if your mum died. You are just a number at this company dont take the risk."
bad,"Typical day clock in early and log into computer and start up different systems, open email, notepad, and have internet access to certain websites. Have to be careful because QA not only listens to phone call but what you website you're on. Have to read the script verbatum. Have to put up with customers yelling at you about why doesn't isn't my card working while I'm traveling out of state or on some weird website. They think FD is their bank customer service so there's some things we don't have the questions. Customers are especially rude on the weekends when  their banks are closed on the weekend and the bank customer service is not 24/7. FD call center is open 24/7. Report cards lost, stolen, compromised or not received. A lot of Spanish calls and people with really thick accents or old people who can't hear well. The hardest part is biting your tongue even when they're cussing at you & threatening to complain to their bank. First Data works for thousands of banks and credit unions but you're not supposed to tell them that because then they think you're a scammer or trying to steal their identity. Call centers in general have a high turnover rate and sometimes the pay is not word the stress or boredom."
bad,"I liked this company at first.  However,  once it was bought by KKR, it went downhill.  The only way u get promoted is if you have friends or family in high positions to help you advance. I don't recommend this company to anyone looking for long term employment.  Because they are known for just up and firing people.  It's very sad."
bad,"Working in Basildon at First Data, is not enjoyable to say the least. You do not feel secure at all, with 5 or more being sacked every week on average. For me the most enjoyable part of it was the people I worked with (not including management!) Management is awful there, being shouted at, on a daily basis and to answer calls when managers themselves sit on their phones. "
bad,Has a long way to go before executing on real sales plans for its employees. a great company for commoditized products but lacking in market share presence for new innovative technologies and products. No sales comp plans were ever put in writing from finance to my sales group in over a year. Two downsizes and re-orgs also resulted in no management for our sales team for over 6 months. company is cash poor since the IPO in 2015. there is also a zero expense policy. No marketing support or dollars- made it very challenging to execute especially against no set targets or goals.
bad,"The company has a lot of potential; however, it is very out of balance. Way too heavy in upper management. Middle management is understaffed and under compensated. The workload is unmanageable due to understaffing. A lot of internal turmoil that prevents the business from moving ahead in this fast paced industry."
bad,"This company is very cheap when it comes to raises. I worked there for many years and never received over .50 cent. They expect for you to make high productivity while working in different areas but will not grant you with an adequate raise for all your hard work. Also they make you work bad schedules such as many holidays (only closed Thanksgiving and Xmas) and your hours will vary. Most of the time you will not get 40 hrs a week , more like 30-35 hrs a week.  I feel like this company does not care about their employees but only care about their work getting done. The only thing I liked about this company were the coworkers. Other than that not much going on at this company."
bad,"Honestly, they treat their employees like garbage! Everyone is replaceable. You have no job security of any kind, your told to do one thing by management and the next day you're let go because it's some compliance issue. They look for any reason to fire people. You get minimum pay, and even with outstanding performance ratings, you get a very small raise if any at all. It's almost impossible to advance in the company, especially if you're in one department and trying to go to another to better yourself. You may have good management (though those are usually the first that they let go), but you're more likely to have horrible management. It's not a good work environment at all. If you're looking for a job, I'd recommend almost anywhere else besides here. The company goes more and more downhill every year."
bad,Although my last few years at FDC have created some bad memories I will always have one memory that remain and that is how much I have enjoyed the people that I work with.   I will be ending my career with FDC after 21 years due to an office closure that will take effect on 12/31/15.
bad,"Poor management, poor relationship and team work from sales team.  Poor overall culture. Looked good to begin with, but with the extreme work process with no recognition for your efforts and the unrealistic expectations, this is surely not a viable option for someone looking for growth and stability."
bad,International company going through many changes to try and create a more positive work environment. The culture differs from department to department.
bad,"The harder you work the less likely you are to be promoted, as you are making your managers job easier. those who are marginal and spend all their time talking instead of work will be the first one promoted. As they will promote off of friendship rather then work skills or abilities."
bad,I have worked for TASQ for nearly 10 years and have experienced alot and also learned alot. TASQ has been through alot of changes throughout the years. I have learned so much and was able to get promoted on a avaerge of every 3 years. Met many great people and lifelong friends. The hardest part of the job was the learning curves from the different departments. After the first promotion i learned the business more than just the job and hand and it made the transisition much easier.
bad,"A typical day at work was engaging in great conversations with my clients and making their issues seem very small while tackling the issues with a quick and swift resolve. "
bad,Horrible place to work no management. Dirty sales techniques. Hard to sleep at night at this place. Its all about company profits and the people that work for them are nothing but a number and a dollar sign.
bad,"The work load is a lot with training that is not great and unrealistic deadlines.  There are too many meetings in the work week especially around the reconciliations, with management that set goals that cannot be met.  There is a lot of stress to meet deadlines, management that is not helpful with training and workers that are over whelmed with transition from Denver to Atlanta.  Would not recommend anyone to apply for this position."
bad,"Great management, however insurance is expensive. I would like to move to a more secure company as they lay off frequently."
bad,"Things may have changed in the department at least I hope so!"
bad,The requirements and environment are like working in a poorly run kindergarten. Help is peer only.  Management Is more  concerned with watching every move than ability.
bad,"Call center work for any company is daunting. With First Data it is soul sucking. Many divisions are 3rd party departments meaning you represent another company and are empowered to do absolutely nothing for their disgruntled and demeaning customers. I had an exceptional manager but she was an exception to the rule. Leadership mostly stands about gossiping or evading even the appearance of work or simple questions from representatives. Most do not even speak and seem almost feral in their interactions with subordinates. People quit or are laid off frequently and the moral is abysmal. The only bright spot for me were a few outstanding coworkers that I was blessed to meet and the generous benefit package. With that said, if I had it to do again - I would give this company a hard pass."
bad,"Over worked, under paid, laid off to hire offshore to do it even cheaper. No bonuses. No incentives. No raises. No training. Management hired not for knowledge/ability, but friends and family benefits."
bad,It used to be a fun place to work.  Nepotism.  Leadership expects you to work overtime every day.  Compensation is low.  No retirement pension available.
bad,"Too many loyal, dedicated, and hardworking contributors are being laid off and no/minimal bonuses are paid our due to budget constraints while the CEO perks and PR initiatives are costly and ongoing."
bad,With financial struggles and trying to go public within a couple of years my time at First Data was stressful.  People were constantly looking over their shoulder wonder when the next reduction in force or terminal will be and who.
bad,"FirstData underpays their staff for what they do and what they expect from them. Management is on a constant power trip thinking they are able to treat their staff poorly. If you were late by a few minutes to start your shift they would deduct it from your pay, but if you were stuck on a call for over half an hour they would not give you the time back, just say ""oh well"". progression within the company is practically not realistic, there are employees in the company who have simply been there for years. Unless you move to a different department you are not going to be able to progress within the one you started,"
bad,"Raises sucked, no room for advancement, you could tell the upper management didn’t care. Site directors are great and had to work in very hard circumstances not being able to promote from with in due to losing the Rec and not backfilling positions. It’s hard to keep good people when you don’t promote from within"
bad,"As in many companies management will make or break your experience as an employee.  Difficult culture, toxic work environment.  Management looks the other way and allows a hostile work environment to flourish. "
bad,The management is horrible. No one knows what they're doing. Training was slow and they squeezed everything into the last week of training. The male managers are like pedophiles. No one communicates. The benefits were great. Good overtime from time to time. Horrible scheduling. First Data is very unprofessional!
bad,No culture with this company and continues down the road of doing more with less.  Annual and sometimes bi-annual layoffs.  Very small yearly raises if any.  The company is so large that the right hand doesn't know what the left is doing.  I did love working with my clients and being successful at keeping them current and happy.
bad,"nothing to say about anything :) i love my job and the people i work with . Love it  it i challenging, makes you think outside the box, good people who work hard."
bad,"The management was very bad at Alorica. "
bad,"There is a large disconnect between upper management and everyone under them. They're very unaware of what their employees face day to day and lack the empathy/communication skills needed to drive their employees. Morale is low and you can feel it all around you. VP's and up would benefit from gaining a true understanding of what their employees face day to day, so they know how to accurately drive the business. First Data is all about more with less, but they do not provide the the tools to make it happen. Instead, they continue to overload the people who work hard and expect them to operate at full power on everything they do."
bad,n/a busy place work is always available ...lots of different clients to work with. Options available to learn different things in different departments.
bad,"Not a good place to work. It was a referral from a friend. Not a good compensation package at all. I would not recommend it to anyone who is a hard worker,"
bad,"I use to love working for First Data, but now feels like executives are out to get the employees. The benefits are null, no 401K match, insurance is high and no longer allowed to work from home."
bad,I left the job because I wanted a change.  I worked for 2 people basically and felt I should be paid more. They have a high continual turnover.  I did learn about the banking/merchant customer service role.
bad,the only good thing about first data is the benefits and some cool people to work with. other than that the company is bogus. the management is horrible
bad,"They constantly want you to train and learn different areas but are not willing to increase pay. Seems that only certain employees must follow the dress code. Mandatory overtime was never mentioned in the interview or training class. Poor chances for advancement. Must meet numbers or they will have no problem with firing you. Unprofessional managment, but not all. Your phone calls must be perfect.. Quality sucks!"
bad,"There are very few companies that I would say to absolutely not work for, but this is one of them. There are reasons they have a high turn over rate for their customer service/merchant service representatives. It's a very stressful environment and it's not really an environment where you can grow or relax. As stated above, there is ""mandatory overtime"" which is not mentioned during the interview or training process and on several occasions you are not able to chose when you want your overtime and it is often tacked on at the end of your regular shift. This means working up to 6 hours straight with no breaks, and if you have to log out of your phone for any reason you are reprimanded."
bad,"At this company you are usually treated like another number. It does not matter how well you have done prior, it is what they expect and if you dont do this there will be repercussions. You get paid the same at all levels, some of which you take 12 calls per hour and another can take 2 and there is no wage change. The way the business empowers their employees is how you effect their business, never how it can effect you. Everyone is always looking for other jobs in the mean time and the labour turnover is insanely high. They simply recruit another batch every month to compensate.  Would not recommend if seeking career prospects."
bad,management needs a lot of work. Overly stressful do not do bank services account. Fire all managers to make first data great again. Also do not let managers get buddy buddy and focus more one on one with their teams to improve metrics.
bad,"Although we worked very hard to migrate projects on-time and within budget; the company itself was suffering from internal, corporate issues which stifled the earmark and allocation of project funds for many projects that were inflight or identified for funding in the coming year. "
bad,"First Data lays off entire departments, scores of people at a time for no truly viable reason. It is a tried and true tradition. The environment is contradictory to it's core values."
bad,"No job security"
bad,"When I started at FD in 2001, they still matched 401(k) contributions and paid some attention to employees' career progression and goals. However, that's all gone by the wayside now. The 'bottom line' is the only concern now. The only saving grace about my job now is the great people with whom I work."
bad,"I worked for this employer on 2 consecutive contract basis. After investing almost a year to this employer, they decided I was no longer needed after recalling me a second tenure. It is a stressful place to work and is not very sustainable employment."
bad,"Terrible work environment, very stressful job, with little to no support by Management and Leaders.  Also timing to get things done by IT was extended to a point implementations could take years to complete."
bad,The workplace culture was not good. There was a terrible work life balance. The management was horrible and unappreciative of the workers. I was not very satisfied working at this corporation at all.
bad,I worked for an incredible couple of members of management or would not have worked at First Data as long as I did. The limited benefits did not outweigh the stress and lack of any Pros to speak of.
bad,"-  Call center support"
bad,Flexible and dynamic working environment with the ability to be creative and offer out of the box solutions on projects and tasks while working within a metrics.
bad,"The group I was on had a great concept that was very poorly implemented. There was a lack of communication from management on a consistent basis. Myself and a number of my training class were put on an extremely difficult call que right from the start. The SME's were very helpful, yet it felt like management was only there to put you down."
bad,"My Manager forced me to resign when I was pregnant!  The atmosphere was nuts, full of crazy people who didn't care about you or the work and effort you put forth."
bad,Worked at First Data for  a copule years.. what a mess. Top brass pretty busy bragging about themselves and treat the regular employee like a penut.  to many cooks in management.
bad,"I had 4 sales directors in 1 year each had their own way of do things which was annoying."
bad,"Always at risk of being RIF'd (reduction in force). The harder you work, the older you are, and the longer you are there, your risk increases. When nearing retirement age there seems to be a larger risk; and, those with higher positions. Sad really, that you put your life into a company, only to be at risk of that tap on the shoulder. And, they won't let you clean out your cubical (which is only large enough to pull your chair out and sit down). In the 20+ years I've been there, with Org changes I've had at least 15 managers, and my cube has moved well over 20 times. No work/home balance whatsoever."
bad,"The work was good and you could learn a lot with cross training that is required. Working with the vendors can be a little specific according to their needs was the hardest part but, overall you are left alone to do your job."
bad,"the company needs some work"
bad,"First Data has diminished as a productive and enjoyable place of employment.  The purchase by KKR in 1998 and IPO in 2016 have continued to drive the work environment downhill based on focus only on cutting expenses.  Executive management does not support employees and continue to take any benefits away (i.e. personal days, 401k match, volunteer days, work from home).  Many have been laid off of left and are not being replaced leaving the remaining employees with impossible goals.  Work environment is very disappointing for a company that used to be an incredible place to work and support client's needs. Management needs to appreciate the knowledge and dedication of long time employees."
bad,"Use and abuse...Not a person just a number.  Clickish.  Like middle school.  Poor work environment.  Culture one sided.  "
bad,Training is limited in this company. I feel that the management did not take time with employees to fully train them for their jobs.
bad,"While I am appreciative of the additional skills I have acquired over the last four years, it is unfortunate that I can no longer build upon these skills. HR has a policy that will only allow you a 6% increase in pay, I currently get 10% in mandatory overtime, so no matter where I go I am always offered a salary of less than I am making. The management depends on your specific department, unfortunately I am in a department with a manager that is very hard to work with."
bad,"First Data has a reputation for firing people and then hiring new ones.  We hear about how many jobs are 'created' but only guess how many are lost.  It seems there is a Revolving Door policy...I feel sorry for HR employees."
bad,This would be a great position for an entry-level person looking to gain office experience; however there is no room for growth.  The work is not difficult although it can be repetitive so I would suggest one stay sharp throughout the day or night.  The are two shifts available to accommodate everyone as there is an endless supply of work.  I do believe depending on what it is that you do in the company the hourly wage should be higher that what it currently is.
bad,Best to avoid this company right now since the management is constantly changing along with compensation/job security.
bad,Generally good people. Poor mid level leadership. Problems persist following KKR leveraged buy-out. Very large but many problems. Don't waste your time and investment of your career.
bad,"FDIS bought out my previously privately held company.  Soon afterwards, they began laying off all my friends and spreading their work among those of us who were 'lucky' enough to keep our jobs.  No cost of living increases in over 5 years.  When I spoke up about it, I was set-up and fired for 'leaving the company premises on my break.'  Nice boss, huh?"
bad,"• Managing and motivating a team of 30 customer service representatives, with American Express, Sprint (Operator, 411 information), Bank One, Exxon - Mobile, and Gov One."
bad,Poor management
bad,"While I was there, First Data had a corporate culture of 3 major layoff events per year balance with a quarter spent rehiring. For a week after every layoff, productivity went down to nearly zero."
bad,Needs better direction.  Leadership does not recognize the staff.  Only looks at the bottom dollar.  Does not take time to really understand the work and people.
bad,"Not a company that is really interested in the employees.  Hire you and fire you at a drop of a hat. All they care about is their numbers. If you make the numbers, the numbers will keep getting higher."
bad,"Money was good, everything else they could of kept. Unorganized, stressful and chaotic aren't even the words that could best describe the work environment."
bad,"Great coworkers, I can't say enough about them.  They are happy and willing to share information with you to help you understand your role, which will likely take some time to learn.  Payments is a complex business and FD is a complex company."
bad,This company has no leadership that are in sync with the company’ Direction and now is going to get wore since fiserv bought them out. Many layoffs are on the way.
bad,I started at First Data in 1996 and in 2018 without any warning they called me to HR and said your position is eliminated effective immediately.  I had just received a good review about 1 month before. This is a very conmon practice at the company.  The raises used to be based on individual performance is now a percentage given to the dept to be divided.
bad,"This place was good to work at at first but what you'll notice real quick is that you don't have adequate support if you're having difficulty on a call. You aren't allowed to transfer calls to superiors if it's requested and they will sit there and let you pull your hair out with stress and anxiety instead of jumping in and helping. Non management were great, supervisors were alright but if you have any type of mental health issues keep it to yourself because you will get fired if you say you have anxiety like I said I did after a very difficult call that wouldn't have been so bad had I been able to escalate it to a more senior Rep. My manager at the time said that I could transfer a call if it got too bad but the next day when I came in for my shift I was let go. Please note that they say you are fully hired and don't have probation so me being fired went against my rights but I did  it pursue it. Overall it wasn't that bad but again, keep your personal issues to yourself, do your job and then go home."
bad,I did not like working here it was a job for income it was very under payed busy work you have to sort mail and you get very little breaks. It was not for me.
bad,"Most everyone at First Data has the attitude that it is no question that their role will be eliminated as your tenure increases. ""Not if, but when"". Poor upper management who have lost site of the customers needs. More important to sell than retain."
bad,"During a typical work week, one of my biggest tasks is checking in on my staff and assessing progress on various projects. I like to meet first thing on Mondays to discuss our priorities for the week, then meet again in the middle of the week to check progress, and once at the end of the week to discuss goal setting for the next week. I meet with smaller groups of my staff in the middle of the week to troubleshoot any issues. For example, during a recent mid-week meeting, I noticed one team was a few days behind on a long-term project. I met with the team and, together, we came up with a strategy for increasing efficiency. I also attend a weekly meeting where I present my department’s progress to the executive board. On Fridays, I make sure all tasks are completed and I've sent all the necessary communications via email and in person. Finally, I create a list of priorities for next week."
bad,the only review criteria is attainment of sales goals. 50 - 60 hours per week on an ongoing basis.  unreasonable sales goals when compared to sales opportunities
bad,"The company is more interested in profitability since going public. As long as one person is getting the work done, they ignore the fact it should be a 2+ person team. Insufficient compensation for the expected amount of work to be done. Depending on which area you work in, it's every man for himself. If someone can get ahead by demeaning their peers, they can and will."
bad,The company is very conservative and not employee centric. Comp and benefits are average at best. Not a dynamic environment or a fun place to work not much advancement
bad,Not a company that should work for if looking for updated technology.  Currently all are working on 4 / 5 year old equipment which is not capable of working on any job effectively
bad,I have come to care for my coworkers.  They are why I have stayed as long as I have.  The company is old in its ways using very dated methods of processing.  I have to fight to get us to use effective and efficient methods.  I often lose.
bad,Not a fun place to work at. Very regimented due to nature of application. The job was very heavy on paperwork and lite on coding. Pay and benefits below market average.
bad,The management is trying to save money by doing too much re-organization. They didn't realize that people who come and go could affect the knowledge and experience accumulated within the company and in the end it spends more time on training people and waste the investment. The management should have vision not short signed or re-organization per management change could hurt the business bottom line.
bad,Ok place to work. coworkers where very nice. Company not so much. Wouldn't want to work there again unless I had too. And then I would need to think  twice.
bad,"workplace culture,employees get alone well, team work, management constantly changing policies, management changes a lot. was a good place to work, while back, but its not the same any more."
bad,I loved my job I did ... It was a serious job handling consumers personal info ... However some of their hiring choices were horrible ... Simply horrible under qualified uncaring and simple minded ... I do blame that on mgmt ...
bad,First Data came to Louisville to take over processing from Bank of America.  They got some ideas from the Louisville crew and then closed the branch within a year.  Employees had the option of relocating to Maryland or losing their employment.
bad,"Although moving around the company is probable. Irrational expectations are set, and the lack of support makes it hard to complete the quoted task. Tenured colleagues are not respected either."
bad,Coordination between the teams and people can definitely be improved. Work structure can definitely be improvised. Working with other departments to stream line the priority needs to be improved
bad,"management has no regard for agreed upon terms in contracts."
bad,"The people are great to work with. Management and Quality agents would look for any excuse to fire you. The agents that you work with are great and very knowledgeable. I made friends their quickly. Only complaint is the upper management, rules and regulations that always seem to contradict one another."
bad,"There are only two positives about this job. One of those is the social side. You’ll meet tonnes of great people working here. The second positive is that it gives you the office experience to move on to a better job after a year or so. "
bad,"Learned a different industry, great manager, very informed always gave good direction, work culture normal, opportunity to add to productivity of daily processes."
bad,"Company seems to constantly go through re-orgs, and employees jobs changes like the weather along with their immediate supervisor. They have a great team of employees that work together to get things done despite management issues."
bad,"It was a very challenging to say the least, in that we had quotas to meet that were often unattainable. Many people worked on their accounts diligently in an effort to meet the assigned budget"
bad,I answered directory assistance calls before cell phones were widely used.  The most difficult part of the job was dealing with irate customers and learning to keep my calm while they yelled at me.  Talking to many of those customers which were friendly was great but learning to deal with the rude customers helped to show that I can handle stressful situations.
bad,This job is extremely fast paced. The hours can be changed quite suddenly and it is very intense. As it is so fast paced it can be difficult to meet all required targets as well as focus on your team.
bad,"CEO is a liberal jerk that wants cause segregation of different races and ethnicities at work vs. trying to integrate everyone.  He created special groups (Black Leadership, UNITY for LGBT employees, etc) that just creates issues.  Most people are laid off at least once in their career at FD with very, very few having the opportunity to actual retire from FD. It's always in the back of your mind that they will likely terminate you for no good reason, even when you have good job performance reviews and ratings."
bad,"I like the work, but the environment is bad and lots of negative, rude people. Management was the worst, bullying and shaming when you make a mistake."
bad,First data is a high pace environment with little return. It is a good entry position for anyone with a technical background or customer support background.
bad,It is a very concentrated and detailed. I've learnt how to manage merchants accounts. Management has a lot of room for improvement. The hardest part of the job was working very hard and feeling overwhelmed. The job did provided fun events that I participated in.
bad,"Biased and useless management without process knowledge managing process. Company is good but management is not approachable. If you are good with your manager then you will get increment irrespective of your work, capacity, efforts,"
bad,"Typical day at work consisted in visiting 2-3 bank branches were we got our leads. The main reason for visiting them was to try and convince managers and employees to talk to business owners about merchant (credit card) services offered by First Data & bank to take credit card payments from their customers."
bad,"My job as a Business Consultant work/life balance was good. As you work from home you set you own schedule - harder you work of course more money you will make; less you work; of course less you'll get paid."
bad,Great place to work with good people great environment and learned alot about checks and processing them took in coming calls and out going send forms
bad,"They should take better care of their employees. The job never can be done because we need other departments' jobs done in order to get ours done. My department needed to work 10-12 hours day including Saturday mornings, to finish assignments."
bad,First Data worked with some of the latest technologies in web development but they seriously lacked in promoting healthy work/life balance habits.  Also the management was completely disconnected from the day to day activities of their developers and staff.  They did not reward great performance however their CEO felt it necessary to obtain a 70+ million dollar bonus in the previous year.
bad,This particular site functions off of nepotism. Often you find yourself confronted with situations that would be considered unjust. The pay is minimal for the level of excellence expected. Promotions come too often for those undeserving. This should just be a stepping stone not a lifetime career.
bad,A typical at day at work consisted of read documentation from 1-100 plus detailed disputes. I learned how to work a dispute backwards and forwards. Management was okay but very political. I loved my co-workers they were the best part of the job. The hardest part of the job was to deny a claim. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet the clients needs.
bad,"Limited growth. not the best culture or opportunities......Not  too much to say .abcdekjhklh;kjk;l/vnmbmnb,mn,m/bmvnbmn"
bad,"typical fly by night call center, selling a mortgage exceleration  plan... which basically was making one extra payment per year to the mortgage thus resulting in your 30yr mrtg being paid off 6 or 7 yrs earlier"
bad,focused too heavily on incremental sales as opposed to net revenue. Poor communication from top to bottom. Great for work/life balance
bad,"First of all, don't even think you can get into management unless you are a former or current military member or spouse.  They literally will hire anyone for any management position, with experience or not, if they are former military.  This makes it extremely difficult for the rest of folks to aspire to be promoted up.  The top leadership in the company is like the good old boys club.  They like to hang their hat on their one token woman on the Leadership team, when in reality, she might as well be a member of the good old boys club too.  They will work you until you can't stand it and then ask for more."
bad,"did not like the position or the team leads were very immature, very rude and the pay i feel was not at midst for the work being done on a daily basis"
bad,"Excellent Sales Training designed to meet targets, great management, best part of the job - meeting new clients and forming new relationships."
bad,I learned a lot while working at First Data. I also met some amazing people. The hardest part about working there is you work so hard and it doesn't get noticed like it should. The are always changes things around and they never seem to get it right. The stress is just to much for most people. The do not make you fee like you are a valued employee.
bad,It was a typical job to work for and my co-workers were good. I learned alot in the little time I was there. The managment team was good with there employees.
bad,"it was fun for me to work in first data resource and I really like it "
bad,Employees here are unhappy for the most part but are too fearful to voice their feelings other than at the coffee machine.  The employees who are proven complacent lemmings get promoted to management positions eventually but any real advancement in this company is usually through cronyism and nepotism.
bad,at Wal-Mart we never has the help we needed to take care of the customers and i really didnt like that
bad,"I really could not say. I did what was required, but some people were there for the wrong reason"
bad,Very high stress on sales crew from management! Would not recommend.
bad,"Nice place to work, but no advancement. my boss was great. Pay not that great."
bad,"Latest CEO has all but destroyed a once wonderful company.  Employees are deemed a necessary evil, most all benefits have been cut to the bone, if they exist at all.  Employees are being laid off en-masse, and those not laid off are jumping like rats off a sinking ship.  Executive management continually makes mis-step after mis-step.  A classic ""how not to"" company.  CEO lacks integrity, poor leader.  Company future viability in serious doubt."
bad,"The job itself is not bad, very repetative but barable. Minimum wage. Managemenet were inexperienced and at times difficult to communicate with. Unwilling to hear anything but their own voices. Location was perfect, city center and east to get to. I was hired through an agency so job security wasn't there and there was no mention of advancing in the company. You could be given a new job title but it was the same pay rate. Co-workers were the only saving grace. Got me through the days with good banter."
bad,"Not much left to say. This place has lost all care for their employees... have taken away all benefits. Morale is very low, and it just doesn't stop."
bad,"Use to be a great place to work.  If I was looking for a job I wouldn't go there.  All they care about now is the bottom line and using as few people as possible to do as much as possible.  And if you are looking at a job for Denver, forget it, this office will be nothing but a call center in a year!"
bad,"Entry level positions are the best positions in this company, As you advance to other departments you have cliques that want you to brown nose in order to keep position... Never returns calls"
bad,Nice place to work but went out of business. Enjoyed the management team.
bad,"typical call center , large company great benefits , paid holidays off , not much room to grow"
bad,"I am not a call center person. Job was good, but not my what I was seeking."
bad,There are many opportunities to find your niche but make sure you have a solid mentor that is committed to helping you succeed. Lateral moves in the company don't come with commensurate training.
bad,"good opportunity to sharpen SQL coding skills and learn preeminent data warehouse architecture; coded eight hours per day, five days per week !  also good opportunity to learn different vendors' SQL database management tools."
bad,"Contractors should beware - when quarterly earnings were low, the furloughed ALL contractors.  While this is unusual, it is common for contractors to be furloughed during holidays (Nov-Dec).  "
bad,Training not all that is cracked up to be; forced to learn on the fly and no real explanations as to why procedures don't always work when they are needed.
bad,"work life balance is not there, also appraisal process is very week."
bad,"FDB overall is an ok company to work for. However, the job is extremely stressful and we are overworked and not praised for any good that we do. Promotions do not happen often and most moves mad within the company are lateral. Moving UP the ladder just doesn't really happen, especially in departments such as Editorial and DSG."
bad,Bad operational systems managed by outsourced companies and people. Poor work life balance due to poor systems and managers. Feel like employees are always expendable.
bad,"First Data is famous for its frequent layoffs, which typically affect the highest-paid representatives in each department, and are almost invariably followed by a hiring binge of representatives brought on at the entry pay rate. In addition, the management is incredibly unprofessional, and discipline is very inconsistent and often dependent on a team member's personal relationship with their direct manager."
bad,"The hardest part of the job is trying to help our merchant with system that do not talk to each other, departments that do not have the same type of sense of urgency that we have and the merchant expects!"
bad,The company has a negative vibe. It has a culture that according to long time employees was better when it was STAR. There is a huge disconnect because Omaha seems to be more important than east coast.
bad,"The pay is great, the people were great other than managers who have no idea how to do their own jobs. Not some place I would depend on career wise as you can be cut/booted in a heartbeat."
bad,"This is not a place where you pursue longevity or growth.  Decisions made by leadership put staff under undue pressure.  They are losing people left and right without backfilling as they should.  This leaves the remaining staff with unreasonable workloads.  It's very obvious the only thing that matters is the bottom line.  It's definitely not a place interested in developing people.  Also, I would not recommend them because it seems the ultimate goal is to ship all of the broken processes and work overseas anyway."
bad,"The work at First Data is and can be an awesome job. The job can be challenging and rewarding."
bad,She gave me the autonomy I desired as well as making herself available when I needed her assistance. I learned how to work with remote team members located globally.
bad,It is a weird company that it is hard to work and sleep at times barbecue you might not come back. The management is horrible and you can be let go for any reason. Not a good company to work for.
bad,"First Data has cut many benefits for regular employees over the last several years. However, they still offer many benefits to support the family, and career path."
bad,"Too much confusion on what is going on.  Pushing a product (clover) that is sub par with the industry.  Customer service and inside support was not there.  "
bad,The organization keeps changing and developing. New products are introduced to the market and large number of talented employees with great working ethics and result driven.
bad,First Data is what it is. It is a corporation that focuses on stock value and provides a decent place for people to work. I have alot of respect for my colleagues at First Data. They are exceptionally smart and solid workers.
bad,"Management continues to run the company poorly."
bad,"poor benefits, toxic environment, good mid level managers, executives only care about increasing stock prices, no respect for employees, no match ob 401k"
bad,"First Data is a Fin Tech company being run by NY big bank people. They have no common decency, and repeatedly lied straight to the faces of their employees."
bad,There is no money to be made there. The recruiters will tell you one thing and when you get there you will find out that's not true. The commission structure changes in a way where you can't make money. If you're not a Vet meaning have been there for a long period of time you can forget it.
bad,This company is trying to redefine itself .  They are routinely going thru restructuring and job eliminations in order to make numbers.  They have provided great work/family life balance.
bad,First data is a tough place to work.  Expectations are high with little management backing.  People are good hard working get burned out due to tome at work expectaions
bad,"Job used to have strong job security, no longer the case. Used to give good raises; we're luck to get raises now. Company is moving around a lot of pieces, losing good talented people to save money and show they are cutting debt down.  In the long run this will not be effective."
bad,Whilst on the phones you receive a lot of verbal grief daily from customers. The management structure is rubbish and the company policy's aren't nice to follow.
bad,"Did not take care of employees. Had mass layoff to save money. Short staffed, mandatory overtime, did not provide the tools to adequately preform job."
bad,"la empresa y filosofia son muy buenos,  pero en mexico aún no se alinean los dirigentes al estandar internacional,  La rotación de personal directivo y de operacion son muy constantes y sin bases definidas, mas que el criterio de las personas en turno, al instruir cambios de territorios o gerentes territoriales sin bases o sustento del negocio y entorno de mercado.  Una verdadera lástima"
bad,Horrible place to work felt like I was in a prison .Managers talked to you like you were nothing.Goals were impossible to reach.Not my type of job
bad,"A typical day at work would be to get 25 fraud cases completed in 1 hour as possible. I enjoyed what my position was but do not make any mistakes. The management frowned dearly on those. You was always documented all of your mistakes. It would have been so much better to learn from them, they never corrected or showed you how to fix mistakes. I enjoyed my co-workers. My Manager never came out of the office."
bad,"A Typical day was getting on the phones to collect on nsf checks. did both inbound and outbound calls. Management was okay! The hardest job is to locate customers that skip out!  Co-worker were okay, The most enjoyable of this job is to get payments plans going to help customers!"
bad,"I work from 8:00 in the morning to about 4:30 in the evening. Nice start to learning about supply chain logistics wanting to see more. Management has lots of challenges, lots of people either quitting or being laid off. People very nice to work with, the hardest part is it is very fast pace and sometimes stressful and frustrating. The nice thing is you do learn about banks and witch one to use and not to"
bad,"Have been working on FDC for almost eleven years. During all this time although getting great performance reviews every year, I have no carrer advancement opportunities. Management does not plan on development/training or helping mo move to better jobs with the company."
bad,"Cold calling leads to send to Business Consultants all day."
bad,"It seemed like a great place, great people, but with new mngt, everything changed. Major lay off's, cut benefits, no promotions."
bad,"First Data was once a great place to work, however the company is no longer the organization it was.  Layoffs and outsourcing have decimated the once great company."
bad,"Employees who have essentially grown up with the company all attest to the change in culture brought about with the change in executive management beginning July 2013.  Increased focus on producing more, spending more time in the office, being available after hours and on weekends, pressure to travel beyond agreed upon specifications upon hire.  Team members and fellow employees are great people to work with.  Management support is minimal, and thought leadership is lacking in the upper ranks from the VP to Executive levels.  Most enjoyable part of the job - working with employees who had spent their entire careers there and had been content with their mission and contribution up to this point.  Intensive focus on driving cost out of the business now, with little regard to preserving morale or employee satisfaction."
bad,"I started FDC about 2 years ago. It was my first corporate career jobs. The benefits were great based on my situation(no kids, no mortgage, etc.) The culture is very political. I learned alot. Advancement is possible but its all about who you know and who like you instead of you skills. The company is undergoing a reconstruction process and it moving pieces around, which account for layoffs. According to the trend that it is going, the company may go bankrupt in the next 5 years."
bad,"•	Handled entire Admin Activities for the project at Chennai and Bangalore."
bad,"The Company embraces diversity. It also gives preference to internal candidates, though it does not seem to be always based on education or experience."
bad,"Work with several different debit networks on a daily basis. Work independently to resolve daily issues on the follow networks, pulse, interlink, AFFN and ATH. My technical skill includes the use of FSAM, MSA, Client-Line, and Mainframe. Also, work with the following internet software Pulse, Visa, AFFN, and Star to process debit adjustments, Pre-arb’s and chargeback’s."
bad,"Reshuffle team, areas and resources constantly.  Love my job and some coworkers.  FD is know for being a resume pit stop- long term growth there is a oxymoron."
bad,Run!! Bank Partners are not bought into your success of the partnership. You will be better off at another company with less operational tasks and better compensation for the work you do!
bad,Good company with benefits but very little advancement. Management will not reveal long work hours beforehand. Worked on project where it was out-of-hours meetings were mandatory and occurred during weeknights and weekends.
bad,"There is very little structure when it comes to getting an issue resolved. The people are nice enough; however, no one seems to ""own"" any processes and tons of red tape and waiting on approvals.  There seems to be no SLA from most departments except for us (the sales reps)"
bad,"I didn't get the opportunity I thought I deserved, I enjoyed working there and really liked the people I worked with. the management did not give the young people responsibilities and didn't have an opportunity to grow."
bad,"I would not recommend working here as the managers are cruel and unfair, they favourite certain members of staff  and pay no attention to others. There is no work and home life balance especially if you work the late shift as you enter work around 12;30 and sometimes wont leave until 9:30/10:00. If you work Sundays you will only handle around 3 calls in 7 hours, this gets rather boring so mangers often send employees home and force them to make up the hours. Overall it is a boring and unsatisfactory place to work.would not recommend if you want to keep your sanity."
bad,"Receiving inbound calls to help merchants with their equipment. Call center style environment with 1,000+ employees. High turnover and environment different depending on department."
bad,"Work wise, you work with people of similar interests and makes the job worth turning up for but due to poor management and lack of care for staff in the long run, the staff turnover rate is high for a reason"
bad,"First Data in Australia is going downhill fast. Management and Support are being offshored to India, with the erosion of relations with customers. Ongoing redundancies have led to good people quitting the company. Services such as Finance and Payroll have been offshored as well. "
bad,If you want a steady job with job security and a good chance for advancement move along to a different employer. For the work and security involved the pay is low and the longer you are employed the more likely you will be laid-off in cost cutting measures. There are some great people working there but they are leaving.
bad,Not a good idea to be a part of this company. Turned into a call center environment. I recommend that you look at other options before choosing this company for a career path
bad,"When I first started working for the company, everything was pretty well, but as the years went by and the changes in management, the place turned into a high turnover rate facility with people being laid off from their jobs every couple of months.  It's became clear that it didn't matter how long you've been with the company, if your position was no longer needed then they was eventually going to let you go or try to relocate you somewhere else."
bad,The company often has hiring freezes which make it hard to difficult to get promotions.  The company does not offer cross training that would allow employees to gain knowledge or experience that would make the promotleable.
bad,"It was very stressful to work here.  Things would change all the time, often with only a few minutes notice.  We had to deal with angry merchants because things were more complicated than it needed to be."
bad,"Senior management excellent at articulating keywords and current business and IT trends.  But, mostly clueless on what those keywords mean and how to implement them. Inconsistency is the norm."
bad,No structured way to progress and no structure to offer personal development. Staff near the bottom of the scale for pay receive a non competitive/low salary and the rest of the benefits package does not make up for this shortfall. This leads to a very high staff turn over rate.
bad,only brief contract - 3 months. Their IT system was so slow it led to frequent interruptions and downtime in work processed. One manager felt the need to belittle temp staff.
bad,"Working at first data was fun. So many nice people to talk to while you’re in the office."
bad,"I would review agents calls, score calls based off of soft skills and rules set by bank guidelines, provide feedback and goals to accomplishment, train on new procedures, meet with management with progress and corrective action plans. "
bad,"Good Products and services. Lacks Employee friendly environment"
bad,"there no job security at first date, and strike schedule hours with less or no benefits, stress full management teams and luck of communications with stuff"
bad,"Department was very understaffed, management didn't seem to offer any relief for the fact that more and more responsibility was added to the workload of the employees and the standards they set were unrealistic."
bad,"I feel the need to list the Cons here in the Review, because they're predominantly how I feel about the company."
bad,I learned a lot about what goes on durring a transaction. The people I worked with were nice and I enjoyed they're company while not on the phones and they were helpful if i had any questions. But getting yelled at constantly by clients is what ruined it for me. my anxiety levels were very high because of it. It was to the point that thinking of work made me want to puke.
bad,"I enjoyed my time at First Data, they have some great people there. But the management there let the company down and with the treatment I was given I wouldn't recommend them."
bad,Great place to work for the area that it is located in.  Many different departments to choose to learn and grow.  Doesn't offer much room for advancement once you reach exempt level.
bad,Look out for yourself. Terrible pay- long hours for close 8 am till midnight first 3 days of every month. If you need a job then fine. If you don't it would not be my first job to go to unless you absolutely hate where you are.
bad,"I have been with the company for over 5 years.  Our current leadership team is concerned with becoming profitable to go public.  There are several lay-offs every year and high attrition rates.  There are pros and cons with every company, but First Data has more cons for me personally."
bad,"I can imagine a First Data that rivals Google as an awesome place to work. It has the potential to inspire innovation, and challenge its talented employees. The managers I’ve encountered have great dedication, integrity, open mindedness, and are great leaders. The people I worked with were intelligent, experienced, and hard working."
bad,My last manager was ineffective at motivating her staff.  Company treats their employees poorly by reducing pay and benefits.  Very strong in the Payments Processing Industry with a good reputation with clients.  Products and services are excellent for business clients.
bad,"If you are an intelligent person who is looking for a company who can give you the proper tools and management look elsewhere. There is no accountability for anything. People are promoted based on who you know , and not your ability."
bad,"my days are about processing work, sending out transmission and meeting deadlines."
bad,"A simple data entry job, however, the assignment was unstable and ended quick. "
bad,if you don't mind sitting all day and taking phone calls this is a decent place to work
bad,Management tends to work out those with significant time in First Data and/or those making a hefty salary and/or those reaching middle age.
bad,"The culture is antagonistic towards delivering a quality product, on time, and within budget. If these goals are not met, which is often the case, no one is held accountable particularly if you can document why the project goals were not met. Consequently, employees spend more time on C.Y.A activities, than on efforts to do great work."
bad,"started out promising, but the overall company culture was terrible.  people weren't terribly honest about the job duties after they changed from the initial posting."
bad,"First Data has interesting products that power commerce.  The company is mostly run by former bankers, though, rather than technology leaders.  First Data had many good people but unfortunately the culture was poor, in part due to consistent layoffs and a subpar benefits package."
bad,"First Data is a great company to work for if you are in the right department and a have a good supervisor who understands the position.  There are many perks worst part is the layoffs, no 401K match and you have to pay back tuition reimbursement if you leave the company within 1 year of completing classes. Lots of volunteer opportunities."
bad,The more you work just means the more you work. Their raises are terrible AND they have a cap now on levels of advancement. I'm sorry but if a candidate is worth it they should be able to be compensated. Basically do not kill yourself on basis that you are promised more as it will not happen until you tell them you are leaving.
bad,was very hard on anything that was not fully detail orientated . Upset on anything that was not fully job related.. did not like employees to enjoy working--no comedy for relieving possible stress..   Team management was not there all of the time to assist in questions regarding merchant reques
bad,"805 Crown Point Omaha"
bad,I usually arrived 20/30 minutes early.  Review calendar to check on vacations/FMLAs.  Check for call in sick messages.  Build operator schedule assignments.
bad,"My Creative team was the best I've had throughout my career."
bad,"During my time there, his company experienced many C-level & culture changes including major layoffs/RIFs which greatly impacted morale.  Prior to KKR, this company was a great place to work."
bad,"First Data constantly laid off people thru out my 17 year career."
bad,"Typical day at work consists of being short staffed, not being paid competitively, and consistently 'asked' (told) to do more work without proper compensation. The work environment is cut-throat to stay above the chopping block due to lack of job security. The most enjoyable part of the day is going home."
bad,"Numbers driven corporate culture that preaches ""Genuine Concern"" for the client but will fire employees who do not hit their quotas regardless of leads generated from primary lead source.  Merchant market is saturated with competition.  Referral partner makes all the difference.  Decent salary, short sighted management, insufficient training, high turnover."
bad,"when you first begin at first data you begin training, our training group was not trained properly and was misguided. then when your actually on the floor, the staff can be rude, snicker behind your back and make you feel low. the customers on the phone can be very unpleasant. and if your having an unfortunate even or situation at current life, the manager depending who it is does not appear to care at all. if you have mental issues they do not adapt to how you need to be treated. however their reward system is the only beneficial thing form the company.  the coffee and cafeteria is also extremely expensive, and the coffee machines often take your money or are broken."
bad,"Not a bad job, management is good. The only issue is they make a lot of promises and rarely follow through. I would definitely suggest start making friends in high places. Other than that it's impossible to get anywhere."
bad,"Was hired as part of a newly created team only for the team to be totally eliminated 90 days later.  First data has no loyalty to their employees, only the bottom line dollar sign!"
bad,"answering phones, processing mail,talking with"
bad,"My coworkers were wonderful. The management needs a reality check by working the phones with their employees for a few days. Making the monthly required numbers, though I understand the need, is difficult and they are inflexible. It's 8 hours being told how awful the company is, how awful you are, and very limited concern on the part of the employer. Learned many different computer systems to use but received little to no compensation for all of the work required in using them. My coworkers were the enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"When I started at first data I was told I would be doing 4 weeks of training. I felt like the training was a bit of a unorganized mess. The staff are friendly. I no longer work here as it just wasn't for me. If you can deal with computers and answering phone calls, it's not a terrible job."
bad,I worked there for 31/2 years and I still felt like an outsider to most of the people I worked with.  This made getting any work done when you had to rely on others for help.
bad,Be ready for constant change and senior management who is out of touch with what the business really needs.  You are just a number and experience in your position means little to nothing.
bad,"Management is distant, cliquish, constantly changing objectives and never supports their employees.  Human resources have a high turnover rate and more concerned about diversity and frequent layoffs.  this company is a puppy mill for employees and am sorry I ever invested money in them."
bad,"While I was there they had this absurd way of managing staff with layoffs.  You'd work for nine months, get laid off, then find out they were posting an ad for you job three months later.  That's not a way to manage labor costs.  From that standpoint, they suck.  I don't know they still practice that garbage but beware. (BTW, it wasn't just me, most of my section was laid off, rehired later.)"
bad,"Went through at least 3 leaders in my last 8-12 months. All had differing opinions on strategy and management.  Challenging for anyone who wanted to do a good job as you never knew what other view of ""good"" was."
bad,"It was good the first few years then things started getting toxic and stressful; too many changes in a short time, lost direction of where to head, lots of layoffs and people leaving on their own. unstable environment."
bad,"When I first started at First Data there was a great culture and back office support staff.  After going public, the company stopped caring about their sales force.  They decreased back office support, and lowered compensation across the board.  There was no longer a clear direction that the company was moving in.  No 401k matching and stock options which required long tenure in the company.  "
bad,"This WAS a great place to work, good pay, great benefits. But then the company was bought out by KKR and they have turned the company into a terrible place to work.  The Corpus Christi location will be closing its doors in the next few days."
bad,Enjoyed the people i worked with. Benefits were good until they were recently changed. They provide tuition reimbursments for college.
bad,"I learned a lot about multi tasking!"
bad,"Worked as a consultant, Manager was located in office in another location. Communication and expectations were not clear."
bad,"My two star review is the result of a) too much pressure to learn WAY too much in 2 weeks in training; b) the lousy pay for the 60+ hour effort your have to do to sell Clover successfully; and c) Management did not back me, a BC up vs. a boisterous and antagonistic small wares mgr who wore through 7 previous reps and I spoke Spanish to the majority who where Spanish speaking; but that didn't matter. You see, after kicking out a previous BC, she asked for him  and management coalesced?! But why? Why pays for the Clover Station inside the Restaurant Depot's? FD DOES!!"
bad,Overall not a bad place to work for. Management was not really involved with the projects at that time. They were more worried about the office politics.
bad,The company has moved to a table work environment. All cubes are being replaced with tables. Horrible work experience on a daily basis if you need to get any work done. Even the SVP level sit at tables.
bad,great benefits horrible management  has cafeteria and ping pong free gross coffee. Mangers don't care about the employee and very fast pace training is short so you learn everything as you go
bad,"busy and fast paced technology company, that handles IVR's very progressive team. Many deliverables that required a lot of tem collaboration, often working with other teams globally."
bad,"I thought it was quite interesting that they had such influence on their employee's an the outside business world. This company, statistically speaking is one of the nation's leading trendsetters in this field. Surprisingly enough, they are not a household name when it comes to companies that the common citizen would reach out to or research. This is a single known fact in the corporate world, unless you are a household name, you have yet to impact your surrounding an your world."
bad,There are not many friendly people and the environment is very hostile. Work was stressful and ever changing with the requirements given to us. Higher management was not properly organized.
bad,First Data acquired Bank of America (BA Merchant Services) and I continued my role as Operations Team Manager Loss Prevention/Fraud Investigation.  Seamless transition from Bank of America over to First Data.
bad,this job has a great culture and excellent training program. the management is ago half and half meaning some managers are good and some are not overall good company.
bad,"Good place to work, "
bad,"First Data did not offer much advancement for everyone.  I felt that they had their ""favorites"" and chose to focus on helping them move up."
bad,"It matters what building you work in for overtime. Nice coworkers. Most of management helpful and polite. You do not get fired for mistakes, unless you make a lot of them. And don't care about them. Easy work but you have to concentrate on your job. Pay is ok to good I guess. Thy have 401K, but no match, you get stock."
bad,It was an interesting place to work where the bosses aren't on your shoulders all the time.  But the salary wages and increases were very little.
bad,Silo-ed company that lacks innovation and values process versus outcome.  The company is saddled with debt and this impairs the company's ability properly invest in business lines across the company.
bad,"your co workers help you deal with difficult customers however we had been given a weeks worth of training out of four weeks, to then be put live on the phones with out hardly any training. I found this was very unprofessional and made my own health deteriorate due to the lack support."
bad,"Fun work place with supportive management. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues. "
bad,"Everyday is a different day with new challenges and changes"
bad,"For the time that I was at First Data I was fortunate to have good management. My direct manager always had an open door policy and worked at developing my career,"
bad,A typical day at work for me would be punching into the time clock.Proceed to finding a Manager to ask what work area would I be working in for the day.I would proceed to the area and do my job.I learned how to scan documents on a scanning machine. Management could have been better. The company was very diverse so I enjoyed learning about the different ethnicity from my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was working on mail machines that worked poorly and with this being a productive job. You had to meet productivity numbers so that was frustrating with the machines not working properly. overall i enjoyed my co-workers very nice people.
bad,"Lots of nice people, but zero communication with my contracting company and I was underpaid for the duties I performed."
bad,When I first joined I would have given the company 4 stars but since that time they have reduced benefits including taking away the 401K match.  They have also cut back on many of the perks and other benefits of working with the company.  Moral is very low as they laid off an office last year and are about to lay off another office this year reducing the number of employees and putting many out of a job.
bad,"Company has been absorbed by into First Data's Western Union subsidiary and change from privately owned to public, was very telling in the managment attrition and staff turnover."
bad,See Previous Review.  Not an employee oriented company.  Treated employees poorly.
bad,"My typical day would be spent generating new web screens for mostly state clients.  I would create banners, buttons, etc. as well as I may be asked to come up with an all-over branding for the site.  As a Business Analyst I would work with the clients to determine the business needs as part of the project team.  Basically the first line of communication between the clients and First Data.  At one point I was also working as a Client Services Representative assisting clients on the phone or web with questions or issues they may have with the company's AuthentiCare product."
bad,"In order to take a bathroom break, you had to hold up a sign that said ""unscheduled"" and they timed you while you were in there. "
bad,90% on the phone. Able to resolve customers' problem in good time. Co-workers are helpful. Learn t how to fix different terminal and equipments.
bad,To meet the daily target whilst maintaining 100% quality.
bad,the job was very stressful at times but the end results were what counted
bad,"From the start there was a lack of honesty about the company and its employees. Their selling pitch is One First Data as they offer stock ownership as soon as a year of being hired on. It is also suppose to make you feel like you matter that you have a say on what is going on. However, this is not true. "
bad,"Its really obvious that the upper echelons of management do not care about anything other than lining their pockets. Furthermore, applications and environments are also really half baked and managed by morons. Getting anything done is extremely painful."
bad,its hard work there is no give way they are very by the book and every thing changes everyfive minutes traning sucks. they do for some that they don't for others.
bad,"Beware of working for this company, they are known for their layoffs, terrible management!! My whole department was layed off.  It started with my manager who was the only good manager at First Data, then they started laying off the rest of us.  I found a new job before I was let go."
bad,"great culture, bad management and leadership. Benefits have got worse, pay more out of pocket for health insurance and no 401k match. unstable work environment lot of layoffs."
bad,This was a good company to work for. The people was wonderful and very understanding when it comes work.
bad,Many great division. Large company with stable growth and profits.
bad,"Fentastics co workers and office. The experience of working with all collegues was too good and unforgetable. Have leaned a lot from all of my mets and also helped them to get learned from me what i known about."
bad,A First Data representative you are calling on small business owners to improve their credit card merchant services and to establish a relationship with SunTrust Bank. The hardest part of the job was balancing the time required to solve customer issues and time finding new business. It is very high pressure sales and quotes and it does pay very well.
good,This job was interesting...I felt like I worked alot and really didn't benefit a whole lot.  I did learn about loading gift cards and completing a lease buyout. Management here was very adamant about the numbers...this was the main concern.  Everyone pretty much kept to themselves because we were busy all the time.
good,"The culture in my organization was very secretive, though senior leaders preached about transparency, and that's exactly how management style rolled down to the lower managers."
good,"I like doing call center work at this job. I learned a lot about dealing with Western Union money orders. Working on this job was pretty easy for me. I received inbound calls checking money order numbers to see if they had been cashed. If it had been cashed I would explain how to get a copy of it to see who cashed it.hadn't been cashed, I would explain to the customer how to get a refund. The pay could have been better."
good,"I've been with this company since January 2017. After working here for nearly 6 months I'm already uninterested. I honestly come to work because it pays some of the bills. There's little to no opportunity for advancement. It's the ""good ole boy"" system here! you either must have an inappropriate relationship with someone, or have a good friend in certain places to advance. the diversity in the company is mediocre, while there's plenty of opportunity to build moral. First Data has a wonderful reputation within its industry as a leader, but treats their employees as totally disposable and the compensation is not competitive at all for the market."
good,I was released for making a minor mistake after returning from a 3 month medical leave. the error cost the company only 81 dollars to rectify and they let me go.
good,Nice place to work. Has a fast work flow and a lot of multi-tasking. Enjoyed time working here.
good,"Was not a bad company to work for,benfits are good. people were nice, some managers were good ones. I learned alot of information about the credit card and banking world. I loved my job"
good,"First Data is an innovative, global company looking for talented individuals interested in joining a team of experts who are shaping the future of global commerce."
good,"No one knows who is responsible for contract sign ups. As a phone Rep, 90% of your calls will be someone yelling at you. The pay does not add up to the verbal abuse you are expected to deal with. Your calls are viewed but nothing is done about the Sales Reps signing merchants into contract under the impression they are getting some sort of deal. Monthly meetings to go over how much money they are bringing in makes you feel like a slap in the face compared to what you are paid. Management will smile in your face and gossip behind your back. Friends promote friends so dont count on your manager promoting you. Yearly raise might be $0.10."
good,"aging product suite if not on the Merchant/Acquiring side of First Data.  Data and information not decentralized on multiple platforms makes them ripe for competitive takeover, unhappy clients, unhappy staff."
good,"My manager is a great guy, but the company has a revolving door of reps that come and go quickly. Goals are increased 40% yearly. Company is now public, so if you want to work for corporate America and not looking for something long term, this would be a good fit."
good,Their inability to do what is right for the company plays second fiddle to the “politics”. The powers that be have no are clueless when it comes to making the right decisions for the company and servicing the merchants.
good,"My first few years were wonderful.  Our group had a great manager who went out of her way to give recognition to those who performed well and offered non-judgmental feedback when something wasn't working for the group. She was eventually ""phased out"" and her replacements got worse each time there was management turnover. "
good,"First Data no es una mala empresa, sin embargo ahora que es corporación ha habido muchos cambios que ha desmotivado al personal y estamos en busca de otras oportunidades."
good,"Is been a long time that I worked for this company. My typical day was running reports to set all employees on their daily task. Intensive telephone worked contacting debtors for payments and doing skip tracing. Intensive bulk mail, sending payments reminders. notices and invoices. Following up with Attorneys on debtors judgments. Keeping track of all payments and receivables. Training new employee."
good,"Work could be intense and varied from little to high call volume. I learned more about myself and patience while dealing with merchants, co-workers were helpful."
good,Sorry to say the company is going under.They have a lot of people and very little work to go around; However I do enjoy what i do..
good,"long days, i loved my coworkers, not alot of room for advancement"
good,a good job for someone who does not like to deal with phones. I did data entry all day long and was able to listen to my headphones
good,"Unfortunately, the management seems to sit back and the team members are run off their feet. Poorly"
good,"Great place for veterans and LGBTQ community. Other than that not a fan of this company. Politics mainly. If you aren’t popular, being a suck up or having an affair with someone you can’t advance in this company."
good,Company diversity needs to be improved need to recognize all cultures.  Typical day clock in and start you work for the day sign on to your computer and pull up your task to work.
good,My typical day at work was covering projects and lately working on resolutions for client with IT team. I worked well with my colleagues and across departments trying to help the client. hardest part was achieving resolution through IT on issues. I enjoyed it when there were certain items I could go in and resolve to help the client. I thoroughly enjoyed working with all my colleagues and immediate managers throughout the years. Can't say I had one I did not feel comfortable with. The hardest part was wondering when layoffs would happen if affect me. I
good,First Data was supposed to be a full time permanent position but it ended up being temporary and I had to find another job with short notice. I learned how to assist customers with tax payments and questions they may have had about different ways to prepaire there taxes
good,The entire center has a culture of micromanagement and does not allow for thinking outside of the box and cultivating an atmosphere of  expanding and growth beyond one's comfort area.
good,"A typical day would be doing the same thing over and over again. "
good,"Long hours, not enough resources. Company is starting to outsource their workforce. Opportunities to learn the card service industry and to apply advance Excel skills."
good,Late sitting. too much of pressure.no job security only salary is good.pick up drop facility is available from thane station.if you want to join then join on company payroll not on third party payroll
good,This job was a dead end sales job for a local office associated with the First Data sales channel (Ignite Payments). The commission structure changed many times to the benefit of the local owner.
good,Work your butt off for a 3% yearly raise... Maybe. They don't match at all on 401k and justify it by giving stuck every few years that doesn't even vest for three more.
good,"The benefits started off strong, and got progressively weaker every year.  They don't treat their people well.  Mandatory over time, zero tolerance policy for even 1 minute late clocking in, not a healthy work environment and no meaningful discretion given to managers at any level."
good,Benefits are garbage. No 401K Matching or bonuses. Medical is expensive and useless. The network and systems we use are unstable and slow. Management doesn't care about your time. He only likes you if you work on your days off which is weekend and and put in 50 Hours a week. There not thankful for that or get rewarded in a way.
good,"First Data pays well, but that's about as far as the perks go. There is no matching 401(k), minimal advancement, no raises if you are a manager or above, and job security is thin."
good,"I worked for First Data for 18 years.  I enjoyed the work, the people and the culture most of the time.  I always had pretty good reviews and a successful career there.  However, the meritocracy system makes the work environment VERY competitive and I felt constant pressure to compete/perform or lose my job.  When you feel as if you are constantly fighting to keep your job, it makes it difficult to free yourself up to do a good job.  Also, from the upper management perspective, everyone is replaceable and I rarely felt like the company valued my expertise.  The sales team had loads of turnover -  if they did not make numbers they were gone..."
good,"amerikanischer Führungsstil, unsicherer Job, dunkle Großraumbüros, viel Druck und stätige Veränderungen der Aufgaben machen das leben schwer"
good,employed there 16 years  co workers great group   poorly managed job security was not something they take seriously  I learned a lot of the customer service end of the business
good,The Chargeback Department takes more than plenty of my time during a day. We are required to constantly work overtime leaving no time for family life. It would be nice to be paid a better amount and work decent hours. I have learned to not take anything personally the customers are more frustrated at the situation than what we are able to do for them as far as the co-workers it is decent but it is not like we have time to talk.
good,Good work environment. Very low compensation. Management is not very good. Co-workers are great. Overall a good work environment.
good,Hard environment requires many hours. There is not much documentation about the applications.Many tasks are on the fly.
good,"Good Co-workers just bad communication on the job, I learned that communication is the key without that things won't work good"
good,"First Data was on the brink of self destructing when the new CEO took over. "
good,The work environment was very uneasy and stressful. Managers were also unapproachable.
good,"Typical day at work was phones, phones and phones.  I learned how to deal with different types of people."
good,"Compensation is above average and plenty of work to do.  "
good,"I enjoyed by job every much, always learning,coworkers were a family, management had high standards sometimes, too high, hardest part of my job was showing someone else how to do by job knowing I would be laid off."
good,The team at First Data lacked communication skills which made it an unpleasant place to work.
good,You could help multiple customers and they would even ask to tell your manager. That changes nothing. All that matters is you fix the customer's issue in 5 minutes or you fail QA.
good,Used to be a good company in terms of work environment. No job guarantee. High expectations. Management can get better. No late back charges in case of excessive work days.
good,"When started there was a culture of helping and asking for ideas which eroded after the first two years to don't say anything, do your job, or you will not be there.  There are good people there but the corporate culture has declined."
good,"The exposure to enterprise equipment was a welcomed advantage that I am very grateful for, however, the culture at FDC is one of every man for himself and very little family orientation."
good,"Not very Productive and DID not allow or encourage Work From Home even after working late night hours. Projects that included working late nights, you were expected at the office at the same time in the morning."
good,"Economic downturn and poor leadership after the company was take private lead to massive layoffs and constant reorganizations, loss of key personnel and focus."
good,"From start till end the calls are continuous and every call is different which is sometimes challenging but I enjoyed being challenged and learning from each call."
good,"I worked there for about 15 years...when I started it was great Family and team oriented. You moved up, you were encouraged to excel...After numerous bad Executive Level hires with inflated signing bonuses and huge contract buyouts, FDR was taken over by KKR who continued to make bad management decisions & changes...the place tanked...People with no technical experience were given management jobs over engineers and administrators with years of experience and valuable knowledge..."
good,A stable place of employment. Healthcare benefits were below industry standard during the time I was employed.  The company is always in need of employees and constantly hiring.
good,"First Data is all about meeting numbers for their shareholders. This means understaffed departments, long hours, and often very little support. Furthermore, the benefits are below industry standards. No 401K match, bonuses are small if any,  and if given are 50% in stocks that may 4 years to vest."
good,"This is an organisation that could be brilliant if it wasn't for meddling incompetent American management. Exeter people were great, company has a massive impact on it's customer base - just won't invest, forward think or care for its employees"
good,"I loved what I did for my job at First Data, and was very good at it. I thought that management would fight harder to get me back in after a Felony Dui Conviction. They kept giving me the run around. Even though it was just from Driving Under Influence it was consider a Felony Charge since it was my Fourth One in over 30 years. I caught on to all the steps in accomplishing my work in a timely matter. I loved the people I worked with, and they loved me to. I miss them."
good,"Not a bad place to work for a while when you move to town or if you wish to begin working in Manufacturing.  A typical day happens on your feet for 8 hours and working on a machine attempting to get it to run efficiently.  This does not always happen but it is always the goal of your work.  I've learned a lot about doing your best in limited situations.  Management at the middle level is very effective and well done but the higher management seems aloof and disconnected from the day to day operation.  The hardest part of the job right now is limitations on machine operation imposed due to limited replacement parts and a dwindling staff of technicians.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me, was always when able to get the machine humming and putting up good production numbers."
good,"Job Security was always threatened, company does not reward their best employees as they should, the typical raise per year if any was 2%. The one great thing about the job is that the work environment for the most was not very stressful."
good,I was laid off with the company at Christmas. It appears that they have a layoff around this time every year. The manager that I was under had no direction and guidance of the position of the staff.
good,"First Data is a fast pace environment.  Leaders of the company do not value their employees, those with year of dedication get paid 10-20% lower than the new employees"
good,"Not a place to make a career if you enjoy sales. Comp plan changes drastically on a yearly basis, when company needs to reduce costs they target the revenue generators of the company the sales force by shrinking the comp plan or making it harder to attain happy/competitive goals."
good,Lay offs and chaos. Great co workers. One must be able to adapt to frequent change and lack of direction. Frequent changes in leadership. Ability to change directions at a moments notice. Average benefits. I enjoyed my internal clients very much.
good,"I work with Information Technolgy Tools, Data, Reporting tools, MS Office and UMO Oracle. I have learned Business Management through providing monthly metrics to the company and clients. The workplace is hostile. There is no hard part about the job. I enjoy measuring the performance of the departments, the company and clients by providing Key Performance Indicators and metrics."
good,A typical day at work is extremely busy with not enough time in the day to complete the amount of work needed to stay a float.  The good thing is working at FD will prepare you for any type of stressful position that require attention to detail and deadlines. The people are the best part. Lots of family oriented folks.
good,"There is opportunity for advancement if you put in the work, but there is a lack of job security. You are simply a number. Benefits are terrible, the health insurance is a high deductible one and there is no 401k matching."
good,This used to be a good place to work. Now they're overworking people with not enough compensation. Everyone is stressed and the environment is putting people on edge. The management keeps throwing new ways to make things harder.
good,"There are those of us that recall waking up extra early to be the first person on the team to arrive.  Working was fun and everyday brought new and exciting challenges to be met, that we were always compensated for.   The culture of the workplace was family oriented and one for all and all for one."
good,A decent place to work. Flexible for some workers but a high demand on most employees. People are busy and confined to their own cubicles
good,"A typical day consist of greeting everyone in the section.  I would start the computer and initiate my Microsoft Outlook.  I receive emails from different managers and VPs in the email box.  At this point, I would review the emails and respond with the appropriate action or make corrections.  At this point, it is time to update the numbers in order to send out the morning numbers to the supervisors and VPs of the company.  Once this process is complete, the reports and exceptions are completed.  Items sometimes are dropped into a database to be processed.  I would enter the database and retrieve the information and update the database and spreadsheet information. A very important of my date is to ensure the bank files are processed correctly."
good,"A typical day at my current job involves entering a specific work queue to solve customer queries or transfer to the relevant department where appropriate. A few queues are worked on each day, after I move on the the internal SharePoint to receive any important queries or input data to be views by others as well as keeping up to date with any changes to the numerous work processes via email. I have learnt about the financial sector works in regards to credit cards and interacting with my team is the most enjoyable part of my job. I am given to the chance to share knowledge and help others when necessary whilst sharing out a heavy workload. The hardest part of my job is trying to correspond with customers to solve a query efficiently as my team are a back office team it is often frustrating that we are denied any direct contact. Lastly management are helpful if any questions are raised and are extremely accommodating."
good,Responsible for the day-to-day support of Genesys and Avaya voice platforms in North America along with providing over all global voice strategy.
good,"A typical day will be overflowing with mail of merchants making their payments on equipments used in their businesses."
good,"Best part of the job is that you have the freedom to interact with your clients as you wish and they provide excellent support for you to work from home, however, the company is unstable in the last year the comp plan has changed 3 times and it looks as if it is going to change again.  The company is in transition I'm not sure however I am loyal enough to weather the storm it is in."
good,"I enjoyed working at First Data, however it was on a temporary rolling contract as I didn't feel comfortable working in. I worked as part of a great team and picked up a lot of customer service skills in my 1 year working here."
good,My local team is the best. I don't know how we ended up with upper management like this.
good,Please see resume data entry and updating data basis daily. updating credit cards and submit chargebacks
good,It was my first real job i enjoyed. minimum wage and i worked hard ot get promoted but never did
good,"Only if you like reptitive task sday in and day out,"
good,"Too many projects per person, not enough resources to complete projects.  Sales area makes promises to clients we are not able to perform and later have to jump through hoops to meet crazy deadlines"
good,"Worked as a contractor The culture was not very positive, appreciate or conducive to a positive attitude.  The leadership team was severely lacking in every way."
good,"My situation was different I was contracted then picked up as Desjtop Support Analyst.  Working with guys was challenging but once someone develops and opinion of you, there’s nothing to get out of it, all of them work together.  I was pushed out of the IT department due to differences.  I was mistreated and wasn’t given the opportunity to apply somewhere else within the IT department."
good,"Quite a challenging environment at times, mismatch in company and global goals resulting in poor delivery and engagement with internal clients."
good,"I really liked working for First Data when I first started. There's a lot of advancement opportunities. The training is very thorough. They don't just throw you on the phones and expect you to do it right, you spend 6 weeks in the classroom and then another 6 on the floor with a trainer. But I got burnt out after about a year and a half. If you really like talking on the phone it's not bad."
good,"Although First Data is a decent company, it changes hands too often and they constantly over promise and under deliver. They also over work their employees and expect too much of them considering their pay."
good,"- pakiet medyczny do wyboru różne pakiety"
good,working for first data has its perks but they do NOT outweigh the negatives such as long hours and poor management. they make it practically impossible to book any holiday and they do not take into consideration personal matters such as children being ill or unable to travel due to wether. they will make you make up 2 minutes from a toilet break but you dont get to go 5minutes early at a later date if you get caught on a call at the end of your shift.
good,"I have nothing to say.  I only contracted here for a few months then was part of a major lay-off that affected most contractors. "
good,"First Data provides deceint benefits and room for advancement.  However, they have a reputation for frequently laying off employees.  Can't recommend."
good,I enjoyed working with the teams I had and the flexible hours were a bonus.  Currently the senior leadership is attempting to change the path the company is taking which is creating a stressful atmosphere as everyone worries about whether or not they will have a job once done.  The people are great and working with teams all over the world was a great experience.
good,"Depending on what department you worked, you would either be swamped with work or constantly get sent home because there was no work, Lots of different nationalities working there."
good,The job was fast paced and that’s what I like about it I stayed busy and I enjoy call center jobs..We didn’t learn much in training but once were out of trading we learned everything we needed to make money...
good,The work load and compensation does not balance out. The company tends to be unorganized and makes it difficult for our clients to meet resolutions when facing difficult situations.
good,"At First Data, no day is typical. The nature of my role is to be a competent manager for the client to rely on. Many of the projects are dealing with very sensitive data subjects so there really is no room for error. I have learnt many valuable skills which I will take with me throughout my career. Time management and organisation is key for success. "
good,"Different departments that you can apply for, and hours that work around your life. They offer great vacation and personal days and quick to approve when you really need"
good,I was not an employee so I did not really know company culture. I will say that it was a fairly pleasant experience to work at first data in Omaha Nebraska.
good,Management is very un-reasonable regarding expectations. Hours are long. Never know when you will have to work late or on weekends. Priorities are constantly changing.
good,"Decent place to work with ability to move up.  Corporate restructuring was constantly occurring however, leading to poor morale and high turnover."
good,"Empresa boa, porém sem oportunidade de crescimento"
good,"I wouldn't recommend this company seeing the amount of turnover on a daily basis. The Atlanta offices have a revolving door for a reason.  Upper management is protective of their positions and indifferent to the realities of business. There is a reason their stock is underperforming and will be a long struggle to overcome their debt. Loyalty and decency are not the cultures here and there are better companies that do offer that, just not at First Data"
good,It just wasn't for me. There was no depth of human connections. I made a few friends while there but for the most part people were disconnected from one another and zoned out and bought into corporate bs politics. Best part for me was getting paid. It was hard to care about the products we were developing. Felt inefficient and outdated in terms of technology and processes.
good,"It's not a bad job, its just the company has a bad habit of paying the absolute minimum they can get away with. Including hiring people for more money then the current employees make."
good,"""Tel u what you want and when you want it, and we'll deliver,"" mentality killing the company. The VPs tend to over promise and then work on apologizing when the impossible isn't delivered."
good,"ok company, not many chances to progress, and work a lot for the money. A lot can be expected of you, management not that great either. HR department not fab. ok first full time job."
good,I come in log into my computer and systems and start taking calls from Merchants (Small Business owners) have questions about their statements or fees or they my need to update account info or Cancel their accounts
good,"Like my job, professionals are treated like children; management not willing to change its course of management style. too much micromanagement ; poor communication."
good,High pressure environment. High expectations. Very poor benefits. Hedge fund took bought company and saddled it with tremendous debt that has led to company's poor financial rating.
good,First Data has been very good to me over many years. Lots of financial pressure to perform which is not necessarily abnormal these days. The culture has shifted and whether to the better is up to the individual.
good,"I am on the road twice a week working with bank partners to create long term goals and drive revenue.  When in the office, I cater to my partners needs as it relates to marketing, retention, customer service, finance, and product support."
good,"Company is SLOW to respond to critical issues, hiring, reviews, advancement, raises, bonuses all take forever allowing competition to beat them at every turn."
good,Managers do not know how to treat their employees. Bad benefits and management do not appreciate employees. They only remember their errors
good,"worked on customer credit card issues. When a customer had an issue with a credit card charge,  we would do a temporary chargeback on the charge & forward to next department"
good,My review will be given upon request. I've been with the company prior to the transformation. I've had many different experiences with the organization and have seen many changes taken place.
good,it could be way better. i am ready to leave after two years. the facility is dirty but the building coordinator finds nothing better to do but walk around all day.
good,extremely high turnover of employees. First Data set very high quality requirements of the employees increasing the stress on the employees with no consideration to the amount of changes to job description on a daily forum.
good,Direct management wanted to see me grow and supported me. Executive team did not care for the work force in Colorado.  Made some very strong connections.
good,The original First Data when I initially arrived in 2005 would have received 4 stars in all areas. The company changed management in the latter part of 2005 and  the ratings are pertaining to the change.
good,"Wonderful culture when hired on, but changed drastically as moved on under new management, who wanted to drive more work and less life balance.  Benefits constantly cut and management culture changed to motivation by fear.  Wonderful co-workers."
good,"I had accepted this job in hopes that the management approach had changed, and soon found that it was the same job that I had 12 years prior.  Frequent micro-management in the bank alliance stifles enthusiasm for over achievement."
good,Punch in and punch out. All the managers were concerned with was high call volume and not quality of work. Didnt spend time with co-workers. Most enjoyable part was this was a stable job and guaranteed hrs. The hardest part was hostile clients and constantly being accused of being the IRS
good,I was only a temp employee so I don't have to much to say except the people were nice and friendly.  You get free coffee and that is all you get for free.  I'm looking for a full time job now.
good,"Fast paced, supportive local workers, instructive documentation needs to be re-written, contains errors. Required systems are very slow, and fail consistently.  Management feedback is always critical"
good,I've learned a great deal in my position with First Data from how people run there business and how they process. I also learned how the Card Associations work and what they require from merchants.
good,"great place to work co workers are friendly . management is easy to get on with , giving good customer services."
good,"Having worked as an IT Security administrator in the financial sector, with a help desk environment, my trouble shooting, customer services and understanding of timely feedback and close out of services tasks is well tuned."
good,Very laidback work environment. Advancement not acheivement based but what positions need to be filled.
good,The time i worked there was not enjoyable at all. Management was never available for help.
good,"I like my job very much it was busy work, but hours got cut back."
good,"Certain departments worked a lot harder than others and they received less pay. Supervisors would pull others from their departments to HELP in a different one, while their own department was getting backed up."
good,"The higher ups only care about the dollar. They don't care about the employees. This new insurance is proof of that. The CEOs come through, get their money, then stop the company like a bad habit. They are not understanding about your situations. You can almost die on your way to work and have to call out, and they'll still fire you. Their policies benefit the company only. They keep their doors open in places where the average wages are low so they won't have to pay much money, therefore benefiting the company."
good,"Was once great.  It is no longer a good company to work for.  There have been about 6 CEOs in the last 7 years.  All come and get large salaries, do nothing positive with the company and then leave with millions of dollars.  You can't run a company that way."
good,I am lookup clerk on graveyard shift I  perform a lookup process for correct account numbers for payments  process the job is fairly simple ok management ok coworkers hardest part of job is staying awake all night
good,Fast paced work environment. Work hours not very flexible. Small pay increases. Lots of mandatory meetings and overtime.
good,"Nice coworkers, great overtime and under time opportunities, bad work ethics, unfair working standards from high positions, good benefits, but no chances to expand in the company, and no pay raise opportunities either."
good,"The working hours are great. "
good,"I have none, they give you a training class and then you are given a two week certification period to go thru where you have to score a 100 percent with no errors on your calls for those two weeks"
good,"Training is short and not very insightful, feel like a number not a person working there. Parking is a nightmare having to get a bus to the site from car park."
good,Nice place to work.  They lay off frequently though.  Not long term opportunity..even if you do the job well.  I was laid off one mth before being there for a year.  I was saving accts left and right and still got laid off because my call productivity was not to their standard. So if you treat the client unprofessionally your productivity can increase.  Si
good,"Just like any other big company.  Hard to say...was taken over by Fiserv so I do not know what the culture there will be like."
good,Everything here seems backwards for a Company that thinks of itself on the tech edge.   Everything it outdated.  To many loop holes and no is serious about listen to what the problems are or how to fix them.
good,"Innerhalb des Teams und auch teamübergreifend ist die Kollegialität wundervoll!"
good,It was better company when I joined compared to when I left. I loved that company but management kept on changing and the policies implemented were not good. Overall good company to start your career.
good,"NTT Data Services has potential however aggressive sales of services and commitments made to clients are extremely challenging "
good,"Place is good to work, but I have seen many employees who are working for more than 7 years getting fired without giving alternate job in such a huge organization."
good,"Many responsibilities"
good,"I was supposed to meet with management once a month, that was largely over looked unless you were in trouble.  team meeting for leads was cancelled so often we forgot we were supposed to have them."
good,A typical day at work would be getting mail in of the mail truck sorting mail and sending to the 150 /51 to be processed. 150 machine would run the mail dumping trash from the 150 building boxes on daily basis and taking the non process items to be processed.
good,First Data is known for its frequent layoffs and whole teams are often replaced with contractors. There is very little culture and little room for growth. The hours are flexible but you are also expected to work at all hours of the night and weekends. There is little communication between teams and many roadblocks to implementing change. They are trying to change but large ships turn slowly.
good,Good company but focus (understandably) is on resolving debt and improving leverage above all else. Managment council is guided by stock price and allows it to drive short term decisions that could be detrimental long term. Culture is driven by earnings reports/stock price and company lacks the benefits and the warmth/balance to attract talent.
good,This is the new culture and saying at our site - First Data is trying to automate more processes but unfortunately there are more manual processes in which we have manage with less resources or time.
good,things are different when I was there but the pay could of been better. management was okay working there from 2006+then left in 2012 and the company was great.
good,"Due to lack of further career advancement opportunities, poor management communication and staff not being valued looking to leave but is a good first step in the work force a to get benifits, paid time off and they pay decent for the area."
good,"process credit card payments "
good,FDC focuses on the upper management and provides little advancement for people in lower positions.  Many times I was overlooked despite my dedication and loyalty to the company.
good,"Pretty decent management.  Good pay. Work a lot of weekends, nights and holidays on top of the Mon-Fri 8-5 schedule.  Good opportunity for advancement and learning."
good,"Great with flexibility, great with supporting minority groups and individuals.  Not a healthy environment.  The workload is super high due to lack of employees, but they decide to change methods instead of hiring new people."
good,"First Data’s 22,000 owner-associates are dedicated to helping local businesses and the world’s largest companies, conduct secure commerce more than 3,000 transactions per second, every day equalling $2.4 trillion per year.  Given the size of the organization, owner-associates have lots of opportunities in different geographies and every position in the payment system ecosystem."
good,"First Data advertises itself as a step up from ordinary call centers, but it's really not.  Things change all the time, management is not nearly as involved as they should be, and it only seems to be getting worse.  Honestly, your best bet is to see it for yourself.  In tears of internal growth, they excel.  Managers and other departments will always prioritize your growth and teach you how to interview and take on new responsibilities."
good,"If you are a contractor there they treat you ok, better then some worse then others.  While I was working there they put me on Sabbatical, because of the that, my regard for First Data went out the door.  They are a business who just wants to make money, and being a contractor there just means that you just work there and really you don't matter.  The other people I worked with there were a lot better, it is a typical story, People who you work with are great, the management well they don't know you exist."
good,"Enjoyed working as a conversion analyst at First Data in Omaha, NE and Tampa, FL.  Variety, challenging,sense of accomplishment.  Enjoyed collaborating with team member to reach goal and complete projects."
good,"Closing the office, lay offs"
good,"many peers are seeking new positions, little regard for personal situations and benefits are mostly paid for by employee contributions. The company has a problem with managing people effectively and providing a secure work environment."
good,Confused 1 year plan except to save money and cutting corners. No investment for the future and management continues to change. I do worry about their future to stay number 1 in the industry.
good,For 21 years I was quite pleased with the environment and the changes were mostly positive. When the company was bought by KKR the environment rapidly declined with multiple management changes
good,"FD paid well, but kept taking things away from employees, ie 401K and holiday/vacation. Somewhere along the way the importance of life and family balance was lost.  I had a great manager, but we were all under appreciated. Work load was too large to maintain on an ongoing basis."
good,"Management takes care of Director and above on a salary basis, but does not pay at the manager and below level.  Gives lip service to meritocracy but does not fund it to make it a reality.  Short sighted deals that rob from future revenue to make the current quarter numbers, which is unsustainable.  Systems are antiquated making the efficiency goals unrealistic."
good,"I liked my role at First Data and the work I was doing but the company itself is so out of touch with technology which was very frustrating considering it's supposed to be a technology company. The accounting systems are archaic and it was difficult to find anyone who cared about making things better. I think in general there is just a lack of accountability and motivation from employees and I think it's just from years and years of really low standards, the bar is set very low. If you're a person who cares about results and making things better, this is not the company for you. If you're fine with status quo and just coming to work everyday to do the same thing that's been done the same way for 15 years, this is the company for you."
good,I loved the opportunity to meet various business owners and help them achieve their Point of Sale and  payment processing needs.  I also liked the ability to set my own schedule. The job can be stressful but with a focused and positive attitude it is possible to meet sales goals.
good,The culture at First Data had changed greatly since the first time I worked for them.  They seem like they did not care for the employees like they once did.
good,"Change of management  caused stress an divisions within the company.  Overall, the place was a good place to work prior to the change.  Compensation and work life balance was good and opinions and suggests were listened to."
good,"I spent most of my career working with clients in ongoing years long relationships. If there was a problem the Company was there with the same concern that I had; Fix it.  "
good,"At First data i felt like the company had a high employee turnover and people get released from their jobs frequently. This job is very un-safe to try and keep as a career, although it is a good place to gain some experience from."
good,Hard to balance work life and personal life with extreme quotas to be met.  Some upper management was the best I ever came across and the worst I have ever come across.  Luck of the draw.
good,"Standard work day, knowing what needs to be done and getting it done. Management is like at any other Fortune 500 company. Hardest part of the job is trying to get expected workload done in 40 hours a week. Very satisfying work when able to get items completed."
good,First Data is a place an individual can work for a certain amount of time. It is not a career job as it has minimum salary. Good working Environment but below average salary and health benefits.
good,"First Data has some of the most talented staff at any technology firm. If you are willing to grow your technical foundation, this is the place to do it."
good,"Depending on your supervisor it can be stressful.  "
good,"A good place to get introduced into sales. High outbound call volume, constant pressure, and not much room for growth. All the managers are so focused on making numbers, that customer service is often overlooked."
good,"Been with the company for a year now and when I started off it was quite slick with the training class being very orderly and that side of the company was very nice and made you feel like a new family member. "
good,"Check attendance, listen to calls of agents for quality purposes. Attended several daily conference calls. "
good,The work was monotonous and mentally draining. I did not enjoy my time there. My co-workers were pleasant and easy to get along with. They made the day enjoyable.
good,It was an okay job. A typical day on the job involved standing in one place on eight hours loading an high speed industrial printer with paper and quality checking what came out.
good,"I learn how credit card machines work, and that they are need everyday,I just don't feel comfortable on the phones. I was in training for 8 weeks, testing is done every week . And you have to pass the test to work on the phones."
good,"Labor is divided down to very specific task, little middle management, usually report directly to a director, not even a lead position. Very fast paced & dynamic environment. Must be flexible and adaptable. Very demanding environment."
good,"Must be very careful of your peers.Place will have you going crazy if you all the people to get to you. The dress code is trash, not a very professional environment."
good,"Typically I would want to start my day with coffee and then check on my emails to begin working on them before my morning team meeting.  After that call, I would begin to schedule other meetings with co-workings all over the world in order to make sure they were in compliance with First Data policy's and procedures.  My co-workers were great and usually always available to meet.  I really enjoyed working for a large corporation and I was currently reporting to a direct manager in Europe so that was enjoyable.  To learn there culture while working on projects together."
good,"Company allowed me to learn and grow throughout various positions and departments over the years.  Tuition reimbursement allowed me to pursue a degree and enhance my leadership skills in and out of the workplace."
good,"Great way to learn business the what to do and what not to do in the work place. I learned time management while being with this company. The importance of processing work in a timely manner. Leadership needs more experience and needs to be more open with communicating changes within the company. As far as co workers, there is a lack of respect. Which also affects the way work is properly handled throughout the company. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing at the end of the day, I tried my best and did all i could do to help the company continue to be successful."
good,Talked to many interesting people via phone helped them with mostly billing issues.
good,"I would review many merchant accounts and determine the risk for the account, whether it was a credit or fraud risk.  From then I would determine what the actual risk for the company would be if we continued to keep the particular merchant on board.  Throughout the day the analysts would be on a hotline to field calls from merchant who had questions about their accounts.  My colleagues were very hardworking and motivated, we came in early and stayed late to ensure we exceeded our monthly department goals.  The hardest part of my job was the hoops I had to jump through to get funds approved back to the merchant.  We had to get approval from our immediate manager but then would have to obtain approval from senior management afterwards."
good,Very up and coming company. Training was very good. Corporate politics are very bad. Work environment is very hectic. Favoritism exists throughout the company.
good,In 2012 it was a good company to work for. Now under the new CEO and new management the place is falling apart.
good,"Balanced bank accounts on a daily basis, utilized various websites and worked closely with other departments to resolve issues."
good,If you are willing to work hard and relocate to another location outside of Memphis there is immense opportunity.  Memphis location lack room for advancement which is a huge development area.  Good company but need to bring more jobs to the Memphis area.
good,"Good place to work, fun people. interesting projects. variety of product to be trained in."
good,"The company is going thru major change at the moment which does not help with job security.  Growth opportunity could be there as long as the strategy itself continues to exist.  People there are wonderful.  Pay - is great for some, and terrible for others.  Coming in externally, ask for high salary or it'll be difficult to raise your base once you're in.  "
good,"Management was poor, Upper management strong. Stressfull working environment."
good,Gorwing company in internet payment gateway business.This is US based MNC.
good,"Good Place to work, just new management is changing daily.  Direction changes daily.  Good local people to work with though.  Hours are felxible.  Depending on what you do, salary might be ok as well."
good,"Not a bad place to work, but the unreasonableness of working in a large corporate environment and the self-defeating, contradictory policies start to wear thin, after a while."
good,"I was happy with the Business until the Insurance issues started. I enjoyed my job, the people I worked with, etc. The Insurance I was not happy with. They penalize you for having a spouce on your insurance that may be able to have insurance through their employer of $900.00 a year! Also, trying to advance your career is not as easy as portrayed. Unless you step on someone to get their, you might as well, count it out! Not impressed!"
good,"Was a good company to work for, during the length of time I was employeed there. The company decided to close the site that they had opened here in Louisville in 2009. And over 100 workers lost their job."
good,Good place to work depending on who your manager may be. A good place to gain experience. Opportunity for advancement is limited.
good,"It is very tedious work and boring. Management could care less about you as long as you make them look well. My co-workers were very childish and called me names. I ended up having to go to HR because my manager would not do anything, & still nothing changed. There are many job openings and ways to move up, however, I had a very hard time doing so. I decided to look outside of the company."
good,Being a team player is key for your success.  Get involved to learn the culture and the people.  Very diversed company which welcomes all walks of life.
good,"Your experience within this company is very dependant on the Manager you have, which can change rapidly, as a result popularity with the management matters. Your achievements and productivity are secondary considerations for promotion even with a demonstration of a willingness to push yourself. "
good,"Too much focus on average staff hourly rate, not enough on employees. Benefits and compensation were competitive for a long time but leveled off in recent years."
good,"FD was a very good company to work for many years ago.  They have a good foundation, but some departments do not follow through.  Management is not well trained and when you get moved around under different VP's it just gets worse."
good,It totally depend on the project to project but if you are really looking for payment industry experience ....its the most amazing place to work. Great experience
good,at times not inclusive  and mgmt support wasnt always available. Not the right place for me coming from a position where I was more of a contributor and less of a clerk
good,"Learned a lot about payment industries, debit card processing and check processing and also the security channels put on the credit cards, eg: verified by visa and mastercard secure code etc.  Good colleagues."
good,A lot of great benefits however not many opportunities for advancement. A lot of positions are either lateral movements or provide minuscule raises. The company was more focused on the product and services provided to merchants than the people assisting them.
good,Left along to execute responsibilities based on remit. Geographically dispersed company was difficult to navigate at times. Frequent changes in management contributed.
good,"First Data would have been a better company to work for if it had not had policy change, that negated your attendance. They have strict call handle time for department I was in, and for tech support for their website handling calls in 700 seconds. it should be dependent on the issue.  All calls are monitored and strictly enforced which added to stressful work flow."
good,First Data is a great place to start a career after college. It has many entry level positions and room for growth. There are many departments  you can move to and learn from.
good,"Took forever to get access to platforms and programs. Negative atmosphere from most."
good,"I worked as a data center engineer.  Great team.  Different then working with other teams and VP's.  Not the greatest benefits, pay was good. Great learning experience to transfer over to future opportunities."
good,"Much of First Data's core credit card processing system is antiquated and labor intensive to make client requested customization improvements.  Additionally, First Data struggles to be innovative and invests far to little in R&D.  With faster payments coming First Data's nightly batch processing and settlement procedures will be burdensome."
good,"First Data has a lot of great people working for the company.  However, managers have a lot of tasks so they do not have time to help their employees advance in their careers."
good,"It’s a good job, it’s easy I work in zip sort mid shift as a temporary worker  all I do is put mail into a tray *and some few other steps*and that’s basically it. The supervisors are really nice and helpful. But if your young or if you really like spending time with family don’t work here, It’s mandatory to work 7 days a week, I here some people talking about how they never get to do anything or see there families that much. I heard from an assistant supervisor that working 7 days a week is why people keep quitting. And if you’re a temp *we only work 5 days a week* they need help so bad you can literally just walk into work anyday and any time without asking. But other then that it’s a good job pays really well."
good,First Data is known for their layoffs and title changes. They do have the ability to provide their employees with training and advancement is very limited to only a few mainly the millenials. From my experience First Data prefers to promote from outside versus within. This is the trend and very common amongst most employers. I have witnessed candidates being hired into the same position internal candidates have applied for. There is no excuse or explanation why an employer would hire from outside versus hiring the many talented individuals they already have. Favoritism is very high there as well as other corporations.
good,"It's a very clicky place especially within operations, but if you want a good social life then it's a good place to work."
good,"Lots of moving parts here and managers are ""narrow focused"" to cover their responsibilities and are unable to guide a willing subject through the techniques and varied moving parts that could ultimately make ones job slightly easier and less stressful (i.e. sink or swim in an environment where the tools provided alone don't allow many to swim, and no leading by example, group meetings, or idea of how your hard work benefits the demands of a naturally stressful role where callers have good questions and you won't have good answers)."
good,Mid level management and below are the driving force behind First Data. Each day is task driven and I learned to multitask as a manager and own my part of the business. The hardest part of the job was the long hours and the most enjoyable part was the people.
good,great people but always fearing the layoffs.  It was great to work there however every year you have to see great people get laid off when they were making a great contribution to the company.
good,"Everyone gets fire from First Data, no matter if you are a manager or a new employee, it does not matter if you do a great job or not, if they want you out to benefit their pockets, you are out."
good,"This place is a great intermediate job to work for. Pay is low and training isn't top notch. It helped me to start off in this field, but probably wouldn't recommend it if you are experienced. I was ultimately laid off after 4 years of service and my work improved every year."
good,"Lots of changes "
good,"Satisfying to help customers with questions and inquiries.  Unpleasant handling angry customers but sometimes necessary."
good,"Very fast paced. Some decisions make no sense."
good,"The day would normally start with a morning staff meeting which could be canceled with almost no notice at times due to other commitments by the leader. Then, I might have a secondary staff mtg scheduled where specific areas to focus on would be discussed. After that,the workday really began in earnest. Deadlines that were clearly known were strictly adhered to and some managers would move them as necessary to accommodate newer items that were deemed more critical. "
good,Didn't work there long enough to be able to provide a comprehensive review on the company. I haven't been an employee at First Data in almost 3 years.
good,NO ONE'S job is EVER safe here. First Data does not have a good reputation anyway but ESPECIALLY in Omaha. The have to pay well to get people to keep coming in the door.
good,"The initial training and equipment provided allowed us to do our jobs very efficiently and quickly. Unfortunatey, the manager I worked under was newer than I was. His type of management style did not mix well with a number of people on the team. Now with the reorganization of the areas I am looking to move to a different position with a new company."
good,I had very good immediate managers which made the position acceptable for the time I was there. There were several times I tried to get better internal positions and they put a hiring freeze immediately after I applied for each internal position. I don't know if it was just general bad management or that they didn't want people leaving my eternally understaffed department.
good,I worked with customers processing federal tax payments and many customers were unhappy with the system. It was stressful and I was frustrated with that
good,"enjoyed coworkers, freedom to work on any current project."
good,"The only thing that kept me at this job was the pay, health insurance, and vacation hours. The management didn't care about us and people were being laid off left and right for no reason almost every other month. You never knew when it would be your time to go."
good,"Not being tied to a phone enabled me to be able to WFH on occasion.  That was the only benefit.  The talent wasn't paid what they were worth, so many left.  They are under staffed in many departments and there was no room for advancement.  I remember worrying every July and November if I would be laid off, as it was par for the course. "
good,"Worked with some good people. Was very hard work at times. Good "
good,"Some managers were good, some were bad.  First Data worked on the ""good buddy"" approach to advancement and not on how well you did your job.  No way to advance by being good at what you did"
good,"Many highly qualified and hard-working associates.  Unfortunately, the management committee doesn't know enough about the teams at remote locations (i.e. not New York), so they think everyone can be easily replaced."
good,"The hardest part of First Data is the attitude of some of the employee.   Also, upper management is not engaged in day to day operations.   Too many layoffs has to lead to knowledge going out of the door."
good,"The company had lots of turnover/. With that turnover was constant change in processes and procedures. The expectation was12 hour days of face to face, alliance meetings, conference calls and data updating."
good,"Worked at First Data for almost four years, advanced quickly, however when and if you have a problem with coworkers and complain, you will be cut from your job even if other people complained before you did.  As a Point of Sale Team Lead I had several agents over 3 years complain negative about how poorly another lead treated them, I tried to stand with the agents as I too thought this type of behavior SHOULD NOT be excepted in the work place, however I was left go and this NEGATIVE LEAD is still employed for 9 years and counting.  Keep in mind this place is a right to hire/fire employer, so why was this lead employed for so long knowing the negative impacts it cost our company.  Agents have quit, cried in bathroom, showed lack of quality, showed lack of care, because of this lead that First Data would rather employee.  Keep great leaders and you will continue to have great followers, keep in mind this company has a high turnover rate.  Wonder why"
good,"Opportunities to grow, not just within a department but within the whole company. Friendly co-workers, and intermingling with other departments. Safe and secure work environment."
good,"Working with this company, it is a good place to work, but the management does need work in my current department. I feel as if they do not know enough about my job to actually tell steer me in the right direction when I need assistance  with and escalated issue."
good,I have been working here for over 39 years and I loved my job and the family that I  have worked with . I am full team play and have been part of all the activity at the office and have learned alot be part of those projects .   Management in all the years that I have been here have been great and have taught me alot.   I thing the hardest day part of my job was training a new person to take over my position I am such a dedicated employee for all these years.
good,HORRIBLE place to work.  No work life balance.  No transparency from management.  Stressful work environment.  The company doesn't allow for process improvement ideas from staff.  All instructions come down from management without any input from staff
good,The work environment is not that positive making it very difficult to advance.  Even if you are a really successful employee. Senior management is out of touch with what really goes on behind the scenes.
good,First Data was an ok work experience.  The pay was good and the people were nice.  The actual job is repetitive and boring at times. The job also didn't allow you to have a life outside of its walls.
good,This Job as with any other came with it's challenges and there were many. I didn't like all of the favoritism that took place and some of the higher positioned people did their job but yet they kept the position
good,"For a long time it was a great place to work. Our team in Chicago was #1 in the country. Towards the end when I left they were micro managing all. I was at 756% of quota. They kept putting redundant hurtles in our path. Your day would start at 5am and end by 8pm."
good,"First Data appears to have a robust portfolio of products and services that ought to make them unbeatable, but they have failed to exploit that advantage effectively.  Many of their products are only adequate compared to the competition and are in need of enhancements and updates, but their product development is slow due to limitations of legacy systems.  A revolving door of leadership since the KKR acquisition has created a climate of instability.  Instead of making the necessary investments in their products, in their platforms and in internal reporting, they seem more interested in projecting an image of growth and profitability so they can go public."
good,The people I worked with our wonderful.  We went public and several changes have been made since this announcement that the owner associates didn't agree with.
good,"Need to look at new technologies - use of laptop to conduct conference calls, stay driven with training and new devices.  (headsets, laptops, desk extensions}"
good,"the company no longer exists. they went out of business about 5 years ago. CSR experience not needed. Was a great to work,"
good,"A typical day at work is very productive, there is always something to do...if not technical than administrative.  The environment is team cultivated.  The hardest part of the job is the fact there is no formal training and because the position is so demanding you have to really engage yourself in learning the processes quickly and efficiently. It is a very challenging position."
good,This place can only take you so far. Advancement is based purely upon friendships and politics. Not for those brought in at an entry level.
good,Great Co-workers and flexible schedule. Huge company however not many opportunities for advancement in the Canadian location.
good,"Poor culture. Unstable environment unless you are senior management or above. Everyone is expendable. I was laid off after 5+ years and my boss with 25+ years experience there was laid off too, as were many others with much greater tenure than me. It's not a place to feel comfortable. That is a fact. Any working there or who has worked there in Omaha will say the same thing if they are being honest. This is the job version of ""Buyer Beware"". You're welcome!"
good,"A typical day at work consist of reviewing more than forty bank policies and procedures and fulfilling customer service duties. With reviewing several bank policies, I have developed almost a natural comparative analytical skill. Furthermore, we have the National Bureau of Economics, the Department of Treasury, and the Federal Reserve. However,  I have recognized there isn't an authoritative governing bank regulating how all banks should proceed with policies and procedures. Banks are left to govern, merge, and cooperate with each other in order to strengthen their competitiveness and avoid the risk of losing to competitors. In almost every organization there are employees that free-ride from the hard work of their colleagues. At First Data, your colleagues will hold you accountable to your personal development within the company and make sure you are doing your share of work. The hardest part of the job, internally, is dealing with the fact that upward communication travels slower than downward communication. Externally, when call volume is high, switching from account to account and troubleshooting different issues can be challenging. the most enjoyable part of the job is finding solutions for people with different issues. At times, customers will ask for a normative perspective. At that point, I'm able to put myself in their shoes and reflect on what I would do if I were in their situations."
good,"Typical day would be very fast paced environment, rules and polices  change daily. Management changes a lot so  communication is something that needs to be improved on. Co workers are for the most part team players and willing to adjust to the everyday changes. The most enjoyable part of the job is setting out daily goal and then as a team completing that goal."
good,"Great co-workers and very flexible work and life balance. Big company that acts like a startup since the last few years have all been about the IPO. Many benefits cut, many jobs cut and many offices shut down. Three years of lost benefits, no matching 401k, and constant ""budget cuts"". Seemed completely impossible to move up with the company, especially in the last few years since they had to hire so many executives and of course support the IPO. After 18 years of dedication, I was laid off due to an office closure that helped support the IPO. Thanks for nothing First Data!"
good,"Getting things done here takes forever. Very segmented organization. Very top heavy organization, leaving very little worker bees to do the actual work."
good,Fun work place and a great place to grow and develop as a person. You bounce of other people within the job and the office started to get to crowded as the department grew.
good,"I believe that I am a target of workplace bullying. A typical day at work for me consists of a lot of background noise. The air is filled with it. There are certain co-workers who talk about me all the time; pick me apart all the time. For reasons that I do not want to go into I am extremely intolerant to being criticized over every little thing. This has gone on constantly for years and I feel that management has done a poor job of managing it. In fact I am convinced that there is one supervisor who went out of her way to bully me. There were also times when I was disciplined for those things that I did wrong relating to this issue but the people who were gossiping about me went unchecked. There's a lot of negative energy directed at me. And there's been unfairness. I once got chewed out in front of a lot of people (by the same supervisor I mentioned above) for a presumption I had made about what I thought someone said. I feel that was unfair because a lot of what people had been saying about me was based on presumptions. But they weren't called on it. Whenever the gavel of ""justice"" comes down it always comes down harder on me. "
good,first data is  third party card processor which had good benefits however is more concerned on how fast you can do the job instead of how accurate you do it.. I went for accuracy.my co workers were great.
good,"Nothing really enjoyable about the job.  Everything is dictated down and has to be followed to a t.  No room for one's own creativity.  The most difficult part of the job is that oftentimes assignments would be given done at the last minute when it could have been given much earlier.  Co-workers are of the keep information to myself school of thought.  The more knowledge you have and don't share it the more valuable you are and therefore your job is protected.  Well that's the logic at least."
good,"The employees of First Data are genuinely motivated and team oriented with mutual respect for co-workers.  Traditional silos within the organization are being eliminated to achieve greater leverage and maximization of resources.  However, there has been a significant change in the executive management committee with key positions being filled by former senior/executives from large banks such as Chase and Citibank.  The subsequent changes in management style and work-life balance have had a detrimental impact on the over-all culture of the organization.  It is apparent their is a monumental shift to business goals/sales regardless of impact to quality of work life."
good,"They've slowly been taking, taking, taking . Reduced the number of PTO hours, stopped matching 401k, health insurance costs increasing, etc."
good,The hardest part about First Data is that you will get stuck in your position. There is no opportunity for advancement only lateral moves.They are very behind on their technology
good,"No Comment"
good,"A typical day at work would involve me putting information into the computer, it was a very easy job and i am sad to say I didn't learn anything. Management were often firing and hiring people for the most smallest thing, they were not very helpful and you were often just a number to them which meant that there was no relationship between management and staff."
good,First Data is definitely going in the right direction with their new focus on customer service. They want employee focus on helping their customers grow their individual businesses thru payment technology.
good,"On any given day I would take a constant flow of calls from both merchant clients and independent sales office representatives needing help with credit card terminals. Both would either need assistance with troubleshooting a specific error or with programming/basic operation of the terminals. My 10-key improved greatly due to entering the merchant identification numbers and I improved as a mentor to new hires because I did it so often. Management was lacking in the fact that they don't enforce all rules/regulations. Co-workers in general acted as a big family. We all answered each others questions and helped out any other way we could. The hardest part of the job was when I had to leave a problem unresolved due to issues outside of my area of control, i.e. account changes or phone/internet issues. By far the best part was the gratitude from the merchants when we were able to get their businesses back up and running. It was also like getting to solve mysteries all day long, which made the job very fun."
good,"Role involved answering inbound calls, dealing with customer enquiries regarding their credit cards.  This included advising balances, interest rates, fees, investigating unknown transactions, taking payments, amending personal details."
good,Used ITT computer to key and delete returned equipment linked to merchant billing for numerous banks an alliances. The investigation part of my job I loved. Great co-workers and great team players.
good,"Over the past 24 years I have been fortunate to have been able to expand in a variety of career changes. First Data has provided that opportunity for me. I have worked with a number of wonderful, phenomenal, knowledgeable, all around good people, some whom have become very close friends. I love what I do, challenges and all. With the number of changes which have recently taken place within First Data, I feel it best to pursue something new."
good,"High paced enviroemnt, focus on Customer Care."
good,"•	A typical day at work, I would post a positive quote with the thought of the day. Morning meeting, the Manager would ask each person about their weekend then we will strategize and set goals, they want 100 out bound calls for sails."
good,"New IRS requirement which challenged the team to create, enhance, and perfect the process to comply with new requirement."
good,Responsible for growth and maintenance of revenue. Provide technical support to clients. Design an implement bank card plans.
good,"First Data is a company with a lot of smart people and good technology. However, the culture is being undermined by the private equity buyout prior to the recession that has left it horribly in debt. Everything is focused on cutting costs, that includes cutting people and centralizing resources. This makes getting anything done difficult because every employee is doing the work of three people and completely overwhelmed."
good,management was great in the early years as time went on and managers changed company slowly went down hill
good,I learned about about starting a business and whats all needed to be successful with it.
good,First Data was actually a good company to work for as far as their health benefits and the type of work being done. They were going through alot of changes though internally and considering it was during a downturn in the economy they didnt take care of the employees like they should have. Good people to work with though.
good,"The job itself was enjoying, but the management could use some help!"
good,While at First Data it was a great experience with the customers. However sometimes it was difficult to find supervisors when assistance was needed.
good,A typical day at First Data Call center was headsets on and go to work taking phone calls. I learned to be patient with small business owners. management- I did not see much of management unless I needed something from them. The hardest part of the job was to sit for 7 1/2 straight hours on the phone.
good,"Not employee friendly. When it came to employees, I felt it was not people friendly. I felt the people I worked with were quality. I enjoyed my time there. I felt that they could have taken care of their people better and have more room for advancement."
good,"You are asked to plan leaves minimum one month in advance or else they go as unapproved and your annual ratings and increments are impacted big time. Secondly the office location very far from thane station, so if you miss out on company transport its a big hassle to travel. You are asked to wait back after office hours many times but neither overtime or transport is provided."
good,Παρα πολυ καλη εμπειρια στεναχωριεμαι που εχασα την θεση εργασιας που ειχα και τον μηνιαιο μισθο που επισης ειχα  επεσα ομως στα πρωτα μνημονια 2010-2012 στις ανακεφαλαιοποιησεις τραπεζων και η εταιριεια ηθελε να μειωσει προσωπικο και εξοδα (δεν ειχε η εταιρεια και παραγωγη) παρα πολυ ενδιαφερων εμπειρια στην ζωη μου ...
good,I posted payment for different types of credit cards and other accounts.  Also did research accounts. Did data entry when they needed extra help. I opened mail and  sorted different types of  accounts.
good,"Nice culture,  people and working environment. Enjoyed working there - good benefits - not crazy about the hours, though - too many late nights - gets to you after a while - too many meetings and socializing during working hours - need to focus on getting the daily task done first, and not wait until the end of the day to commence work."
good,First data is a good company to gain relevant experience for many different jobs. With having many different departments to work in there is something for everyone trying to gain financial experience.
good,It is a decent company to work for. Work there get experience in your field then go somewhere else and make more money. The Fiserv merger has impacted the day to day operations.
good,I still have the same review since First Data is another account of Sitel which i handled. In First Data i handled their invoice and financial reports.
good,"Given the opportunity to manage your team using your own discretion, along with guidance form upper management. Able to attend numerous training courses to better educate yourself to better serve your agents and also gain experience in new aspects of the company. THe entire company is immersed in the company culture, many different events held for recognition of employees, to keep employees informed of new and exciting changes coming forth, equity provided within the company to employees."
good,"Nice work environment . Great team. I learned a lot from the manager/ director."
good,Working at First Data was atypical corporate culture with enormous bureaucracy and systems. There are competitiveness attitudes but open-concept/collaborative work space design. This is a sales driven organization.
good,"Difficult to maneuver cross vertical sales operating in a National sales capacity. Road blocks, red tape and common snags regarding commission credit when applicable. overall a good place to work, but individuals need to hunt and close to be successful. great job for the right candidate."
good,IVR department was a very slow process. Working with offshore programmers was not the ideal format for success. Work with my immediate supervisor was a joy but was handcuffed on what could be accomplished.
good,"First Data is a firm believer in saving money by eliminating positions.  Regularly throughout the year, they cut positions regardless of performance.  There is absolutely no job stability at this company."
good,Work enviroment wasn't the best but okay.Pay was okay at that time don't know about now. Benefits are good but could be better. Paid time off is okay too.
good,"Very difficult environment to make advances with products.  Too many different departments that don't work very smooth.  "
good,I loved interacting with my co-workers on the day to day basis. Sharing experiences with customers or just talking about our home lives. Being able to connect with people different backgrounds was often the highlight of my day.
good,"The company does hire from within usually, but there are lots of hiring freezes and always layoffs to cut costs. Company is very diverse and has employee resource groups for participation inclusion. The skills I learned here are difficult to transfer to another company because the job is so specific to the company. Senior management says to do more with less but many job functions fall on the floor due to too few people to cover the workload."
good,"Noisy, cramped, bullpen-like working conditions; inept management.  Flex time, within reason, management in a faraway city with little day-to-day involvement"
good,"good stepping stone to other opportunities, allows for internal movement, current company mantra is do more with less.  Very different cultures depending on the location."
good,the management are only concerned with themselves and their figures. They do not care about their employees and often treat you like rubbish if you do not always perform or get payments.
good,The benefits have decreased.  No 401K matching and the health insurance deductible is outrageous.  Seems executives think the only way they can make numbers is by getting rid of employees.
good,Worked with business to resolve data issues. Culture was good as people were easy to work with. Made job easier to deal with. Hardest part was there was no business leadership to support mission
good,Was an ok company when i started 7 years ago. The company is in debt and they are more concerned about the debit than their employees. They cross train you in multiple products and don't compensate you at all.Working for First data is absolutely not worth losing your sanity.
good,"The call center environment is extremely lacking, from coworkers bringing bed bugs into the office to managers that you never see but harass you on metrics to the worst schedule I've had in my adult life. I do not feel like this company cares about my well being or advancement."
good,Only issue I had here was that they were severely understaffed preventing me from being able to promote out of the department and ultimately leading me to quit. Other than that it was just your average tech support job.
good,a great place to work as far a benefits but they do not allow you to utilize your skills to the best of your abilities. They like to hire from within and depending on what department growth is there.
good,"A typical day at work sometimes involves a couple different meetings and work volume on a Monday is excessive. Management in some cases do micro manage and workplace culture is okay. The hardest part of job trying to reduce queue workload."
good,job security is always a concern. Lay offs occur several times a year with a guaranteed large layoff every March. Pay is above average and work schedules are very good.
good,"first data was good place to work, there were many opportunities to grow there. the benefits there were great as well. overall the management could be better."
good,While at FD I was afforded the opportunity to grown as a Business Consultant and take this success and experience and apply it to my Regional Sales Manager role.
good,I enjoyed my stay at First Data the salary could be better.  Very strict QA and metrics.  The benefits are good the work schedule is not so great.  Most positions you are required to work on the weekend.
good,"I was told some things during the hiring process that turned out to be false. I was misled about mileage reimbursement and a new comp plan revealed a cut in components I was expecting as part of the total package, for example activation and unit bonus' - I exceeded goal and went above and beyond but was not compensated for it. So I quit because I felt taken advantage of."
good,"It was fine had some good friends got on with mh job"
good,My typical work day was about 8 hours.  I learned a lot about the different products First Data offer to clients that utilized the First Data service.  I worked for some great managers that were very easy to speak with in regards to any topics.
good,"In implementation you get to work with a wide range of professionals from engineers to corporate presidents,CEO's and the production team. Every day present a new set of challenges that makes working in implementation an position that is always exciting and full of growth."
good,I was a contractor hoping to go perm.  Unfortunately there was a huge hiring freeze that took place while I was there so most contractors and a lot of employees were laid off or quit.
good,"Good benefits. Nice facilities and many avenues to explore. "
good,"Meh, underpaid and overworked.  Time off is irritating to schedule.  Management is meh. "
good,"First data was an interesting place to work.  It was very structured and it helped me to focus on what needed to be done.  However, if you needed to work with other departments that you weren't directly involved with it could be a real pain,  There was very little inter departmental cooperation, unless you worked next to the person."
good,"ok place to work......but would not recommend working there, the people were easy to work with....but a lot of times you ran into people that did not want to do their job...so you had to do it...and you were not paid for that......"
good,"First Data has grown and changed over the years. I have spent many years of my career at First Data and I'm sad to leave, but it is time to explore other opportunities outside the company. First Data is a great place to work and the company is continuing to grow."
good,Employed 21 years. New motto was do more with less. I was ok with that theory.  New supervisor not at my site. Hard to have 1on 1 time with management the last 6 months of employment.
good,"I learned a lot of things at First Data like how to be a lead, learned about different departments, credit cards, country codes and postal , working under pressure. The culture was very diverse and the most enjoyable thing about the job was how the employees were like family"
good,"On the cost center side of the business, they are cutting down expenses everywhere from benefits to salary, Despite an exceptional 3 years of performance, the company/ department did not recognize that as being worthy of being paid an industry average or 10% of the industry range. I would recommend it for people who are just starting out."
good,They do not value your work life balance. They bait and switch you on compensation. Very Cut Throat they pretend they care. Its very stressful and an unhealthy work environment.
good,First Data is a decent place to work.  Not sure what else to include within the review I am providing at this time.  I would not like to elaborate at this time.
good,"I enjoyed my job and I especially enjoyed the team of people I worked with."
good,"create own schedule"
good,"It is an okay place to work, staff are nice and the work is constant. You are never sitting there bored and always working. There are two buildings and I've only worked in one"
good,"There was a good working environment. I gained different mail processing experiences. I enjoyed my work. My management was very friendly and easy to communicate with. However, the amount of effort I had to put in was not worth the small reward. Also, sometimes I would need to work on holidays."
good,"was not at the company very long, however did work extremely long hours and had alot of my direct supervisors work dumped into my lap to do. employees where very hostile to change"
good,If you dont live in Atlanta forget about move forward with the company unless your boss resign... also the company is not organize they are not on the same page you may ask the same question to 5 different departments and you will obtain 5 different answers...
good,Upper Management does not care about employees. The company is alway looking to cut departments and likes to lay off people every two years. Alright if you just need a short-term job.
good,"Job was high volume/fast paced/deadline driven which i thrive on. I learned alot about the payments industry working at FD.  Management through my tenure has been good, especially my current manager.  Unfortunately, the culture of the workplace changed dramatically.  Less people doing more work. The reason why I would not recommend FD to a friend is because Melville site is closing. The hardest part of the job, has been limited resources.  A co-worker and myself were responsible for managing over 2000 forms. The most enjoyable part of my job has been the job itself."
good,Eight hours and no more.  I learned on the fly with little formal training.  Upper management did not appear to care about the needs or desires of the lower level workers.  The culture was very inclusive.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to win cases for our cardholders.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to provide customer satisfaction.
good,"Basic corporation "
good,"A typical day was usually easy going, since I worked there awhile it was second nature to me.  Sometimes the deadlines were pretty tight, made for hectic days.  I liked co-workers , the pay, and most of the benefits were good."
good,"Busy."
good,"They flood the market through multiple avenues. Selling against your own company at every turn. Then they give you no support. Lost 10-20 deals on circumstances where they never even replied to me. If you are a hunter and can learn quickly to become self sufficient, you will have a chance of being successful."
good,"Suitable for people who are inbetween jobs, or just need a job for the time being. Not really a career as such although you can progress through the company however its not a very exciting place. "
good,"I loved my job and the people I worked with were great.  If that was all there was to working with a company then it would have been perfect. But opportunity for advancement are not so good.  Turn over is RIDICULOUSLY HIGH, and the red tape and bureaucracy, the cliques and corporate hoops you have to jump through will choke the life out of you.  Try to avoid those and you may just succeed."
good,Great job for someone to move up in the company after a year. A lot of hard work and dedication is needed working with customer service for business owners. I Do feel that it's extremely easy for you to become a manager there and some people shouldn't hold that position due to lack of experience and business like behavior.
good,I have learned a lot about Project Management here. The people I work with are very nice and supportive. Upper management seems to not have any organization.
good,First Data was a great place to work when I first started but after a few months they kept changing so many things and the employees were not happy about it. We still got the work done the best we could.
good,"The job was not too hateful, I worked Night shift and didn't care for it also could not change my shift leading to my leaving."
good,"Great people, but there have been many changes in the past few years that have made for a sometimes challenging culture."
good,I dont recommend working here if you are looking to advance your career. job is stagnant and not well organized/well-ran.
good,Saint Joseph was definitely the field of work that I am interested in. I would simply grow more as an associate in a more hands on environment. I enjoyed speaking to the clients.
good,"Administrar as atividades de Recursos Humanos e atender as demandas que vêm da corporação."
good,Hard working cold calling in a remote position which can feel isolated learned a lot about the industry just like any big company expect politics extremely competitive industry earning the sale feels great because you make residuals
good,The salary doesn't match the work expected nor is it in line with the cost of living.  Salary needs to be raised for the lower tier employees.  Those working with and/or for the merchants.
good,"Great place to work with and I had good co-workers and colleagues to share happy and sad moments. Like a family, very good environment to cherish in a life time."
good,Overall i enjoyed my time at First Data. Although they didnt have anything to offer when it came to employees needing a space to relax. Everyone there was always complaining about the clients and not enjoying their jobs or the pay rate. Managers were great with helping us reach our goals.
good,A typical day is just going in there and getting my job done.  I learned that you can't really go far in the company not unless you have management skills.  So far all my managers been good to work for.  My co-workers are also good to work with.  There really isnt anything hard about my job.  The most enjoyable part of my job is I get to work independently and I always meet my production standards.
good,"Co-workers grumpy, most days...really didn't want to work, I guess "
good,"Review and analyze business requirements. Conduct data mapping. Lead conversions tasks.  Monitor project progress. Provide issue resolution for client. Management is number driven, sometimes missing the people factor, however co-workers make it a healthy and fun environment. The most enjoyable part is to see the end result of a solution I've designed."
good,A typical day at work is taking phone calls from frustrated merchants dealing with cardholder disputes. I do my best to educate them on how to protect themselves against chargebacks and to win their cases.  I have learned how to be extremely patient with people because I understand thier frustration. I have a wonderful manager and my co-workers are fantastic. The hardest part of the job is sitting all day. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of the job is that I learn something new everyday.
good,"A typical work day was reconciling and reporting the sales of gift cards upper management."
good,I personally did not like the job or the company. They approve short term disability and then did not pay me.
good,competitive sales environment with a variety of compensation plans that changed semi-annually.
good,First Data is a good company to work for. The atmosphere and people are great. I learned a lot from working there and it helped me grow my career. The hours can be long with no overtime but if you work hard enough you will be compensated.
good,"Large company, that used to provide exceptional benefits but has since become too large with antiquated internal systems."
good,"Always Changing and a good place to learn many systems."
good,Great group to work with.  The constant was change to continually improve the processes
good,"Employees are empowered to meet customer needs, and encouraged to grow relationships with the largest clients.  Co-workers are dedicated, hard working, and committed to representing First Data in a positive light."
good,Comfortable and knowledable atmosphere. Co-workers are pleasant and work as a team
good,"A traditional American company that has the vibe of old steel, big blue IBM life. The company expects professionalism in all interactions, and works with very large clients in the merchant services and card processing spheres. A job in the NOC is hot/cold depending on how the infrastructure is performing that day, some days you will be supporting multiple incidents, other days you may not have but 4 through your entire 12 hour shift. Conversation between operators passes the time, no browsing or personal internet time really allowed on the floor, nor is cellphones due to the security risks of cameraphones to some of the data present. The schedule is good for work life balance, I often found myself bored on the last day of a 4 day off window. as the shifts are 12 hours 3 on, 4 off, 4 on, 3 off swaps."
good,"A company revolving around change and expansion. Very good benefits starting off, alot of corporate changes coming into effect."
good,"outbound calling, queue lines, salesforce, outlook, excel, selling skills."
good,"With this company, employees are not the first concern.  Turnover and layoffs are constantly hanging over your head.  Sad but true."
good,Helped me gain advanced computer skills.  Poor job security. Loved my coworkers
good,"First Data was a good place to work, just wish I had more time to grow within the company. Close site location"
good,"First Data is a good company to work. I learned about credit card terminals, and how transactions are run in the background, and very diverse workplace."
good,An overall ok place to work compenstation at base pay is not nearly enough for the job you have to do
good,"Monitor accts for fraud activity, close credit card accts, learned how to look for fraud activity"
good,Iba a la oficina y preparaba mi ruta en la zona.
good,"• As a designer on the marketing/creative team, typical 9-5 day was like most other corporate job experiences I had."
good,A typical day at work can go quickly as you are on the phone to customers a lot. You have to have the ability to communicate properly and have the right sort of tone to speak to customers as you are essentially asking for their money. Management is that great and there is no loyalty to members of staff who have been there a considerable amount of time.
good,Good company to work for. The worst part is sometimes management doesn’t take into consideration what all we do. Sometimes the compensation is what it should be for the roll.
good,"The job itself as a helpdesk Agent is stressful. There is rarely a break between calls and you are frequently abused by the callers. The management appears to care about you until you do not hit company targets and you will be fired. NO JOB SECURITY. "
good,Great Company to work for there is room for growth and an all around great culture.  I learned a great deal of information working for this company about the banking and data world.
good,"Working at First Data was enjoyable, although a little mundane and repetitive at times. What made the job fun and productive was the other employees being able to socialize and to help each other when we could. There was always a great vibe around the office and it was easy to get along with everyone or to ask for help."
good,"FirstData was a good introduction to the working world especially as i was dealing with all different kinds of people, however there was not much room for progression in my opinion"
good,"Good Company, however slow career progression and training. Repetitive and unchallenging role suitable for a school leaver. The hardest part of the job would be maintaining motivation."
good,The workplace environment was stressful for me. This was only because they need more staff on the floor to take the calls within customer service. I managed the calls well considering but there were multiple occasions where I had to stay after work to complete these calls due to me finishing at 9 and there still being people in the que waiting. This was not considered overtime either and the hours were not made up during lunch breaks even tho being promised.
good,Job was a great experience. I would suggest anyone to work in the company. No bad reviews about the company. Management is not bad and the employees are amazing.
good,"Typical day at work you're there exactly 8 hours with a 30 min paid lunch. "
good,"good place to work and good to gain experience in a financial company. sufficent parking available if you drive to work."
good,Al integrarse la ex procesadora de Argencard a la estructura de First Data se modificó para peor la cultura de gestión.
good,The environment here is one where things are constantly changing and you are constantly learning new things.  It is exciting and engaging for the employees.  The workplace culture in general is very community based and welcoming.
good,"They thoroughly prepare you for taking calls (training is like, 2 months) -- pretty easy to get a grasp on what to do but if you're not good at dealing with people you don't want this job."
good,"Like most public corporations, First Data fell into pleasing stock holders over taking care of their employees. They let go of a lot of great people in an effort to reduce expenses and I believe the company suffered as a result."
good,"Overall, the company has a goal focused culture, keeping track of every detail pertaining the management of personnel and the need of these to be able to deliver the desired outcome, at the minimum cost, in the shortest time possible."
good,Spend about seven and half hours on the phone answering the phones.  Deal with an array of issues that you may or may not be able to resolve during the call.
good,Great paying job and great benefits just workload is high and quality is high and every quality agent grades your calls different ly makes it hard to get a perfect score or improve
good,First Data was a pretty good company to work for. The benefits and pay were decent. The work environment itself was a bit monotonous but overall a decent job.
good,"The rules go by what department you are in.  If you are in call center, they have a different set up than other departments.  I worked there over 30 years.  I never really was able to advance."
good,"Εξελισσόμενη επιχείρηση με δυνατότητες εξέλιξης σε θέματα τηλεφωνικής εξυπηρέτησης, όχι όμως σε θέματα backoffice"
good,"The company has it goals in mind, however don't give employees enough time to achieve them.  Not open to new ideas and salar . not enough time to learn your group  about your merchants to achieve its needs, cold calling, to each assigned merchant group,"
good,The company closed down back in 2000s not sure what year. But depending on seniority you got to pick your hours first and what shift you wanted to work.
good,Boring work but not that bad in the grand scheme of things. I have had worse jobs and it was my first real job so hard to compare it to anything at the time
good,"In the payments industry, this is one of the best places to start. competitors recruit from here all the time. The company is dominant in the space and is a good mark on your resume for the industry. you will work long hours and missing quota can get you a termination letter quickly."
good,"We have to work weekends schedule, sometimes we have to work 7 days/ week. I learned a lot of lessons when I work with my supervisors and management over there."
good,"no review right now, it ok to work there. Good life and work balance."
good,This was an okay place to work.  You were set on a strict schedule and were not treated like an adult.  Bathroom breaks were scheduled.  Lunch was scheduled on a shift.  It was in Corpus so the culture was weird.  They shut it down after I left. Sad that all those people lost their jobs.
good,Go back to what this company use to be. I use to love coming to work and considered this to be a career but now it's just a job I am ready to leave. The whole moral of the company have went down drastically!
good,Their technology is old. It takes forever to do anything. It's impossible to do new things because they are almost bureaucratic. It used to be better though.
good,"Management doesn't seem to be what they are doing. They lay off people with experiences all the time. We get so understaffed, then they hire new people."
good,This was a decent company to work for as they offered adequate training in order to meet expected quotas and were available to assist employees whenever possible.
good,"good job, however you have to put in the effort. The reward for amount of effort put is very good. With time becomes easier, and more fluid. Initially hard"
good,"As a scrum master role I feel the work place is good and team is good and I loved to my job role and perform all the duties which I supposed to deliver. "
good,"FirstData was a OK company to work for besides when they demanded you to work overtime and just about every week it is required while the extra pay is nice, I like to have more home time. Enjoyable part was I made some cool friends."
good,I wish that when FD closes a department they would allow to transfer to another department and continue on growing by setting roots and broadening/developing a better career.
good,"•	Handle incoming Merchant service calls for Bank of America in a call center. "
good,I enjoyed my time at first data. My supervisor was a nice guy. My employees made the work enjoyable. I did not like the shifts available in my department.
good,"First Data is a Highly Secure Call Center with various departments within the Company. Employees assist both customers & merchants on the phone. There is an opportunity to Cross-Train for other departments, and many employees take various types of phone calls throughout the day."
good,"It didn't feel like the people on top, CEO's and manager's etcetera, really cared about those on the bottom of the totem pole. Most of the time I worked there, there was some kind of hiring freeze or wage freeze. We never got bonuses and rarely got raises. The management was not transparent about things going on within the company. The stress of getting laid off was constant."
good,"As with any place, most depends upon what you make of your own attitude toward situations and circumstances.  There will be adversity, challenge and things that don't go the way you wish or believe they should, but your attitude determines your altitude not your circumstances.  There is a very good support system from middle and executive management but it requires effort, persistence and patience."
good,Doesn't check frequently the employees deployed on other sites. No problem in terms of over time pay and payday never comes late. No assurance whether there will be tenureship  on the said role.
good,"First Data provides a professional environment for work. It provides opportunity for education and training. However, career development opportunity is limited and restricted."
good,"Great people to work with hard workers. clean envirorment, nice equipment, fun to be around at times, open to ideas from the people that do the work. Nice breakrooms."
good,"Depending upon area within organization, determined your career satisfaction. Some areas are very heavy with favoritism and they do not value their team members."
good,Worked for FD India for a Period of 4 Years. Was reporting to an excellent manager in the US. Was literally an orphan in the office as was not called or involved for any office related activities
good,"I was not there for very long. I enjoyed working with the staff. "
good,its ok. work life balance is important.  schedule is typical 9-6 with options to wok from home in most positions. workplace culture is typical of corporate environment.
good,"cube work, computer work, nice people to work with who are willing to assist you with questions.  Cafe onsite makes lunches easy.  Quiet working space."
good,"First Data cared about the company and would have town hall meetings, and fairs to allow employees to see the different committees within Firstdata.  The company encouraged everyone to participate and to have their voice heard."
good,"Long, boring, repetitive hours, stressful call-center environment. Always fought with other departments, had to fix other's mistakes constantly. Policies are a little bit too strict."
good,It's a good stating point for getting your feet wet in the job market. Cross training should be mandatory and the company should promote from within. I would recommend yearly pay raises and a competitive starting salary.
good,It has been too many years for me to give much of a summary.  It was a job to get me from A to B.  Some enjoyed their job.  I didn't care for it much and was glad to move on.  It just didn't suit me and my personality.
good,"Difficult to implement system projects across all business entities. "
good,None at this time. If this is required by Indeed then I will pass on using your site. Please let me know why you require this information ? You have my contact info to reach me.
good,"Great place to work, great benefits. good team camaraderie. great opportunity for growth. advancement, continuing education employee involvement. great leaders"
good,can be stressful very fast paced pay is decent but should pay more for all of the roles they want you to partake.                                  ska
good,"They didn't seem to care as much for their employees, especially when they removed the 401K contribution matching. I thought that was a poor decision to make for it's people."
good,"typical work day"
good,"·	Answered incoming calls, provided support, troubleshooting and training to merchants"
good,"I had a very understanding boss, who truly believes in a work - life balance.  Other areas of the company had supervisors who may not have seen work life balance as a priority"
good,"Processed prepaid network card transactions. Dealt with customer issues about account balances, check reimbursement, bank deposits. Daily balancing of deposits being distributed amount corporate clients that provided prepaid cards to their employees."
good,First Data was very stressful because management had terrible communication skills. Information is not communicated but are punish when tasks are not executed.
good,"Professional culture"
good,"First Data requires a strong work ethic, centered around discipline of duty and time management.  There is a sense of purpose in all roles provided.  The company requires the utmost dedication from it's employees with an strong industrious mindset. Opportunities for exposure to new technology is largely available.  Internal certification training is also an option."
good,"First Data Corporation is a large company that processes financial transactions including credit card, ACH, etc. However, like most large companies, upper management makes decisions that cause layoffs and relocations."
good,Good company that appreciates its employees. Good corporate structure and management. The work space was very good and accommodating. Friendly colleagues
good,"The company is not bracing new technology and not well organized, work flow is not controlled very well, have many issues that hard to resolve and time consuming."
good,The company use to be much appreciated and much more fun to work. I worked with this company for 13 years and a lot of friends and colleagues. We all work
good,This is not the company for me.  I did not like the management after the new ceo came on board.  The was not in the type of character I was expectings.
good,"First Data paid well and offered a variety of good benefits.  In return, long hours were required and, at times, hostile working conditions. I have not worked for First Data for since 2012"
good,First Full time job. The people was nice. Need a better time of system though. I don't like how you can only take off a whole wee at a time and not just a couple of day.
good,"Daily grind included working on tickets, answering emails, reaching out to clients, resolving their issues, researching product issue to find a solution."
good,"It was a great atmosphere, amazing staff and the benefits were amazing by far. I left because i was offered a better position with a different company."
good,"Strong, supportive management, decent work balance, good workplace benefits, investment in training and advancing the workforce, treats all members of staff - including seasonal temps - with dignity and respect."
good,"* Response on email"
good,"This is my first job where I felt I was continuously being developed and pushed to my limits. This position has taught me a wealth of information and techniques that I will be able to apply throughout my career. My manager always pushed me far more than I imaged, she knew my career goal is to become a project manager and tailored my projects and tasks to allow me to gain as much project management experience as possible which is extremely rare to come across."
good,"Huge turnover, promotes false expectations for customer, trains salespeople well, doesn't pay well, quick to fire and hire if you are not making numbers from the start"
good,"First data, had great benfits and vaction time. Training was intese and long but well needed with the job I did. Team building was fun and management was helpful."
good,"If you're looking for a relatively lax and easy job that will pay you more than minimum wage, it's a place to start. If you're going to school currently, it's pretty decent money. If you're looking for career advancement or expecting much of a raise, then you shouldn't plan on being here for more than a year or two. Managers were super cool and the metrics you have to meet aren't strict. You can do wel and build repor. But ""well"" won't get you much further in. Start here, but try not to stay here."
good,it's flexible but they don't care much about their employees future or anything like that. They have moved me 4 times whit in the company but no raise or anything like that.
good,"The company is clearing out of the Englewood, CO location. Therefore, it would not be advisable to recommend anyone to work for this company in Colorado."
good,"Constant change at the top trickles down. Annual reorganizations lead to instability. It is hard to complete anything when the 'direction' shifts on such a constant basis. "
good,"collecting debt on a daily basis, working for multi bank collecting debt, reaching targets, helping customers in financial difficulties  giving customers advice"
good,"Request are not being handled in a timely manner i.e benefits, reimbursement. They are very strict on your work schedule, and they also require you to work on weekends."
good,cool people and cool place to work.  really enjoyed my time there.  wouldn't mind working there if I need employment.  be aware of all the time off that is offered.
good,"I have worked with First Data in many areas over the years, and have always been tasked with challenges that ultimately helped my career growth. I would say this it's a very demanding company, however if you have the drive and passion, you will love working there."
good,"The hardest part of the job would be the partner programs where goals aren't aligned month to month, making it harder to find constant success month to month."
good,Fast paced and high stress.. phone call after phone call and very stressful environment.  I did learn a ton at this position but it was extremely stressful and it was getting to be where they only cared about numbers and not taking care of the clients properly.
good,My only complaint would be that they are to diversified in their sales.  Meaning that a customer may see 4 different reps from different companies selling the same product as me at different price points within a week.
good,The users at First Data made the Stress of the job bearable. The end users were very understanding and patient it made working there an pleasant experience. It was never a dull moment.
good,"Huge changes made daily,very little thought goes into any of it. Act first, regret later. No job safety. Hired today, let go in two months..OR...offered peanuts to take a phone job. Alot of favoritism. i shouldn't complain because I am a favorite, but it does exist."
good,Operations in a security operations center offer a good entry-mid level experience in corporate security. Scheduling remains an issue. Vertical movement is discussed but not frequently followed upon.
good,very good company it was a good place to work not very good employees to work around they need more training class for the accounts they are receiving.
good,"Very good place to work. Friendly environment, great staff, benefits, and growth. Would definitely recommend this business. Military and family friendly and always willing to help."
good,The work I did for First Data was pretty simple.  It was purely data entry so the work was repetitive.  They offered the usual benefits that a big company normally would.
good,Great company and wonderful opportunity.  They are restructuring and moving locations.  It is good experience in an exciting industry.  I'm glad for my time even though it was temporary this time.
good,"The PTO and flex time are great, but in the time I worked there, I don't recall one person, actually liking their job there.  It's very unorganized.  Upper Management either A - doesn't communicate with Supervisors, or B - the rules change so often, no one can keep up."
good,My overall experience was good at the company. I enjoyed making my own schedule.  One of the downfalls for working for this company is that you have a lot of changes in leaderships. Its very hard to grow due to that fact your manager never see's how good you are doing.
good,"It was a good company to work for, many changes and a fast pace environment.  But the site closed, the company did offer jobs in another state which is a good thing."
good,Convergys is also a good company. There are also training that agents under go to be able to enhance their communication and leadership skills that are paid.
good,Didn't worked there for long so couldn't say much. But looks to be more of a startup and company is running on ideas of few. Work is ok and so is growth. Salary is a little better than its peers.
good,You never have to worry about not getting all of your hours and the schedules are pretty flexible. You have a great window to advance and it can be done quickly.
good,Customer oriented business.  Fast paced under strict deadlines.  Open door policy with management.  Culture was very corporate with strict policies and procedures.
good,"I don't remember much about this job it was a long time ago. I believe it was a telemarketing job, that all I remember. it was a job that helped me out when I needed a income."
good,I never had any real issues while I was working there. Their benefits were nice. They had paid vacation and sick time as separate pools of hours to take off.
good,This is a pretty good work environment. However they pay everyone different amounts to do the same work. They also do a lot of random layoffs. So not good to make a career out of this job.
good,"My worked ranged from airline reservationist when I was 18 years old and then multiple areas of jobs from long distance operator, Y2K Analyst, Statement payment analyst, and command center analyst as well as file/data transmission analyst."
good,"Only worked there for a few months. But was an easy going environment, everyone was super nice. Was a good at your own pace. You have your own cubical."
good,"I have no comment at this time, other than working with my teams would be the highlight of my time working there.  Despite the culture, the people were supportive."
good,Company is great if you can get in above the ground level.  New CEO had halted a lot of the old advancement opportunities with new policies and downsizing
good,"There is alot of favoritism and way too much gossip, The pay was decent but they will fires you at any given time with no notice at all. The trainers are terrible and they don't sufficiently teach incoming employers what to do. The 2 weeks of training that i went to before I quit was ridiculous, and every single person from my training group got laid off a month or two after they got hired. I would never recommend this place to any of my friends unless they were desperate for money."
good,it was a relaxed and laid back position. I had to be on the phone helping merchants approve card issues. The merchants were really nice and was very helpful which made my job easy.
good,"The payments industry has a lot of innovation occurring and First Data touches all parts of the industry.  You can find a place to learn and grow if you take initiative.  You will find people who hate and love the culture.  It's a matter of what you do, where you are, and what your personality it like."
good,"First Data is all about the profits, if you are not adding to the bottom line then they will find someone else who can.  Didn't like the feeling of always looking for the axe to drop"
good,"A typical work day was fun, varied, and had many opportunities to share and collaborate. There were lots of moving parts and always more work than the time to complete it.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to say no to accepting any more work in a given time period.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing more projects being completed than you could imagine ever being able to do."
good,t had it's ups and downs as any work place would but the people are great and if you shine bright management will notice and put you in a position of leadership.
good,Smooth on-boarding process as well as training. Friendly and helpful environment. Must have great multi-tasking ability and pay close attention to detail.
good,"Global presence giving exposure working with multiple geographies"
good,On feet most of shift quick paced repetitive job. I learned that being on third shift is very difficult.  Management was concerned with getting the job done correctly with high level of accuracy.
good,Was a fairly standard job the only problem was all the forgien emploies would slack off and never get in trouble for it and i had to pick up there slack
good,Ericsson was a pretty good place to work. They supported multiple Telecoms and you couldn't be hired except from the home office. They were dealing with much staff the was over in India and as soon as they were trained they quit.
good,"I have been with First Data for a total of over 20+ years."
good,Working in the Command Center was challenging but could be rewarding.  We were the front-line when there would be system failures or problems with code.
good,"clean quiet office nice staff relaxed environment"
good,"You want your customers to have the best experience, and that means giving them options at the point of sale. Take advantage of leading technology in  systems to make it fast and easy for customers to checkout and connect with your business in and away from the store."
good,"First Data was a company that disclosed shortly after I began there a lot of operation changes including the closing and condensing of many office locations resulting in thousands of lay offs."
good,First Data was a fun place to work because I was constantly receiving incoming calls and assisting with training employees on how to conduct incoming calls.
good,Culture is driven by the department that you are a part of. The best part of the company is the people you get to work with and learn from. Many ERGs.
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company, l received training often and the CEO at the time always kept employee informed on the progress of the business"
good,Good income opportunity based on a competitive commission compensation plan. Overall management is good. Most difficult part of the job is the inability to provide a positive end result to customer service issues. Back end support is not held accountable for timely results.
good,It all depends on how comfortable you are in doing business to business everywhere. Have to open accounts and keep good numbers in order to make money since it is a commission based job.
good,If you like constant challenges this is the place to work. Working here will help in developing problem solving skills. The hardest part of the job is some of the processes are complicated causing delays in improvement of processes and getting access to necessary systems.
good,"Nice place to work managers are very helpful, they give good insight on the job, good pay and benefits, you have a good opportunity to move up in the company"
good,"A challenge to meet performance standards, when they have no was of measuring daily work. "
good,"First Data has recently went IPO and is experiencing growing pains while it adjusts to a rapidly changing industry. There is plenty of legacy employees that retain a lot of knowledge, but sometimes work in silos making it difficult to access that knowledge to help new employees learn and grow."
good,"Each department has a different function. You can be in customer services, terminal help desk, IT help desk, Network Dept. You have your standard managers and directors. It's an average corporation."
good,The best thing about this job was its employees. The salary for the jobs is not on the avg in the country. A Typical day here is to always be ready to be on the phones all day.
good,"Was a pleasure to go to work great team spirit and excellent facilities."
good,"There is a lack of training overall"
good,"Enormous global company...a good company...very top heavy"
good,"This position gave me great cold call experience. I managed collections portfolio for individual and commercial accounts, liaison between creditor and debtor, assisted with settlement negotiations and closed with an 80% collection rate at my time at First Data."
good,Great associates but needs better advancement and growth within i enjoy the individuals makes rhe job loving and workful but i am looking for growth........
good,"With the transformation of the company, things changed daily and no set routine was established. I enjoyed the my co-workers and the fast pace environment. The management team was hands off and let the staff work as a team in collaborating solutions to problems."
good,"It a okay place to work . Not enough structure, and there isn't room to grow, unless if you know the right people. Wish there was a structure on how  to advance and more information on how to be better at your job."
good,"The pay rate is not competed to other companies. The weekly working hours of associated is fluctuated and going down to  day by day. There is not an opportunity to grow up career path in learning new things , jobs cross-training, to higher position and professional careers."
good,very laid back work but it simply was not a job for myself. I am well oriented with budgeting a business but I like to work with my hands and being active. I also like to be challenged with the work that I do for the advancement of knowledge
good,"Acquire a challenging position in an environment where I can best use my skills and education.  I’m looking for a job that provides experience, a deep sense of responsibility and allows me to expand my knowledge."
good,I choose to decline to review this company and will only discuss any questions about my employment with First Data at the time of a personal interview with potential employer.
good,Challenging and dynamic environment. Exceptional group of peers to work with everyday. Management changeover has been a concern.
good,Turn around in the building is high.  Stressful job requires a lot of inbound calls to handle. Management in some departments could use some training in that department
good,"I have worked at FD for 7 years and while I enjoy the job there is little emphasis on career progression. I work in a highly skilled managment position within IT and I have never received any training."
good,"I was let go due to the point system where I was penalized for being sick eventhough they paid me and being late by one minute a couple of times, but was told I was an excellent employee and if it were not for the point system I would still be employed."
good,No comments as it varies from project to project. work environment was better in new york compared to dallas. I have no more comments
good,"Συνεχης εκπαιδευση και αξιολογηση,πολλες γνωσεις παρεχονται σχετικα με τα χρηματοοικονομικα και νιωθεις ευχαριστηση εξυπηρετωντας τον κοσμο"
good,"learned a lot of different areas of the business, from phone calls to running machines, learning to run a print machine."
good,i enjoy what i do and the people that i work with. the HR department is a challenging and dynamic department. My manager is fantastic and so is my team.
good,Innovative but does not want to invest in its products and people. Post IPO growth is slow but the people closest to the clients are focused on success.
good,First Data is a call center where we handled in coming calls. There is room for advancement. Loved going to work and working with Mgmt and coworkers.
good,"Good company to work for.  They do need to create more opportunities for external candidates in New York/New Jersey area."
good,"Working with First Data has been challenging. A day involves catering to critical prod tickets and numerous production adhoc requests. In addition, participating in requirement spec and design review discussions."
good,"I operated the company for the owner.  I did daily schedules, payroll, bookkeeping, accounting, I was in charge of all hiring and firing of employees."
good,Up and coming company with growth potential for the business and employees.  Excellent global opportunities and compensation. Friendly environment.
good,"Elaboración y analisis de informes de varias empresas, consolidación de balances en diferentes normas contables, trabajando en equipo, cumpliendo los plazos establecidos."
good,There is a lot more to payment processing than can be trained on in two weeks. It would be easy to make a mistake and hurt a business owners chances of profitability.
good,"I have worked for First Data for 7 years and I have learned a lot from management and peers. Company has evolved and continues to evolve. I moved into my new Compliance role two years ago and I have to say that my new team is an example of professionalism, dedication and hard work.Enjoy working in the Security department. Great management. Great working relationships."
good,"•	Assisted customers with inquiries, complaints, billing, payment, extension requests and data entry "
good,"First Data has a diverse culture, global.  Required to make a 97% compliance for time on phones. Learn about banking and assist business owners"
good,"First Data is a fast paced yet friendly work environment. Employees are encouraged to be responsible for meeting goals and provided with the tools to do so, including top notch support staff."
good,Being able to collaborate with a very smart group of people has been the best part of my job.  Also having the opportunity to be a part of many very technical challenging systems and applications.
good,The people are great and are definitely willing to assist with any question you may have. This is a self-taught environment making is very difficult to learn and can be very overwhelming.
good,Typical work place if you play hockey then you got it made with the big boss if not then be prepared to get blamed for everything.
good,"Company is going through a transitional period and management is slowly bringing the company to be sold to JPMC."
good,The actual facility is good. They have a full staff cafeteria so you do not have to leave the building for lunch.  Parking is horrible!  The overall workload is unrealistic.
good,Leadership not always in tune with work force.  Work-life balance not always respected.  Changes in upper management seem to occur quite often.
good,Bad benefits package. Worked in an independent office that would be better suited with direct interaction/ guidance from FD direct.
good,"Started out as a decent working environment  then slowly declined. "
good,"First Data Corporation is currently going through major changes, including relocating several offices, to prepare for an upcoming Initial Public Offering."
good,Great place to start great benefits clean place friendly people great atmosphere. wish they hd more picnics and have more holiday fun.
good,Good pay at that time. Good benefits. Decent training. Liked supervisor and most co workers. Good builder with cafeteria.
good,Learn to help others protect consumers privacy. Processing transactions getting the approval codes after verifications of banking customers.
good,"Too many chiefs, everyone is in charge, nothing gets done.  Need to implement working procedures  to make training easier."
good,"I worked with a great team at First Data, however, the upper management could have been better. Each week things would change and we would be unsure about who was reporting to who. There was no such thing as job security or benefits at First Data. If you want a great company treat your employees better."
good,"Its a good place to work, when you want to learn more about team activity, and individual responsibilities. lot of interaction with clients and gather the requirement and clarification on production task"
good,"First data provided me a great opportunity to work on different roles which gave me a chance to learn and grow as an individual."
good,"I began when it was National Processing Co.  Bank of America took over and then First Data.  I had several positions while there.  Once First Data took over, due to ""downsizing"", I and more than half the work force was let go."
good,Tenure means nothing to senior management.  New hires come in at upper management positions without knowing anything about the industry.  Very demotivating.
good,"Good place to work, great co-workers. Great change process in place. Great support from all teams IT, telecom and LOB's"
good,I like working her because i've learnt new things and am current in charge of one of our systems but its time to move on i want a job i can progress in and work towards a career
good,"The company was in a lot of debt and was acting lean and mean, and so quality suffered. Now, they are out of debt, so they may be improving  staffing and systems more. CEO is trying to introduce a lot of new products and innovations. They used to have very good benefits, but to scale back they removed a lot of vacation time, they got rid of matching 401k, and their healthcare plan is not as good as it was before. Many departments were short staffed, and it was hard to get the support you needed from the different departments. For example if you had an installations issue, installations department was really dodgy at helping, or if their was a NOC issue, NOC acted really unhelpful. Due to widespread staffing issues, I often ended up doing the jobs of 6 other departments that I wasn't even a part of, or trained to do those jobs. "
good,"*Typical day at work- I go through all my emails checking for issues or tasks that need to be completed. Also update my task and contact vendors or internal departments for follow ups on ATM removals, installation, line conversions, ATM relocations, transaction disputes and update merchant details were needed."
good,"Great Co-worker, Wonderful benefits and programs to help you advance in your career. Some Management kind of new but everything is a learning experience. Hardest part is the contradicting rules in the SOP guidelines, they fail to mention to you. Typical day is meet your quota and go home and do whatever they say."
good,My experience there was very good. I learned how to do new accounts in different formats and styles. I also learned how to code in different ways.
good,First Data is a good place to start a professional career. You will develop strong analytical skills that will serve you throughout your career.
good,"OK place to work, if you don't mind change.  There are some facets of management that still baffle me (as to why are some of these people still working here) and others that show lots of promise.  Hard to get recognized by your management at times due to reorg after reorg."
good,Not my favorite place to work.... benefits have been cut down... workload has doubled... promises just keep coming
good,"Start work, get a 15 min brake, back o the phone, 30 min lunch, back to the phone 15 min brake go home. Some activities that allow associate participation. Some co-workers are adult some immature other wise okay. Hardest part is being board ad demands pertaining to demands of system and time on phone, most enjoyable point is some of the friend you create"
good,"Productive environment, great team members and was able to work from home. "
good,"enjoyed working with new people everyday, had wonderful hours and schedule. Management was always helpful. Always had options for different things."
good,Would still have been here except for the fact that upper management made bad decisions regarding who to hire as supervisors.
good,I started as a call center employee and was promoted to a response center analyst after 7 years per my choice.  2 months ago I was promoted to client service analyst.  It was a great place to work until new management took over a few years ago.  Management was not the greatest and everyone had their favorites.  The employees that did the most work were not recognized and the ones that did nothing were.
good,Your experiences at FD depends on the department that you are working in and the type of leader or manager you have.
good,This is an environment all about team work. Review of documents.
good,A challenging work to do daily with greta experiences and different areas.
good,problems with IT meant that I personally knew more about their systems than their IT person
good,Friendly environment with amazing people around who can answer any question you have and love to see you exceeded
good,a typical day is to answer calls from cardholders and answer their queries regarding their accounts
good,"It was nice to work their but the work is slow short time ,less than 40.hr don't how long I can stay their."
good,"I would begin my day by sending out a project agenda for that day's calls and ensure that all necessary resources would be attending the call.  Next item would be to send out the project minutes from the prior day's meeting calls and send out individual reminders to individuals with a list of take away items and provide a timeline for them to respond back to me. Complete reports due to Management."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the work was doing research, finding errors and solving it(them). Assisting supervisor with their workload. Training new employee from time to time. The hardest part of the job is co-workers misunderstood the work in the research department when new supervisor hired and gave the training. Most co-workers that were there, not the new hired, are friendly with good attitude. Management holds site meeting once a month, only give order, does not ask for ""input"" or ""problem"" with each department. I learned that when working with computer processing of anything, one must be extremely careful because what goes in, makes a big difference of what the result will become. Each day in the morning we report to the upper management of ""Load"" of work classify them into priority, important, from urgent to not important with deadline to meet. We all do the top priority first and allocate them for each, then if the volume is more than my department can handle, others from other department can help. Sometime it take the entire morning. The afternoon hours will do the least important but also keep in mind the deadline must be met before 5PM."
good,"Great benefits and good pay. Enjoyed ability to structure my day in the way I worked best. Enjoyed daily interaction with clients. The FDMS department was more reasonable in their expectations than in other departments I worked in. Unfortunately, some directors had favorites and work loads were often unbalanced. Some raises were given based favoritism instead of raises being based on actual work performance. Lack of responsibility by some VPs who would sell an idea or service that didn't yet exist and would pass the buck to those who had no control over the situation."
good,This was a great company to work for. The hours are flexible and management is fantastic.
good,"Typical day at first data including data entry and researching items. Management was overall good. Coworkers were great. The hardest part about the job was getting used to new managers, They were always changing. I enjoyed working with my coworkers."
good,Many recent changes for cost-cutting and culture of ownership lead to conflicted and confusing feedback from management.
good,Lacks clear strategy so departments get in each others way.
good,"One of the industry leaders in merchant processing. Fast paced, diverse office environment."
good,"Very fast paced ever changing environment.  Every day is a new day.  I have learned multiple facets of being a manager by creating report trending, quality controls, risk controls, relocating an acquired business, outsourcing, client implementation and retention, and having a productive team.  The management that I worked with were empowering and encouraging.  I worked well with all of my co-workers and we would meet weekly to discuss each others concerns or questions that we would have of the business. The hardest part of the job would be that I was ready for the next steps and was felt complacent in my job.  The most enjoyable part of my job was being empowered by my boss to continue to grow and learn new business areas."
good,"My tenure at First Data has been an incredible learning experience.  I've had the honor of working very closely with some incredible account executives and sales management.  I also have the honor of having a direct manager who truly cared about me and my professional development.  I have formed very tight bonds with my co-workers and hate to think we will be parting ways.  But, with our jobs being moved to another site - it will be something we have to deal with."
good,"if i had to do it all over again i would have never left my last job to come here. the benefits are better than most jobs, but month by month they are taking them away from us to cut cost. suggestion......find a job that has better room for advancement than FirstData"
good,"typical work day consists of checking in with IT daily to ensure systems check on all campaigns pertaining to my department prior to team arriving to work. daily meeting with team members to ensure positive attitude and  set individual goals for the day, check and reply voice mails and emails, review share point for any new updates on department/company policies, 15minute one on one session with manager to review team performance, goals, reports, etc, then perform my regular duties and the duties of my superiors. act as floor support to other teams and ensure deliverable are met. Most enjoyable part of the day is my 15minute break."
good,"Good people to work with, company in a perpetual hire-layoff mode. Executive churn rate exceedingly high."
good,FDC has been an awesome working experience. Its a great place to learn and build your carrier. Have been fortunate working with FDC.
good,Overall a 3 rating since this is a large financial services company with revenue of multi $Billion annually and significant earnings across multiple vertical business and product offerings to National and Regional merchants.  The only problem is due to the large size of the merchant business all transaction processing and sales volumes are reported across many different financial platforms which cause data reporting issues.
good,"I have learned a lot working for First Data."
good,"A typical day at First Data was to determine where I was working that day.  I answered calls, helped set-up credit card machines, added up sales slips for big clients, and to receive complaints.  "
good,We work very hard in the quality department. We listen to calls that the agents take inbound and out to insure the quality is were first data expects.
good,"Busy call center floor and full of young people. The upper management were great, team leads were worthless and the walkers helped ALOT!"
good,"Management is wonderful."
good,"learned a lot about the industry"
good,"Learning how to explain abt the interest rates, especially about daily interest rates on cash taken out on the credit card"
good,"First Data was a growing company with a large market share in Financial Services processing. First 10 years were good, with regular raises, 2 promotions, enjoyable work. Last 7 years the Company has shrunk its staff and cut cost everywhere due to market saturation, recession, and a private equity firm buyout created a large debt load.. Working there has been difficult due to reductions in staff, very few small raises, and less challenging enjoyable work has not been available."
good,This was also a very interesting job. It gave you the other side of what goes on in the credit card industry. We have all had to deal with customer service representatives in life and being on the other end of the call made me respect the representative a little more.
good,"I keyed in data from customers payments into the system for processing."
good,I worked with professional and friendly people. We became a family. I was laid off and that was very hard not only was I  without a job I don't have much contact with my friends that I met along the way. I am a fast learner and I was always willing to take on a new challenge.
good,"I loved the jobs I held at First Data.  I feel our team got along very well, and miss working with them."
good,"Typical day would be answering phones ; maintain confidentiality; Unfortunately, the company was going under a re--engineering at the begininning of the year creating less work for many people."
good,"Analysis of dispute forms for credit/debit cards; face-paced, deadline based environment; inbound/outbound calls to cardholders requesting further information needed for dispute to be processed"
good,I've been there for almost 15 years but have no room to grow.  Been in my position for at least 10 years.  
good,"A typical day is taking inbound and making outbound calls to reprogram small businesses credit card machines. I have learned alot about the different types of credit card machines, and to have good customer service which comes along with patiences. Management is great open door policy able to communicate well with management. Hardest part of my job is knowing by the end of the year I will have to look for another job since they are laying off just about everyone. Most enjoyable part of my job is enjoying the days I have left since I have been in this building since 2006. Talking to different people everyday all across the United States."
good,"Co workers are great.  Ability to work flex hours, and occasional tele commuting.  Good pay and benefits.  Ping pong and gaming area."
good,"Provide technical support,verifying proper hardware and software set up, power cycling equipment, assisting with navigating around application menus and troubleshooting email issues. Deliver service and support to end-users using and operating automated call distribution phone software, via remote connection or over the Internet; Interact with customers to provide and process information in response to inquiries, concerns, and requests about products and services."
good,"answered phones to assist customers with troubleshooting credit card terminals. people were friendly, hardest part of the job was not having enough work through out the day. the most enjoyable was helping people"
good,The call center was extremely busy. Had to keep wait time down to a mininum
good,Needed to be very detail oriented. I learned a lot about multi-tasking. Enjoyed my co-workers and management. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the closing of the branch.
good,I left the company because my Brother was in ICU and I did not have the vacation time to take off to see him. I lost my job because of this.
good,"Pull up daily remedy work orders, start implementing the work to be done. Create a job cut-sheet, a switch or router config sheet, have it peer reviewed."
good,Busy Not boring and most customers are great to work with as well as co-workers.
good,"I learned that every call is always going to be different. I learned to have more patience with certain things and to be more accepting of change. One of the hardest things to deal with, I would have to say, is dealing with irate callers. You really just have to give them their time to explain whats wrong and then try to help them."
good,enjoyed working here.. bonus structure was really good. great opportunity for advancement.
good,"Through first data, i have experienced tremendous hard work and multi tasking from gahering reports/delagating keyers and co employess/completing clarifications/sending transmissions according to cut off time/analyzing rejects/learned various sensitive accounts/ scannning to keying/editing work if necessary/EOD balancing and reporting. I have very well improved my communication skills as well to my co leads, co employess and superiors with regards to issues, updates, turn overs. I like the challenge with regards to critical thinking or to be able to contribute a better way to improve work flow and quality. However, the hardest part is there's just too many tasks to complete with very little resources and co leads to close out or do end of day. On top of that we felt over worked and that turning over some work not completed due to under staffing and resources would be an issue for the next shift."
good,I would sign into my computer to make outbound calls to customer with delinquent credit card accounts.
good,"First Data was the best place to work for when I first started, it soon became a place where they slowly took away the ability to make a very good income."
good,Took calls about credit card terminals and transactions
good,I have very little knowledge about this company. They acquired my company and made basic changes to our operations before I left for another company.
good,Had opportunity to train new employees and enjoyed the enviroment. Learned alot about the credit industry.
good,I would have to say one of my favorite jobs if not my favorite job. I loved the easy going nature of it laid back. I made some excellent friendships while working there met some intriguing people.
good,"Was not committed to the business, offered some advancment opportunitiy, great working enviroment"
good,Absolutely enjoyed my co-workers & management. The job was right up my alley. I learned to use several databases as well as communication with merchants with language barriers.
good,"Process checks from various companies into system using different functions . Compare data with source documents , or re-enter in verification format to detect errors . Ensure payment amount matches stub as well as account holder information ."
good,Dealing with customer service and dealing with people and the product they were using.
good,i enjoyed the hours and the schedule i had. the people i worked with and for were also great.
good,"Organization and sorting of customer payments giving attention to detail when sorting Interact and maintain a positive relationship with personnel in other departments. Motivating employees, maintain production efficencies."
good,"At the time I worked there, the culture and morale needed improvement. Company not focused on employees, only on sales. Our team was laid off and then the lay off was reversed months later."
good,A good time at work depended on the manager you had. It honestly felt like school being told off for just turning around in your chair. I once saw a manAger berate a girl for having her skirt just a little to short despite the girl wearing tights. Workplace culture was a bit hmmm but you will find out when you get there.
good,"Vertigo. Muchas reuniones inconducentes más la complejidad del dia a día. Esto somete a la gente que no está acostumbrada a trabajar bajo presion a un fuerte stress"
good,Overall First Data was a good company to work for.  Great benefits with many opportunities to advance in the company.  The work environment was pleasant.
good,First data has a High turnover rate and random layoffs occur often which made it very hard to concentrate on work and feel secure in your position. Also they don’t pay as high as other comparable companies.
good,"Worked there for bout 10 years, the people are great the management is great, downside is it can be very stressful."
good,"Stressful always a increase in task. Work load is always increasing but salary never moves at the same pace."
good,"Whilst pay is good the work is not stimulating enough for me."
good,"Not a bad company to work for if you like a remote based job with somewhat flexible hours. Residual pay. Commission only after first 90 days. Lots of paperwork"
good,"A typical day at work is ok."
good,It is a descent job. No complaints. You can learn valuable skills. Each day is different I learned a skill set that allowed me to move on to further my career.
good,"you never know when you are getting layed off, they just come to your desk and ask you go to human resources, and in the mean time they are cleaning out your desk, then they bring your things up to HR."
good,This is typical call center.  Each day you receive large volumes of calls from merchants needing assistance. Very repetitive. This is a quick moving environment.
good,I help with inbound calls and assist in questions and assist in answering the questions. I enjoy the people I work with but have a difficult time with my schedule working in the evenings.
good,I worked at First Data for 2 years as a Fraud Analyst. This job was extremely fast paced analytical work. The people and managers that worked there were very nice and they were well staffed.
good,I did not like the mandatory overtime.  Had been on it for about 3 years.  Just thought that was too much. Could not get off of weekends after being there over 7 years because I knew too many skills.  Was very frustrating when new hires were coming in with Monday - Friday schedules.
good,"If you keep to yourself and just work and go home at the end of the day, it is a good place to work...  Do not mingle with co-workers and no social structures at work, then it's great...   Do not gossip!!!"
good,I liked working there because it was good pay. The Quality department has to much say in your Score card even though they do not take calls themselves.
good,"Great place to begin or end a career.  Open door for employees, benefit comparable for region.  Casual dress and large employer of Washington County MD>"
good,I answer questions business owners may have about their business account. The people I work with are great. Not very flexible with time off when needed.
good,"Supporting First Data Point of Sale devices was great. It helps to have some technology experience. Training is very educational."
good,A lot of politics in the work place. A lot of favorite choosing and not promoting the people who truly deserve it. could improve on the culture in the work place
good,"I worked with a wonderful group for the time I was there. Once the reigns were given to the new CEO, a lot changed and many lost their jobs due to reorg."
good,"not a bad place to work. Workplace culture has a lot of red tape, can make things difficult to get done. Younger managers are making changes though  ."
good,"I don't have a review to give. It was nice place to work, but I did not like the salary.  I had to learn many skills and was paid the same salary and not given a raise every year."
good,Very casual and laid back. Learned a lot about how to deal with people over the telephone. Management lacked in training and education. Workplace culture very relaxed. Hardest part of the job was enduring the mundane nature of  a call center duties. The job was for the most part very relaxed and attire very casual. Overtime was in abundance and your earning potential was great.
good,"First Data has always had the potential to be a great place, they have the market share on electronic payment processing and a lot of really cool stuff they do.  However, there is lack of leadership in terms of making it a GREAT place to work.  While the people who work there are all very kind and devoted, it's sad that a few NY investment bankers can take a good business model and make it a less than great place to work and business partner with.  Honestly if you are young by all means come and work for a few years and gain some awesome experience but don't stick around, because things are not likely to change in this over leveraged financial experiment."
good,To many change and no job security.  Stressful. Have a lot if wonderful friends a first data including managers.  Learned a lot at working there .  Not the  best job and not the worst
good,"the review of the temporary employment of first data incorporated that i remember is,i was a production operator.i checked my station machine for proper up keep,trash was picked up around the machine,sweeping,loading products into the machine when shift was starting,searching for new product to stock in the station,putting cut or trim into the trash,filling out work order sheet and some training.i had to check for errors,keep machine loaded with product,some computer work,putting mail into holders with pallet,had to use the pallet jack,quality checks so there were no torn paper into machine holders or finished product.i loaded machine with printed mail roll and put it thru the machine stopped and started it."
good,"It's a good place to work, but you better be aware of it's culture, and make connections, and learn your resources as quick as possible.  management changes a lot.  It's a niche market, and it's all about closing quick in B2B.  The hardest part of the job is making quota, weekly."
good,"The management in First Date was very supporting of your growth.  Responsibilities did require long hours. Normal hours where minimum 50 per week.  Great attention to detail and working with high volume excel, Access files was daily part of the work."
good,With this company I have learned so much. I have taken the time and effort to learn the job in and out. I became the go to person because my work and knowledge stood out and shine over all the agents.
good,"Working at first is a good introduction into the fiancial industry but unless you're thinking of staying there for years, the advancement can be seen as going at a snail's pace"
good,"This company provides paid education at a state university that resides in a building the company owns.  You will work hard but paid well.  The company is highly competitive and deadline driven."
good,i dont feel that this is necessary at this time.  The company is moving its primary builiding to another location that is out of reach for me and my position with no real increase or expected increase to help with the offset.
good,Paycheck kind of job. Not a career even with a bachelor's degree. The job includes good pay for what you do.  Not a very demanding job just very repetitive.
good,"A typical day at First Data would be working Fraud/Chargeback cases and having a daily meeting with our supervisor.  I have learned a lot on credit card processing and the rights merchants, banks, and cardholders have on credit card processing.  The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to have a flexible schedule."
good,I enjoyed working here as my colleagues were great and the management were approachable.  I rotated to quite a few roles during my time here and was grateful for the opportunities.  I also worked several different hours and days which was also flexible.
good,Handled inbound calls that were mostly complaints. The most I learned was to be patient and be efficient. Management was not great but tolerable. The hardest part of the job was quantity first and not quality.
good,"Worked full time for commission pay, tough job but it was a fun time and experience with a great team. As a student, it was hard to balance life and work so I left early in order to stay focused on my main goal as a student."
good,"First Datahas great people andbenefits, however, if you are not someone who likes doing more hours than your regular schedule, there is mandatory overtime that is not told to you until you are trained and on the floor."
good,The training for any position was excellent. Good working conditions and room for growth in most departments. I grew with the company from being a sales rep to management. Most employees were always willing to help you with any issues you may have had. First Data also rewarded top producers with trips.
good,Improving the relationships with the bank partners would help the overall support and partnership. This is a Monday - Friday (50) Plus hour work week.
good,"a typical day at work would involve me having to get to my desk 15mins before i start (unpaid) to get all of my screens set up on the computer. I then need to sign in by my shift time on the dot so that calls aren't waiting for too long. I answer all of my calls and provide customer service to each caller, dealing with their money and accounts and what they would like done with them. after each call i write a memo on the card holders account so that there is evidence of the actions i had taken in which the card holder requested."
good,"Great company, everyone is very easy to get along with and was a very nice start to a career however it is poorly run, if you have any issues that need addressing fast then that certainly isn't going to happen. There are many benefits however such as; extra rate of pay for overtime, extra holidays for overtime, Christmas incentives and also Bravo points"
good,"Only problem is that this is contractor work. It would have been nice to have a longer term assignment with FD."
good,"a typical day at work is fast pace"
good,Enjoyed working with my team that I was on. Company is a merchant processing company with lots to offer to external customers.
good,First Data is a good company to work for.  The people that I work with on a daily bases are good people.  Management are people that have done the job and moved up.
good,"Typical long night but, productive and busy.Learned a lot credit cards, from making to shipping them out effectively.Management was cool at times. Co-worker's were outstanding to work with, love them. Hardest part was 7 days a week working night shift, not being able to see your family. Most enjoyable part was  my co-worker's unbelievable people."
good,"I have had a great experience working for First Data.  However, with all the layoffs, I will there is very poor upper management."
good,"It's very Corporate, too many conference calls, way too many steps to get job done.  Need to work smarter. There is no flow or system implemented for certain positions.  It makes it very difficult to train new employees."
good,"The team I worked with and for was awesome, it's the upper management (many levels above me) that sucked to work for. Constant changes in the management structure was very unsettling."
good,"Researching the state regulation, preparing state reports and reviewing GL accounts. layback corporate culture, and easy going management style."
good,The company somewhat lack organization but they had a great deal of very good managers that cared about there employees work experience on ways to make it better.
good,"I have 30 merchants that I oversee for weekly and monthly billing."
good,"I was in charge of roughly 400 developers of the LinkPoint division and was tasked to develop payment integration solutions for u.a. HomeDepot, IKEA and Microsoft. The company went through restructuring at the end of my tenure and I was laid-off along with many others."
good,On a typical day everyone working a 8hr shift would take between 40-60 calls.  I learned the process of what happens when your swipe your Credit card at a store and how expensive it truly is. I believe I had the best manager and team lead out of the entire building. The management team was around but mainly communicated to the workers through our personal managers. Most days were pretty fun because everyone got along and the leaders were pretty laid back about co-workers chatting as long as they were working. The hardest part of the job was the busiest time which was the first week of each month. Also the % time that we had to be signed in on the phones was extremely high at 97%.
good,"First data is very much a hands on call centre. With two weeks of training, this wasn't good enough. They don't train you to the specification of the job. When the first day of going on the phones come along, it was nerve racking as all the merchants seamed to give abuse constantly. We wasn't trained how to deal with these sorts of issues mentally. Management never seam to be willing to help, and even when you do ask for help, you are frowned upon."
good,answering phones and making calls to check on fraud on debit and credit cards. ive learned more computer skills and alot of customer service skills
good,"I enjoyed working for the company when I thought it was just about helping the clients with questions and concerns they had about their credit card terminals, I just think that to constantly be timed on how long it takes you to do a call and fully help that client but they didn't want the call to take too long and sometimes it just was not that easy. Some calls take a very long time to help the client and that was my top priority.  But if times were not where they wanted them or if you asked questions it was like they hated that.  But I wanted to make sure I gave my customers all the correct information so they did not have to call back if the problem was not resolved."
good,"Client First data is a fast growing company. Syntel has strong bond with client. Client is helpful and ready to achieve big goals."
good,"Nice place to work, but you won't get rich here.  If the pay was higher the turnover would be MUCH lower.  The ammount of knowledge you must retain does NOT match the compensation."
good,"fine place to work, i learned how to handle fraud checks, account services, sort debit and credits checks and make sure it will be deposited to the account of our costumer. i enjoy working with my co-workers because we have teamwork it make our job easier."
good,"The position I hold at First Data allows me to balance work, family, and school.  The Hagerstown site has an extremely talented and dedicated workforce. My team and my business partners are exceptional individuals and I learn and grow with them everyday. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with and projects I get to be involved with.  The least enjoyable part is the current culture of perpetual change. Change is wonderful in that is allows one to grow.  However, perpetual change can be burdensome and stressful."
good,"Great people to work with. Team environment and very helpful colleagues. Unfortunately, the company decided to reallocate their resources in my area and I was given ample notice that my department would be relocated."
good,Very good to me for a very long time.  Full of good people to work with and while it could be very demanding it was also very rewarding at the same time.
good,My review was very complementary on all the new processes I had learned in a very short timeframe.
good,"Changes/reorganizing all the time at First Data.  It was very interesting and challenging at time.  "
good,"fast paced, fun if you enjoy collection, competitive environment, average pay."
good,"The company did not give a great balance between family and work life, or restrictions to be able to work with a medical issue. Was only concerned about the well being of the success of the company."
good,The ability to work from home and the flexibility provided for work/life/family balance was very good at First Data. I enjoy the people I work with. Management needs work. The benefits were good.
good,A typical work day was busy. I learned a variety of different sytems to work my day to day duties. Management was good. Co-workers were excellent. The hardest part of the job for me was learning the many systems to use to perform duties. The most enjoyable part of the job was going home after knowing I accomplished a full day with my duties being done.
good,"At First Data a typical work day is comprised of proposal meetings with merchants, prospecting new accounts, sending follow up emails and phone calls, and entering information into your CRM tool (salesforce)."
good,Too much red tape. Project management within Fd is poorly done.
good,The worlds largest E-Commerce processor. aligned with all the major banks to service merchant and consumers alike
good,I worked as an intern for 3 months and my overall experience was good. Work pressure is there. Other employees and staff were good and friendly . Salary at start is okay for those looking for permanent job
good,"I had an amazing experience learning Serice Cloud at First Data. Implemented an effective Work Case Management System which helped the organization in reducing the turnaround time from 20 days to 7 days. The best part of working at First Data was the amazing team I was working with. I learned Apex coding, triggers, workflows, validation rules, Visualforce pages, profiles, roles, etc. "
good,The stress is not worth it. Quality almost impossible to get perfect score because they nit pick on every single thing. Managers were nice. Got laid off right after my one year anniversary with the company.... lol they let you go at any time without warning. Not worth it.
good,I enjoyed my time at working for First Data. I only parted ways because there was another opportunity to work in the travel and tourism industry. I started in early 2013 and stayed there until 2016. There was room to grow on my account training was excellent and the trainer that trained me left before I left the company months before I did. The benefits were great they offered a very competitive pay rate per hour. The only complaint about the job I had was the type of employees they hired. They didn't have a proper level of professionalism. They hired a lot of younger millennial's and they have a very diverse staff but they were very unrefined. Most people who were there it was there first time in a call center environment in a corporate setting and they were not always prepared to handle the daily challenges of being professional.
good,Offer great opportunity to grow. The management team is always there to help you and make your job easier.  They offer a schedule that works for someone with a family
good,"Good place to work, but no room to grow unless your are very well liked. Supervisor worked different shift, so you had to come in on your day off to actually meet with them. This is a good place to work if you are still in school working on a degree."
good,"First Data is a very successful company that insures their customers are provided with the best customer service by their staff. I had the pleasure of being part of their staff members, as a federal tax payment processor during the months of June 2013 through August 2013. "
good,overall typical day is quick and fast pace. I also enjoyed the fast pace the night went by fast. The harest part about the job was making sure checks was put into the correct stack. Everyone who worked their got along we did alot of group celebrations. I enjoyed coming into work ready to work and still enjoy the team work from other employees.
good,The work is very fantastic because it is about customer satisfaction and service. If your customers are happy for the services rendered to them that motivate you. Enjoy the work as my contributing to my customers and generating profit for my company too.
good,Typical day at work starts at 8:30am till 6:30pm with 1hr. lunch break. Lots of meetings and design/planning discussions. It was a high intensity work environment.
good,"Very stressful place to work. If you walk in there healthy you will leave with health problems. Upper management are great at telling lies. You are just a number. They promote some within but it’s all in who you know:  The pay is great for the area. Benefits are expensive. Loyalty means nothing to them. They lay off so many people with knowledge and once they suck all information from you and get the dirty work done it’s goodbye. Basically, you get screwed. All races, religions, sexual preference and veterans are welcome and accepted. They love to look good on paper."
good,Overall not too bad experience unfortunately I left because of health reasons could have done a better job of helping someone with health issues but other than that they did a pretty good job
good,"First Data for the most part creates an easy working environment however, they don't care whether or not an employee is ready to learn a new product or is uncomfortable with learning a new product. Once the company trains an employee(s) on a new product including what the employee has already been trained in there is no pay increase. CEO promised financial compensation when an employee became cross trained for different products or departments but there is no compensation that has been added."
good,"A typical work day would be to place calls to people in your system to sell credit card machines, rates & plans. "
good,Working on the mids shift was always fun. I made several lifelong friends and family working there. It was a pretty relaxed environment and the benefits and paid time off were extremely generous
good,First Data is a that drive you to produce and driven by sales numbers. Sometimes it can be fun workthere but you must be focus. You are on the phones all day assisting and setting up accounts. Expect alot of changes.
good,"Throughout my time in this job, I had many tasks to do all at once. It was very stressful. However, it made me learn how to efficiently wok at a fast pace."
good,"First Data ued to be a great place to work, but then they started laying people off and consolidating departments. This created a very stressful environment where you never know what service area your next call is coming from."
good,Job was challenging.  Able to learn the functions of equipment software applications.  As company grew to many changes were made not benefiting employees. Began down sizing company and finally shut center down.
good,"I have been at first data for over 18 years and leave now to spend time with my family."
good,"Typical day at work was different yet the same everyday. When the program was there (USAA disputes) we had flex scheduling which was nice. We got credit card disputes daily everyday. the management was great, everyone was friends, it was a quiet place because we were reading about other people's problems."
good,"if you dont accept change well this is not the job for you,  this company requires fast paced and able to work in high stress environment, the salary will more than compensate if you have what it takes. they offer many advancements for career path. they also offer tuition reembursement."
good,"It’s a job, its really hard to move up in this company, but it can be done. pay isn’t all that great for what you do and the coworkers are the only reason you should stay."
good,The workplace culture is extremely competitive. Management reacts to crisis and problem avoidance is minimal. Very frustrating place to work. I would not recommend.
good,Environment is very stressful and depending on the manager you get you may be treated fairly. Started out as a wonderful place to work but then it all started to go downhill.
good,"Dealing with angry merchants is never easy especailly when the system goes down. Overall good not great place. Management lets you do your job. The culture is laid back, expect billing time. I like the fact they undertime where you can leave early if it's not busy."
good,First Data Corp has many opportunities to grow with the company. They provide many benefits to their employees. The best part of the job was the hours I had 6-2:30 and the many friends I made while their. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate merchants who thought that we were stealing their money because of the rates and fees associated with processing credit cards. I learned a lot about credit card processing.
good,This company provided numerous training in customer service and technical support. I supported a team that challenge me to perform and apply everything that I had learned.
good,"My typical day at work was when all of a sudden there was an announcement by the Management that there will be a meeting in an hour. We were waiting the rest of the day, but there was no such meeting. I learned how to deal with customers on the phone, different  cultures. Hardest part of the job was to satisfy a rude customer. The most enjoyable time was to talk to different language operators during lunch and breaks."
good,Good environment to work but sometimes it can be unorganized with work.  Many meetings but benefits are good.  Too many turnovers.  Mail room was a mess.
good,"FDC can be a great place to work, however, since going public, there seems to be too much of a focus on the bottom line and not investing in people/hardware as they should for future growth and stability."
good,"My managers where great throughout my career at First Data, the stability worried me a little but for the most part I enjoyed my time there. The staff was great group to work for , learned a lot from everyone."
good,"Honestly, it is not a bad place to work. There are some pros and some cons just like any other job. They do offer positions with flexible schedules which is a bonus."
good,"The lessons I learned at FD, have served me well over the years.  I am very appreciative of the opportunities I had as well as the people I worked with."
good,"ambiente laboral adecuado."
good,"I enjoyed my ten years at First Data very much. I left the company just before it was taken private by KKR so I cannot speak to the current culture. During my tenure, I had multiple opportunities for advancement and, in fact, advanced rapidly to the VP level."
good,"Sales, Sales,Sales."
good,"My day was taking care of income eligible clients with their utility bills."
good,"Normal as usual routine clock in briefing from supervisor and manager. "
good,I just started here but the pay is great. The people are somewhere friendly. The management his not seen unless in trouble. Wish the workflow managers were ore pleasant.
good,"Due to not being technically minded, I had a difficult time relating to what I was managing.  I rarely understood what was being discussed and therefore had a hard time writing up notes that would give the information needed.  I did get to take advantage of offered trainings and received training in time management, project management and other related areas."
good,"I worked Monday thru Friday 8pm to 5pm"
good,"The point of sale world is constantly changing due to technology which is ever changing the landscape of transactions. There are innovative ways in which people are utilizing transactions and First date is on the ground floor. I have learned a great deal from my time at First Data such as being a team player, encouraging co-workers and building confidence, explaining complicated technical issues so they are simple to understand. Resilience when faced with a challenging project. The hardest part of my job is keeping track of the ever changing technology that becomes available and applying that new found knowledge so things can move effectively (Databases). The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I am a part of something bigger than myself and partially responsible for keeping businesses up and running."
good,"The culture at First Data around people I work with is amazing. We are all great team players and can always count on each other. The VP of accounting department is a great leader than demands a lot but also teaches us a lot and rewards for the job well done. The job itself is interesting and very challenging and that is what i love about it, you will never be bored."
good,"Learned valuable business skills; such as written and verbal communication, computer skills, negociation and collabrorating with clients to meet their needs and business demands."
good,The job is a lot of fun the work is very easy and interesting it gives you the chance to see what goes on behind the scene of the whole card fraud world and how things are processed.
good,My time at First Data was ok. I have had better employers. I'm not saying that its a bad place to work  My reason for leaving is that im being laid off.
good,"Great place to work, but currently undergoing organizational changes which is creating a lot of anxiety in the workplace."
good,"This is a Mail processing company with 3 shift and mare than 100 staff, I work in the retail section by helping my co- workers with their jobs and take care of the work for the smooth running. We work as a team and this help us to achieve our goal day to date."
good,"Co workers are easy going & great to get along with. "
good,"Upon arriving to work, I check my postings from the previous days work. Next, I check my emails and voicemails. Then I go through my work file to locate the accounts that is priority to work for that day. I have been with the company for a long time, and I've learned that all people are different, therefore I look for personality in a person to determine the best strategy to use to make the person feel accomplished. The management  team is great. My co-workers are my family. The hardest part of the job at this time, is the work is very slow. The most enjoyable part is when there is money to be made."
good,"The old First Data was definitely a 100% in my book.  Since KKR, the whole culture has changed.  However, I must admit, there is quite a lot to learn from this company and it is a good way to get into the industry and move on, if you can."
good,Good place to work and ideal workplace for Fresher candidates.
good,"A typical day at First Data was, setting the mail machines up for running the bill statements for accurate delivery. I learned how to troubleshoot on the consistent errors the machines caused. Management was not so helpful when it came to being questioned about the work. Co-workers weren't as friendly either. No team work was put to effort. The hardest part of the day was to keep the machines up and running without errors."
good,"Easy work, but not very good pay.  Used to have great benefits, but that's been cut.  Used to take good care of employees, but no so much anymore."
good,Gained extensive knowledge working for First Data which included project management across eight processing sites located in the U.S.
good,Gained various experience in Issuing and Acquiring platform.
good,"Using a telephone and computerized database to assist merchants with customer service inquires, payments etc."
good,The most enjoyable part was exceeding merchants and vendors expectations
good,"a typical day at first data consist of assisting merchants with their accounts from processing a credit card to having problems with the terminal. ive learned that you cant satisfy every merchant. my co workers were nice although they made it seem like it was a problem to ask them. the management was terrible. the hardest part of the job was it being so repetitive, but i enjoyed making peoples life easier.   "
good,"I have worked for First Data for seven years this June.  I learned all aspects of the payment processing industry.  My co-workers were all great, fun people to work with.  The hardest part of the job was not letting it get to you outside of work.  A lot of the clients that we deal with are not happy and take it out on us individuals although they are angry with the company.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people that I got to work with.  The only bad thing is the room for growth with the company and the management.  The room for growth is only an option if you know people to put in a good word for you or already know someone in the area that you are trying to grow into.  I also noticed a lot of favoritism with the management.  Every department and manager is different though so this was not with every manager I knew there.  "
good,"Collections, Customer Service, Process credit card and draft. Follow up with customers."
good,I enjoy working at First Databank because our daily tasks help to ensure patient safety in regards to pharmaceutical data and medical knowledge.
good,Enjoyed the job with my ability to interact with clients on calls. The company is too layered with non sales related matters that get in the way of acheiving goals.
good,"I enjoyed being able to come into work and stay extra hours, to enable me to leave early on fridays. First Data taught me all of the data entry skills that I have today. The hardest part of the job, was some of the co-workers did not have a team effort attitude. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flex-time."
good,Great place to work if you enjoy sales.
good,It wasn't a bad place to work.  Managers were great and understanding.  Definitely a company of diversity.  The working environment is what kept me working for the organization as long as I had.
good,"A typical day at work is very stressful. We don't have enough time to notate the merchant's account. We constantly being micro manager down to the minute. As an entry level employee, you are treated like a robot instead of a owner's associate. Managers don't promote because of performances but because of work friendships. "
good,"First Data was a fine place to work if you enjoy working in a call center atmosphere. They had good benefits, made their expectations of you and your performance clear, and provided some perks, such as free coffe, juice, and light snacks."
good,"Working At First Data I learned a lot about how credit card companies work. I analysed credit and debit card disputes. I didn't mind the job, it just was a lot of work and I felt over worked for the amount of pay. I had mandatory overtime constantly. I cannot remember a time when I didn't have a normal 40 hour week. I was only supposed to have 200 cases, but when I left, I was pregnant and had 600 cases or so. I was very good at what I did, therefore I was given more cases, and that was frustrating. I have a good attitude so I didn't complain,and perhaps that was my fault. There were simply not enough people working to get the cases done. I felt it would make more sense to hire more people. Instead, there were lay-offs. This was very stressful and scary. I enjoyed the job because I got to solve problems and help people get their money back. The hardest part of the job was trying to call people back, there simply wasn't enough time to call people, I had too many cases. I think I would go back to a job like this if I could be promised to work only 200 cases, which is what I was told in training. However, there is no way they could promise me that. And that's why I chose not to come back after having my first baby. The stress of the job was too much to continue and I decided it would be best to chose a job that would be more enjoyable to have a happy and healthy life."
good,"I usually start my work at 7:30 am , collaboratively plan my day and make sure that the most urgent work gets done first."
good,Contractors are isolated from employees.  As a project manager not having a readily available org chart was challenging.  Not a very friendly environment
good,"I learned a lot while there but the company does not mentor or support diversity ,a lot of favoritism between perks and management. Lack of training in regards to company rules, company policy,the use of the software and how to interact within the software when boarding new accounts, company fails to tell you what should not be done from the beginning to avoid problems . Company does not write up or warn employees before firing them,they don't have a clear policy regarding the board of new accounts."
good,I wish not to speak on First Data. Each Manager is different and my experiences may not be other experiences with First Data. Each employee have to come up with that decision from their experience.
good,"Learn how manage team and  improve productivity "
good,"Good people to work with, senior leadership could work on benefits a little bit more. Benefits are not competitive with the industry and generally have above average cost for below average coverage and services. Internal technology has tons of issues for users and could be more accessible. Making requests for anything is a genuine nightmare for the non-technical professional."
good,It’s a great place to work. They honestly help you advance if you want it. I just started at a temp lower then usual too a long time to be paid what I was worth. I learned a lot and will miss the experience.
good,"Okay experience. Too many responsibilities for how much pay. After another analyst was fired, I was expected to pick up all of the extra slack with no kind of compensation or potential solution in sight."
good,"very fast paced, hardest part of the job is that you're doing the same exact thing everyday. very nice people that  work there and are always ready to answer any question that you may have."
good,"I loved this job too bad it was a temp job.  If I wouldn't have gotten hurt i definitely would have pursued the positions.The pay was the best, they took care of their people."
good,"I answered phone calls and assisted the merchants with the issues they were calling about either terminal support or their funding and "
good,"Quality Analyst for Boarding Representatives working in India and US."
good,"Laid back type of atmosphere. As long as you did what was required of you they had no need to micro manage. You were free to do your duties without being questioned. Open door policy if needed assistance in any area. Friendly and professional people. "
good,"Decent place to work.  Management is supportive and will help if you ask.  It's very difficult to break into the teams and get help and often times I've been turned away from team members while asking questions because they are ""too busy"" when I feel it's just a lack of want to help.  I've pretty much taught myself the ropes and have been teaching myself through research and videos."
good,"I work on the SalesForce team, for First Data Resources which is a leader in the back office administration of credit card transactions"
good,"There is a fantastic work/life balance at First Data. The company is very understanding about flexible scheduling for sick time and personal issues which makes First Data a great choice especially for people who have children.  This compensates somewhat for the complete lack of benefits. "
good,"Updated merchants account and routing number due to fraud or bank change"
good,"in at 9am out at 6pm with an hour for lunch. fantastic benefits package and out of this world compensation package. Salary plus commission. weekly and monthly sales contests to win 50 inch flat screen TVs, $100 giftcards and more. Offsite team building exercises every month!"
good,"Working at First Data was an experience. I never worked for such a messed up company and that was there was not good COMMUNICATION between company, management and employees."
good,A typical work day includes downloading company files making sure all item that come into the building are properly entered and processed correctly. Management is good has its ups and downs but normally good to me because i respect authority. Co-workers for the most part are great no complaints. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help others when the call on me for assistance.
good,"My job is answering phones and helping the merchant with their questions. The Management and co-worker and excellent to work with and are understanding."
good,"I work in a very busy office, no day is the same. I work with a really great management team and i love the team i help run. I have learned so much in my 6 years at First Data and i am grateful for all opportunities i have had."
good,Worked my way up.  Great opportunity if you have a willing Director to help you take it to the next level.  I would have retired from this company had they not moved so much of the Company to NY.
good,Self managed position that rewards hard work.  Some days are long and some are not.  It is a rewarding experience.
good,"FGR bought Bank of America Merchant Services division in 2011.  For two years they stated they were keeping the site open, they transferred the business over in 2012 and at that time when they had full control announced they were transferring the assets to other states and severanced everyone deemed non essential out.  Those in essential roles such as myself were asked to stay and perform our functions till the final transfer which happened April 1 2013. To date they have still not transferred the remaining assets."
good,"went through a training program, was very prepared when started the job.  Was fun meeting people from all over the United States."
good,The one thing i will miss is my customers. They had different personalities and they will had all different kinds of businesses.
good,Updated all customer service representatives' catalog with new information regarding credit card services.  Management was mostly fair. The most difficult and enjoyable part was trying to maintain accurate updates and other changes regarding credit card services.
good,I answered inbound phone calls. Handled general customer service questions about merchant accounts.
good,"You learn patience and how to deal with drama. It does have its downfalls there is a lot of drama amongst co- workers but if you can avoid it, its a fime place to work"
good, Call Center.
good,a busy but fun place to work especially working with the co workers that i had attention to detail was a big part of the work day
good,A typical night at work consisted of keying in numbers and making sure all information was complete.
good,A very detail job with many things to learn. My coworkers are teamplayers and very focus on the quality of the work. I have learn alot in this industry.
good,I currently provide data entry to external customer by balancing their accounts for various companies. I've been trained in multiple departments. I am one of the fastest keyer and my supervisor calls me a stellar a my job.
good,"I love the people I work with. A typical day of work is going in every day logging into the phone and taking calls. Every day is different so you never know what you're walking into.Something I've learned is that if you think you're right most likely you are just be more confident in your answers. There are some days that are a cake walk. Some days there are several calls with several angry people , angry that they had to wait to get to you, only for you to need to get them somewhere else. There is a great sense of accomplishment when you make someone's day. When you turn their cruddy day into a great day. The hardest part of the job is balancing the hold time , aux /after call time , and quality of the call. If you're willing to deal with the stress of never knowing how the call is going to go then it'll be a perfect job for you. You do have the opportunity to move around in the company, you will need to be with the company at least a year for some departments."
good,"First data Corporation is outsourcing agency that provide IT services to the multiple clients. However, Duties and responsibility are too much to a single employee. I'm the one only in duty on night shift and handle more than 2000 employees. I'm stayed for 2 years on this company due to people in environment(Client or operation) is good and friendly. However, my career is stuck in one side because management is not preparing for future improvement to the employee."
good,"Not bad for what it is, a call center environment.  The people are pretty good and it isn't overly stringent like other places i've worked. Unlimited overtime depending on the account you are working.  Same with call volume."
good,I think the most enjoyable part of the job is that you learn from the best to be the best. Its a highly stressful job based on how much work needs to be done. Management is good.
good,Job wasn't bad at all I love when I help the customers news happy and wanted to speak with my supervisor I didn't like the ones that cussed me out and complained and said negative things to me but that came with the job is so long I was a pretty nice place to work that I just wished to pay was better benefits wasn't bad though
good,"This is a good fast pace company to work depending where you are located."
good,"I actually really enjoyed my time at First Data. I worked for the TeleCheck product in Houston, Tx. The team I worked with was wonderful. Unfortunately, First Data is going through some changes which has necessitated several lay-offs of which I was a victim of one. Overall I would rate First Data as average. Most of my ratings are based on my experience in the Houston Tx. office."
good,"This company really depends a lot on the department you work in. The benefits and compensation aren't that great, but the company overall isn't too bad."
good,Great team to work with and always constant change. Great Senior Management team. Month-end timing needs improvement
good,"Management was hands off"
good,the company showed how to work with all people and changes  that comes with a  compay. I learned a lot for this company and i am thankful for what i have learned
good,"good company to work for, the people are the best asset. There is always a challenge to resolve at FD so keeps you on your toes, but when issues pop up people are willing to work together."
good,"good company with great leaders and infrastructure. But after working with long time will not get chance of growing in the company."
good,"I currently work an 8 hour shift. I'm responsible for doing a variety of duties. I process actual plastic credit cards and input data in pc regarding customers information. My co-workers are easy to get along with as well as management. The hardest part about my job is accuracy. You have to ensure all of the work is completed at 100%. The easiest part about my job is inputing data in the computer. Overall First Data is a great company to work for, but I need I job that's more challenging."
good,I liked the hours and the overtime this job offered .The location was awesome less than 5 minutes away from my home and daycare.
good,Typical day at work on the telephones was exciting and each call was a new experience. I learned how to download and operate a credit card machine. Management was very lax on daily activities and employee concerns. Co-workers were very helpful. Hardest part was sitting all day and not able to getup and move around if need be. Best part of my job was getting to assist customers on the terminals that they were using. Each call was a different issue that we needed to solve.
good,"A typical work day would be 8-10 hour days, some being 12 hours, and some of the overtime was mandatory. I loved my job, I loved the people I worked with. It was a great atmosphere."
good,Its quite a good company and would recommend it to a guy who is looking for a short time experience in Systems engineering. There are free snacks for everybody there.
good,"Star was extremely good to their employees and I would definitely give it a 5 star rating.  Star gave us everything that we needed to be successful at our responsibilities and quotas.  First Data acquired Star and the benefits did not change, however, we were moved in inside account executives and it was very hard to compete with the competition when they are face to face with our clients.  I then moved to Fiserv."
good,A typical work day is very fast paste. I've leaned to be very produtive on various machines in different fields. Management is always productive and there when u need them at all time. My co-workers are like little working bee's when it comes to pushing the work out on time. The hardest part is fixing the machines because u never know what part is fixable.
good,They have good health and dental benefit and vacation time. the work was fast past keep you moveing. The night shift was great to work because i could take care of things in the day time.
good,"It's been beter than 10 years since I have worked at First Data, but I did enjoy it. It was my first major Admin/Accounting job. A comfortable place from what I can remember."
good,"Working at First Data is good, However, the work itself takes a long time to get use too. Being in a call center you have to follow specific  procedures."
good,"This is a good job, but you have to be able to handle people not always being nice on the phone. It can be stressful because there is a lot of information to learn."
good,"I have learned a lot there. Things I had no idea about. It really opened up a new view on the world for me. I enjoy all the people I work with there, they're all very friendly and helpful."
good,"As EMV Laison a critical role ensuring our Partners where up to date with all EMV Certification Requirements."
good,"Fine work environment, don't feel like I get paid enough its a global company and my department pays the lowest but we do a lot of work, the benefits are phenomenal but its a very busy job"
good,"A typical day is filled with numerous, and sometimes overwhelming, telephone calls. Coworkers are great to work with and management is pretty reasonable. Depending on which department you work in, the hours are very good for balancing work and personal life. The health benefits could be better."
good,If you need a job right away this is somewhere I would recommend for you to apply and interview. But if you want to make a career in advance this is not it
good,"Always was; always will be.  Management changed to running the company by stock price.  Lost confidence of staff, Lost sight of customer.  Unable to innovate because of lack of partnership with clients, and innovation means making mistakes to discover unworkable prototypes.  Mistakes are not learned from; they are actively punished."
good,"Management was horrible. there was no work/life balance. Management always overbooked and techs got stuck working mandatory ot with zero thanks.. When I started they wanted us to sell one thing per day. By the time I left they were wanting us to average $15 per work order. We received no extra pay for this. We had 6 metrics to meet but all they cared about was $/work order, which wasn't even one of our metrics.. I was the top tech of the month one month but all I heard about was how my $/work order sucked. We were sent out to work in any weather conditions with no thought to our safety. When techs would bring our concerns up in weekly meetings we were told they would look into things- they never did. The health insurance was horrendous with a 2500 deductible. Once the deductible was met they only would pay 80%, not 100%.. The only decent thing was getting every channel for only $20/per month."
good,"•	As pare of a multi functional help desk we handled a verity of calls related to Tech support, Customer Services, Field technicians, partner service teams, escalation support."
good,I only worked there for a short period of time but it was relaxed and slow paced since I worked from 3am to 7am most days.  I learned a great deal about customer service while working at First Data.
good,"A very good company with much to provide their customer base.  They have many problems leading from the executive management suite but very strong secondary executive leadership.  Working at FDC is being treated as a lump of coal as for work life balance but they pay you as if you a diamond if you are productive.  If you after the fast track, advancement and big dollars take the risk.  If is not for a family person, long hours, high stress but good benefits for the winners."
good,fun work environment
good,"First Data has a lot of great employees and good products.  However, their management from the top down is lacking and needs a clear strategy.  Sad to see such a good company struggling so much."
good,I like to think that they could manage to be more fair to employees and notchange up their actions every 2 months to fit the ceos needs to a bigger advancement
good,Take calls for the the EFTPS and assist callers with the website and taking payments.
good,"As an international operator, I got to call all over the world. It was a nice place to work and would like to work there again if they hadn't shut the business down in my area"
good,"Over all First Data is a good company, but some of the IT Management is work. The CEO when he first came on made it very clear everyone is human and no one should be afraid of coming into work and loosing their jobs. Management team I worked for did not believe in that. They also did not believe in Life/Work on the our side they said 40hrs is the thing of the past. 50/55 hrs is the new standard."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the some of the people you work with. Its important to know and understand the great benefits that come with this job. Don't work here if your not serious
good,"Always changes - which is good, we learn from change. The new direction they are heading is unclear.  It appears they do not care about employees any longer."
good,"Petty rules about what was allowed on your desk as if a child was infuriating.  Could not have a book even though you were not reading it and it was stacked on the side, could not have certain type of snacks, same with drinks, was monitored on talking even when there were no calls.  You were supposed to sit facing forward and ignore your seatmates read or do anything when there were no calls."
good,The typical day of a contact center team lead can be hectic. You learn to deal with irate customers and stressed out associates but if you can manage that there are a lot of programs First Data offers that can help you grow as an individual. Co-workers can be difficult but it is all in how you handle it.
good,"Initially things were great, once First Data changed hands things went downhill quickly. Benefits and job security were lacking, there was little to no care about life outside of the job."
good,I learned a lot from this team and hated to leave them however they taught me so well that I outgrew that position and had to go elsewhere to get the promotion i deserved because the company doesn't have growth in their plan.
good,"My main duties in this role included processing customer claims in an office environment using multiple computer systems to process claims. Quality checking work produced by colleagues. Making decisions based on financial information provided. Updating internal systems and databases. Managing all paperwork ensuring Date Protection is adhered to following all FSA guidelines and procedures. Good management. Nice co-workers, made a lot of friends. Manual calculators have to be the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is rewarding mis-sold customers."
good,"Managment not so good, for contractors no benefits at all. Also they force all contrantors to take 3 week off during winter holidays. But the dev team was good enjoyed  to work with them."
good,"On a typical work day,I always tried coming in starting out on a good start because its a very productive type of job,and that's how your scored as an employee on a daily basis.I always tried to stay focused on my work to keep errors from occuring and make sure my work was accurate.I have always enjoyed lockbox and the different challenges it offered.I have been working in lockbox a quite long time for different companies so everything is pretty easy for me,and I'm quite familiar with all positions.I would very much love to learn other positions as well to expand more of what I know."
good,"A relaxed place to work, with good work conditions and nice people. Systems seemed to be outdated and there are pressures from management regarding speed in handling calls."
good,"fat paced phone inbound customer service handling account queries and setup of remote credit card reader equipment."
good,I worked at First Data for only a couple months.  My machine seemed to get deliberate malware on company shared drives.  I even ingested some water that cause left and right quadrant abdominal pain....

good,First Data is one of the leading companies providing financial services support on a global level. Things change on a daily basis and I do applaud First Data for their efforts to keep employees up to speed with the changing business sector.
good,"Not bad company to work, but there no any benefits for contractors at all and management could be better, but office in Omaha pretty good and good environment for work."
good,"It was ok. Cant really move up even if they say after 6 u can apply for diff positions."
good,"Embora tenha iniciado suas atividades com proposta de se  posicionar de maneira diferenciada das principais concorrentes no mercado no seu segmento, ao decorrer dos primeiros meses, se mostrou com os mesmos modelos e praticas na sua gestão."

good,Loved my job but every day is repetitive . There's no room for growth its people thats been here 10 years with only a $2 raise and 10cent raises every year
good,Loved working there until company began off- shoring jobs.  Once this began employees were constantly on pins and needles worrying about job security.  Additionally FD wanted to reduce attrition which resulted in them keeping less than stellar performers.
good,Fast paced environment. Deadlines have to be met on a timely manner.  You have to be focused with minimal interruptions to perform your job well. You have stock options. You get rewarded bravo points for a job well done
good,"A typical day at work is to interact with merchants and solve their problems. I learned to research a customers account to see how to help them increase their revenue. The management was good and the culture laid back. The hardest part of the job was when the site closed, the best part was the freedom the job provided to do your work."
good,Pay is GREAT. They treat you like a friend. Very understanding about your situation as well. This will be my first job and it’s probably the best decision I could have made.
good,"The company had great BONSUES, an amazing team and I was able to make some excellent friends."
good,"Application Development"
good,"First Data is a woonderful company to work for that pays a competitive wage and offers a full benefit package. The cons is that, depending on the department you work in, they are not big on training for the position you apply for. The management is constantly changing, as well as the rules. And most of the time employees are left with unrealistic expectations on job requirement."
good,FirstData is a great place to begin a career but there is not much room for advancement. The work culture is laid back but professional. The management staff provides feedback on performance and provide incentives when necessary.

Co-workers were great to work with - overall the department was efficient and well balanced with seniors and newbs.  Training sessions were constantly cut short to get folks back on the phones.  Makes you feel that the company doesn't care about employee improvement - just care about the customer.  Happy, well trained employee is a good productive employee people!"

First Data seemed to be having some morale issues but I still enjoyed working there.  The problem is that now they are doing another consolidation and closing another office (which happens to be my office) they did this after taking away several perks from the employees such as business casual summer dress, 401K matching, and a terrible health insurance plan.  On top of all of this they also took away flexible hours which now forces multiple groups to come in at the same time as everyone else regardless of the fact that they can't begin work till later in the day or that they should be able to come in early and still complete on time and get out early."
good,It is a general production job. I learned how print statement and letter using proper ink and toner. I do not have good co-workers at that job

good,Everyday was a new day as the industry was always changing.  It made for a interesting job environment as you did not feel like it was the same process each day and made it exciting.
good,"The job was very rewarding in that it provided needed child support to custodial parents. I like the high volume of work and the incentives that we received for achieving production goals, the contests made it fun and pushed us to be more speedy and efficient. The most difficult part of the jobs was trying to read the handwriting on some of the disbursements and making sure they got to the right recipient, because many of the names were the so common, like Smiths, Gonzalez etc...I can't say what was most enjoyable but I really liked that it was a graveyard shift for that type of work.

good,"The company knows how to work hard, and it knows how to have fun as well. We often set many goals and then we would celebrate if we meet those goals. The managment was wonderful and knowledgeable. The vice president was one of the best and most personable executive I have ever met. We have a set schedule and goals for each day. And the job environment was something I wish could have lasted longer."

good,First Data is not a bad place to work for ambitious and educated individuals
good,"Although I was an independent consultant, this company offers good training and support. The underwriting team was available to work with which in some ofther companies that is not the case."
good,The hardest part of this job was keeping the pace of daily quota of production.
good,"Expected to work 50+ hours a week, Pay was good but work life balance was way off. Local leadership was reactionary to Senior leaders ever changing requirements, no to hard for someone else to do environment."
good,There are a lot of great people here the only issue is the old guard VP's that tend to micro manage and not take responsibility.  Clover is a great product though.
good,"First Data is a good place to work. The culture is fast paced but not necessarily stressful. Help is always there when you need it, and the people are excellent to work with."
good,Each team member felt like their coworkers had their back and were always happy when one of them succeeded.  C Level management were out of touch with the employees and kept taking away the benefits.  What kept most working there was their coworkers.
good,Awesome compensation but lacks managerial professional development.  Manager retention is extremely high.  Learn all you can in the two week new hire training classes.
good,I would have liked to have begun my career at First Data years ago when I was younger. I wish I had more history with the company.  Everything is very technical and I don’t feel as capable of an employee as I would like to be.
good,"Uma boa empresa para se trabalhar, bons benefícios, ótimo para se aprender e se desenvolver no entanto as oportunidades de crescimento profissional e plano de carreira são praticamente nulos, tem beneficios mas o salário para quem esta abaixo da estrutura global é pessimo, não há interação alguma entre diretoria e funcionários especialmente os que fazem parte da estrutura global ..."
good,Prejudicial management.  The hardest part of the job was getting training to achieve advancement.  The most enjoyable part was common goal production.
good,First Data is a fast pace constantly moving environment.  The only thing consistent is change.  Frequent site closings and layoffs.  Unique business process.
good,If one loves prospecting and cold calling than this is the ideal place to work and make relationships.  The company has aggressive sales goals and at the same time reward with incentives.
good,Its a great company to work for if your starting off your career. I was able to get my foot in the door and and learn alto but the work life balance is horrible.
good,"Not a bad place to work although more like a banking institution with titles and pay, high title and low pay.  Leadership is positioned however a lot of them."
good,The company was a positive experience and helped transition from college to working in an office environment. It was a quiet environment which allowed you to easily focus on your task and the management teams were excellent at encouraging growth.
good,I liked the work over all but I do not like on calls on night.  I learnt Unix and Linux.  Learnt Deployment and On call procedure.  I liked the job what they are doing.  It is interesting.  I leant credit card and gift card processes.
good,"Challenging environment where you can learn a lot, especially about Information Security. Good people, and talent generally works together to get the job done."
good,"As a normal day it is a company were employees’ works as a team to solve the customer requirements every day. The main philosophy of First Data is that customer services is first all the time.

good,I enjoyed my time there. They had great benefits and offsite team building days each quarter that were lots of fun and contributed to the team spirit.
good,First Data has been a very good starting point for myself but feel I have gained enough knowledge to branch out. I have learnt a lot of the 3 years I've been there but want to learn more and progress which I can't do within my area of work at First Data.
good,I took the position at First Data after getting laid off from a position after 15 years.  My salary with First Data was literally half of what I was making and not in my career field.  It was a good learning experience with something different than I had done before.  I only planned to stay at my hired position for 6 months then post to an Account Manager position which is where my experience was.  The VP in my Department changed the policy so you had to be in your job  one year before posting.  I ended up finding a position in my chosen field  making twice as much so I left.
good,My job was eliminated without a chance to find another position.   I struggled getting to know the organization.  I trained my replacement without the knowledge it would lead to my job being eliminated.   I was just starting to get into the swing of things and feeling productive when my job was eliminated.
good,Available upon request - to be provided. Fast paced competitive environment - rapidly changing objectives and requirements- flexibility requires. That is all for now in this section.
good,A call center is a different environment to work in.  you meet some good people and there are some good managers  Depending on the position it can be very hectic and fast paced.

good,"In the Corporate world, change is inevitable. Brace yourself as some changes are for the better, and some aren't. Take all the responsibility you can get as your job depends on how much of an asset you are to the company."
good,I like that I get to wear jeans to work. However the pay is low. Stressful environment where many jobs are being cut and the load of many is being given to fewer.
good,Started out as a great family oriented company believing in life/work balance but grew away from that philosophy with change in management.  Good benefits and salary.
good,"Pros- Experience you can gain will allow you to go either in the technical field or banking field."
good,"Large company and many opportunities for advancement."
good,"Good company to work for, but management sharing information about policy changes was poor. Communication was not always optimal, and standards were very high, but accomplishable."
good,extremely high turnover of employees. First Data set very high quality requirements of the employees increasing the stress on the employees with no consideration to the amount of changes to job description on a daily forum.
good,The people at First Data were a pleasure to work with.  My job was a pleasure to do at First Data.  Each day was different and there was something new to learn each day.

good,"Great company to work for and great benefits."
good,"Great co-workers and very flexible work and life balance. Big company that acts like a startup since the last few years have all been about the IPO. Many benefits cut, many jobs cut and many offices shut down. Three years of lost benefits, no matching 401k, and constant ""budget cuts"". Seemed completely impossible to move up with the company, especially in the last few years since they had to hire so many executives and of course support the IPO. After 18 years of dedication, I was laid off due to an office closure that helped support the IPO. Thanks for nothing First Data!"
good,"My typical day at work is answering emails from clients and seeing them through to resolution."

good,"This company was good to work for in that they offered opportunities for advancement, training, good benefits and plenty of challenges to keep a person interested.  A regular day for me was always different, considering my position with them.  I learned a great deal from the training and from everyday experiences such as how to handle conflict, creating win-win situations, negotiating for positive outcomes and managing, both directly and indirectly. The hardest part of my job was switching gears to manage the myriad facets of my position.  I enjoyed working with the legal cases and motivating my employees. There were times when upper management tended to treat people like numbers instead of as individuals with differing needs and qualifications."
good,"Good company to work, professional and very nice people...Work-life balance is fairly optimistic but no work from home"
good,"Work from home was eliminated which forced hundreds to take a package.  Losing a lot of talent."
good,The company is changing its culture and becoming very top heavy. In the process it is losing valuable employees who have subject matter knowledge of the business.
good,"First Data has a reputation for cycles of hiring/layoffs.  The company was acquired by a private equity firm just before the economic downturn, and has recently pushed to return to a publicly-traded entity.  A new CEO was hired (excellent) and created a lot of senior management changes.  As expected, large layoffs occurred shortly thereafter.  Although I felt the salaries remained pretty competitive, many employee benefits were recently slashed (personal vacation days, 401K, healthcare).  Employees are smart & talented and the mid-level leadership (VP, director) was excellent."
good,Good place to gain IT knowledge. Recruits internal candidates.

good,"Every work day was exactly the same."

good,"I monitor calls everyday. provides feedback to the customer service representatives and this is our chance to know each other and observe agent's behavior. I get to know how to be an effective leader, talk with our clients.

good,"I work with a national client base of an assigned portfolio to retain and upsell to clients. Serve as main point of contact for all contract negotiations, troubleshooting and all financial aspects concerning Visa/MC interchange. Most difficult part of position is the long legal process on changes for Visa/MC while the most enjoyable section is working directly with the client to help their business save economically on their interchange costs.  "
good,"First Data was a fast paced, changing environment. It provided me the opportunity to continuously learn new technologies and develop staff to improve their careers."
good,"Nice people but always work pressure is usually in higher side, at least in IT system section"
good,the benefits were great the job was not hard to do the management was ok but did things backwards that didn't make any since still do but what can u do as for moving up in the company good luck with that five years with them was passed up for every promotion i put in for so there u go u have a better chance of hitting the lottery then advancing with them.

good,Many opportunities for advancement. Values their employees.
good,"Great place to work, very busy ,days just went by so quickly. Helping a team to achieve their goal was fantastic.

good,"•	Answering calls and various queries from existing merchants regarding their accounts"
good,I worked for Firstdata for 4 years through a vendor and I felt the work could have been more exciting if the management is open to change the technology for software development.

good,"I learned to work under pressure and also the time management. First date has a supportive leadership. The approach is very professional, highly motivated work culture. Long working hours."
good,"This is a great place to get your career started.  It will allow you to get some experience that you cannot get anywhere else, but it is not a place to stay.  There is very little work life balance and it is very disorganized.  You will need to create your own process documents if that is something you need.  You need to create your own training documentation if that is something you need.  Very little will be handed to you."
good,"Great people to work with, but management is a different beast entirely. As long as you do your work and are efficient you're left alone for the most part."
good,I really enjoy my position with the company.  Unfortunately I am only a temp and a full time position is not being offered due to budget restrictions and the recent sale of the company.  I am only looking for other employment out of necessity due to my contract ending.
good,I found interesting challenges and pleasant co-workers.  I was able to expand on my interests and abilities in the company.  They do cultivate a competitive environment and also a vast amount of educational resources that they make readily available to all employees.
good,"When I joined the company, there was balance between mission focus, company profit, and employee satisfaction. Over time, employee benefits were reduced and the sole focus was on the bottom line and employees were managed as disposable assets."
good,Lots of opportunities presented within 10 years - Corporate ladder is strong - Enjoyed employee resource group participation and networking opportunities presented - High expectations with little time in day

Many changes throughout my tenure but have no regrets - I learned a lot and valued my relationships within the company.  Close knit -  growth related family environment.
good,"foi uma experiencia, a empresa tem um perfil muito bacana ainda mais para quem esta no inicio da vida profissional"
good,"I loved working at First Data. The only thing I would like to see change is the lay-off factor. It was the best place I've worked, to date. Management is awesome!"
good,"Worked for FDC for many years. Once in the command center thought they never presented any career path out of it. Some people did find their way out and into server and administration. They do present ways to educate yourself or pay for school through the job. "

good,It’s a good every day work place or for individual looking to get into a corporate structure.  Management is generally pleasant to work with and workloads tend to be reasonable.  Health benefit my be lacking but stock options and bonus attempt to make up for it.  Once Middle Management is achieved it is very difficult to receive pay increases or obtain promotions due to corporate HR pay raise and job location policies.
good,The culture here is very diverse. I learned a lot about the credit and debit card industry. Hardest part about the job is the mad customers calling in and yelling at you. Best part is the work culture.
good,"It was a rollercoaster working with First Data. You get the opportunity to work with alot of great people, just to volatile being a 100% commission job"
good,"Take what you can from this employer - the training, the opportunity to work hard and grow - and you can set a foundation that will last the rest of your life."

good,It's definitely not for everyone . Dealing with very angry merchants can be hard but trying to control how much time you spend on the call is hardest.
good,"I worked at First Data for over 20+ years and enjoyed the experience.  The company has moved in a very positive and competitive direction as the market changed.  The work life balance was extremely helpful raising a family.  Competitive environment, opportunity for advancement, and great benefits."

good,"A typical day at work, was managing a team of five HR professional and aligning the Human Resources Department goals with the business objectives.  A very fast past environment with recruitment efforts of 20-30 employees, upon the signing of a financial client, inclusive of on-boarding the new hires immediately for the start of a financial campaign, typically within a timeline of two weeks. I gain a wealth of knowledge in Human Resources from entry-level to senior management level.  Our Human Resources team was in unity and a very family oriented environment.  The hardest part of the job was work and life balance, long work hours to meet the needs of the clients, but our HR team was always supportive in completing deadlines and tasks.  The most enjoyable part of the job, was gaining life long friends for well over 10 years."
good,"My typical work day was hectic, most days I did not even have the time to sit my bag down and set my laptop up. I learned to work in a high stressed environment. The worse part of my day was writing individuals up. I am a people advocate and my first instinct is to help however I had to follow company policy."

good,"Supportive of its employees, provides continuous training to equip employees to function in different roles successfully. Incentives provided encourage employee to be more successful."
good,"Responsible with assisting customers in settling accounts in a call center setting. The hardest part of the job is making sure you reach the monthly budget. The enjoyable part of job is socializing with different people and able to assist those wanting to settle. Management is a non micro-managing style so it encourages leadership skills, personal growth, and critical thinking."
good,First Data is actually a very innovative company always looking for an edge. They often promote from within. The employees are more like family. I have a lot of great relationship from this company and would recommend the company for a peer.
good,"When I worked for First Data it was a great place to work. The benefits were very generous, stock purchase plan, good 401 k plan. The building in Marlborough was State of the art 10 years ago. A lot of the jobs are dependent on contracts with other companies."
good,"I've been at FDC for 3 years and have learned a ton.  For an individual looking for a challenge that will accelerate their career, FDC is the place for you.

There was not much to complain about, there was just a couple departments that closed down which would send people in a scare-uproar but overall this is a great company to work for."
good,"This overall is a pretty good company to work for. If you apply yourself, and work hard you can advance your career. In just four years I went from making boxes to working in the office talking to the banks and editing orders."
good,"I am ready for a change in jobs, I am not feeling that I am being made to feel that I am a valuable asset to the company.  I go above and beyond in my day to day, however am overlooked by management."
good,The pay was great but the stress level was high because of demand of production. The industry crashed weeks after the election of Bush 43. Many lost almost everything with the banks selling or liquidating assets.
good,Capgemini has given me opportunity to learn and grow.  I want to explore it widely.  Also the work environment is good.  Management is not so kind on appreciating the associates.
good,The company was great to work for and my co-workers were the best. The job was challenging at times but I enjoyed my time at First Data.

good,overall good place to work at alot of room to grow managment wise if that what you want. best thing is the people you work with
good,I loved dealing with customer's on a daily basis. I learned daily how to  process credit and debit cards as our process was constantly changing. The benefits were excellent. The hardest part of my job was the gossip. You had to ignore it and be mature enough to continue doing your job.
good,Communication loved helping customers with their questions they hadn't and being bilingual was excellent
good,The work environment was good due to the small work groups in which you were able to interact with your co-workers.
good,"Typical day is quality inspection of testing artefacts produced by offshore testing team including Test Scope, Test Script and Test Completion Report.  Attending daily calls to appraise stakeholders of execution status and resolving defects on QC.  Estimation of new requirements which includes reviewing Business and Functional specifications - estimation is the hardest part of the job and is reliant on use of detailed TCP analysis as well as gaining business knowledge overnight.  "
good,I had a lot of great training here. I sold merchant accounts to business owners. Had to make a lot of outbound calls.
good,I work with and install new clients almost everyday of the workweek. 9 to 10 hours are worked most of the time. There is only 2 people on my team. The hardest part of the job is that it is very demanding. I am on call 24x7x365 except when I am on vacation. The hardest part of the job is finding the time to get everything done. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with in other departments.
good,In the PACT department (projects and conversions team) we call out to locations that are using the credit card terminals that are programmed with bank of america and reprogram them to the First Data platform for the conversion and merge between the two companies. Our job at this time has no opportunity for advancement and will be closing down sooner than later. I love the associates i work with daily and my peers really make it a great place to work.
good,Great company to work for if you can change with every management restructure and adapt to the ever changing priorities.
good,"Overall a good company to work for, excellent benefits and generous paid time off. Job security in management or salary positions can be lacking but hourly positions are pretty secure."
good,"I enjoyed learning how to use the vi editor and writing UNIX scripts to create automated regression tests. "

It was important to me to work my cases in order that would keep me current on cases in a timely manner responding to the most time sensitive ones. I would make calls reply to phone messages and when caught up would extend an offer to help co-workers with some aspects of their case loads. The most difficult part was attempting to explain provisional credit to clients who were unfamiliar with banking processes and requirements. And similarly being able to satisfactory feeling accomplishment for having done so. I was privileged to have great managers who were willing to assist and make every recommendation for improvements to the system of processes we used daily that at many times were greyed. I learned how to think outside of the box as every case worked provided its own personal element of required knowledge to be able to work effectively."

good,"First data was close to my dream job. I got to resolve customer issues, work with programming terminals and change the way some customers had thought about big corporations by relating to them on a personal level about issues. I would still be working there today if not for complications in my health."
good,typical day at work would be handling merchants calls about there accounts. I learned how to deal with angry merchants. my manager was great helpful and understanding. my co workers were friendly and helpful. worst part of my job was angry people who would not listen and didnt care that i was trying to help them. best part of the job was helping people who left happy.

They offer entry-level professional positions, mostly in the call center environments, assisting merchants with equipment and billing questions. There is endless opportunity for advancement for committed individuals who wish to advance."
good,Great company to work for. Very generous. Great management but very high stress for a beginner like me. I was a business consultant. I do miss the training events and rally days. It was great while it lasted. Thank you for the experience First Data.
good,Still have the old school values if you work in EFTPS. Managers are good and have there employee's needs. But upper management does not like people working from home.
good,Networking is key with FD due to the size of the company but there are plenty of opportunities for mentorship. Growth depends on your personal performance ....
good,"The job isn’t too over complicated, after two weeks you are pretty much a pro. Only thing is you don’t have too many days off. Mandatory 7 days at any job is rough on the body."
good,the dept I worked in was relaxed stats were easy to meet.  the company offered good benfits  and flexible  shifts.  I was a lvl 2 fraud analyst when I left the company  the job functions were tedious but they made up for that with the breaks and lunch  my manager was a really easy going guy helpful.  I only left  due to my physical health taking a spiral at the time
good,"As an innovation-driven and customer-focused company, First Data provides a broad and integrated portfolio of services; I personally think they have great benefits. I know they cover a good portion of the various insurances."
good,It's all about what you make of it. I have enjoyed every position that I have had here. I've learned from everyone that I have encountered. Do your work to the best of your ability and be eager to learn and you will go far within the company.
good,"save your money manage your time. great place to start working and career wise , unlimited overtime , overtime comes  in handy when an emergency comes up"
good,"Typically very busy work environment, on most days due to new rules being introduced and changes made to the policies. I learned to multitask efficiently, while being encouraged by management and other colleagues, who were always positive and had a can-do attitude."
good,"Upper management too disconnected from the trenches. Overwhelming do more with less culture under our newest management."
good,This job was fun for the most part. Good incentives. The only reason I even resigned from the job was because they moved far away from where I lived. When I first got there the hours were perfect. They ended up changing that also.
good,Customer were sometimes stressed do to sales representative were less than informative.  Pay could be better considering we dealt with upset customers who would curse at you sometimes.
good,"the job duties are standard to any business development or sales position"
good,"I supervised 15-25 collectors on a daily basis. Although I have my team to support, I also supervised and assisted other teams. My responsibilities were assisting collectors with escalated customer calls, payment errors, system issues and account look-ups. I supported my team and other team members by showing encouragement,motivation and availability when needed. My goal was  to lead a team with great knowledge of the business and to produce great productivity for the company."
good,"I enjoyed working at First Data, but a new CEO was hired who took away many of the benefits that were used in my decision to join First Data originally.  After they took away 2 of our personal days without directly telling employees, I decided to leave for greener pastures.  Straw that broke this camel's back."
good,"•Placing inbound/outbound calls to merchant, ISO and bank sales representative to build files downloads and/or complete training.Provide advanced tech"
good,"The work environment is decent. I worked in the call center portion. You come in, sit at you computer, log on to your phone and take calls as they come, and accurately noting how you help. Follow procedures and you should do well. I've work the Point Of Sales help Desk and was an Account Specialist for WFMS. Point Of Sales is fine but clearly undermanned as they have a need for mandatory overtime. WFMS is a little more easy going, some days are slow, some are busy. No tech support in the Account Specialist desk but you help manage the accounts."
good,"The work environment is positive with an engaged management team. There are few opportunities for advancement, but a new program has been launched to attempt to change that part of the culture."
good,Productive place to work with people that make time fly and entertaining.It has work that ranges from easy to ones that challenge the mind. Plenty of locations with different varieties of work. Many chances to move through and up in the company.
good,"This was my first job right out of high school. It has excellent business infrastructure and guidelines, I learned real world experience on how to conduct business and speak to clients. During my tenure I was groomed as I advanced for positions and the knowledge and experience gained has helped me propel myself forward in life."
good,"Would recommend this company to a friend or family member. I enjoyed working here the benefits were good. They paid for my degree, and I am grateful for that."
good,Promotions were available within the company.  Training for different areas was also available.  Enjoyed the type of work available by building business relationships with customers and teams
good,"A typical day at work consists of cold calling and door to door sales. Leads were all self-sourced by building referral relationships with businesses with access to a wide range of smaller businesses. Such as; web development, wholesale, and medical businesses. "
good,I will miss FDC. We were like family. I will miss the celebrations and team motivation activities.They were always very competitive.  Also our department was very collaborative and inspiring.
good,It was a good place to work at. I wouldn't work there again if it were me. There are always a lot of changes to keep up with. Managment was alright did just enough
good,"Stayed until work was finished, so some days could be extremely long.  Left and came back, would do it again if job security was better. "
good,"been working at first data for just under a year and have learnt so much, met some lovely people and my current manager has been very helpful and supportive, had a hard start with my first manager taking ill and being off for a long term sickness but have definatly benefited working for this company. I was working part time evening shifts between 4-8pm to fit around my college commitments and after completing my college course I was able to change my shifts to the morning so I finished at a reasonable time to be able to complete other things throughout the day. My day would consist of working for 3hrs 50 minutes on the phone speaking to customers who have fallen into arrears, I learnt how easy it is for some people to struggle financially and how important it is to be honest and ask for help if you need it. The most challenging part of my job was dealing with people who were considered 'vulnerable' and trying to find the best option for them without causing any further stress due to their financial situations however it is good to know that you have helped somebody to your best ability."
good,"Generalnie praca bardzo ok, zarobki, pakiety socjalne itd. Minus - niestety korpo i to niestety proces narastający."
good,"The job culture was very positive.  Team members had been there for so long they knew how to do their jobs, but someone new would have to go looking for documented processes."
good,good place to work in if you could find a manager that's willing to manage you as you should be managed and treat you the same as all employees. I've witnessed too much favoritism.
good,"A typical day consists of getting your documentations up and ready to receive calls and assist merchants to the best of your capability whether it was troubleshooting their device and escalating cases if the troubleshooting tactics on my behalf as a technical specialist were not successful, or if it was answering questions regarding their funding and statements and app market billing. We too ensured to direct the merchants and sales reps to the correct department to get their needs resolved."
good,Very good benefits. You will be recognized for hard work and dedication to the company. Hard work and a stressful environment will keep you on edge at times. Management could be a lot better and are very inconsistent in policy and procedures.Employees are great but a lot of turnover due to management.
good,"I've worked at first days for about ten years and it was overall a great experience. Besides a couple of not the greatest supervisors, it was an easy run. Great benefits, easy work, environment really chill and fun sometimes"
good,"Working environment is very relaxed. Deadlines are to be met, but there aren't stressful to achieve. Management is very helpful and willing to teach employees new skills."
good,"Overall a great place to work, if you can deal with some not so great managers. There is the ability, if ambitious, to move up quite fast and make decent pay. However, be careful, as you get closer to the middle management positions you also move closer to being part of their annual ""company restructuring""."
good,Great company to work with and work for.This work environment is great for growth. great place to build. The department I work with is very productive .
good,Great employees and supervisors and managers. Very busy place of work. If you like fast place environments. Repetitive work. Great people to work with.
good,Worked with the International Agent Banks in the Latin American Region.  Leadership allowed me to make a difference and employ my skillset in a very positive way.
good,Worked at remote office for over 18 yrs that closed in 2016. Co-workers were great to work with; everyone was helpful. After so many years it felt like a second family. Miss going there!
good,"At one time First Data Corporation was a great company to work for. Things do change. There were team building events, once a month or every other month free lunches. I enjoyed working with my coworkers, you really didn't have a supervisor breathing on you as long as you did your job."
good,"No work from Home days and you must dress business casual. "
good,"balance life, good shift times, transport service. Growth opportunities are very slow. . HR policy are OK. seems company is still under improvement  ...."
good,"Had a good resource program.  Took a long time to get issues fixed for customers unless you learned quickly who to contact.  Manager was never available after 4:30 in afternoon, which is when many issues would start to arise.  Was able to customize rates for customers depending on business verticle but was taken away and mandated higher rates above competition."
good,"good company to work for, good insurance, stock options, career options, provides educational and training to advance career opportunities. I loved working for First Data and would recommend to anyone."
good,Good company to work for and many challenges to keep you striving for excellence.  Great company to work with no matter if you are looking to go it on your own or to have a large company to drive you to excellence.
good,First data isn't a bad company to work for. The benefits could be better. The supervisors a very personable with you and understanding.  Sometimes the company can make you feel overwhelmed or pressured. When I started working for the company I felt as if first data would be the company I will retire from.  With all the changes I'm not sure about that now. It's not the best company I work for but is not the worst either.
good,"Great overall company to work for. They value their reps in the field."
good,Run a mail machine to get product out in a timely manner.  The faster you worked the more you advanced.  Fixing the machine was a challenge sometimes.
good,Here I started as a customer service rep.  I then moved to terminal tech.  I helped consumers repair credit card terminals.  This is a very complacent work environment.  You are in a cubicle all day.
good,although the company has a history of layoffs each year it is a well structured and strong company with many advancement oppurtunities.
good,"Great for entry level. Not suited for long term. Doesn't pay nearly what employees deserve.Great support systems for employees such as clubs and groups for different backgrounds. Very open, tolerant, accommodating, and accepting of LGBTQ community and different races and religions. Great place to start and get experience, but low pay rates lead to high attrition rates."
good,"First Data is not a bad place to work as a whole. They offer good benefit choices, mostly competitive pay, and have many employment opportunities. However, their new action plan system is unforgiving and relentless. If you have the misfortune of getting on one, prepare to be fighting to get off of it for at minimum 180 days (but most likely much longer)."
good,"It was a fast paced job, quickly looking up phone numbers for customers on a headset. I enjoyed working with both fellow employees and supervisors. Hours were a bit changeable, as the company needed."
good,"Typical day work, very busy the day goes by quicker than you can get work done in.  I have learned quite a bit, manage time, work with merchants in many different phases of anger.  "
good,"The hardest part of working with Merchant Services is the challenge about balance work and home. Being a merchant rep, it's hard to balance your personal life because many client prefer you over customer service. With that being said, it was really different to make a balance due to needy/clingy clients."
good,I liked working at First Data and enjoyed my experience. If I move back to the Hagerstown area I would try and seek employment there again.
good,This is a very fast paced busy working environment and I really enjoy that about this office. There are rarely any slow days and if there is our bosses always find a way.
good,made over 100 calls a day out bound try to get costumers over to out company and sell equipment to them to get them emv ready
good,"Great company - wonderful coworkers,  Nature of the job could be stressful - as technical issues can be.  There was exposure to Mainframe, which  I had not worked with for over 15 years.  We had a great team in which everyone got along.  People were willing to share their expertise.  The hardest part of the job was working graveyard shift - (which I enjoyed)."
good,First Data is a OK place to work.  Sometimes they try to make the job and the place fun. First Data is a clean place to work.  The people and the supervisers are nice there.
good,"Working at First Data, I learned that team work is essential. On a daily basis we work as a team to identify issues, an escalate them in a timely manner. It is a very high paced environment where I became an expert at multitasking. Escalating an issue means updating opened ticket, contacting engineers, and updating manager and co-workers all the same time. I became versatile to the highest level there is."
good,First data is a good place to work but I will say the benefits and career advancement potential are not like they used to be
good,Resolving all customer issues in a timely manner while under pressure of deadlines. Learned to work effectively as a team as well as independently. Enjoyable part of the job is satisfy customers needs and resolving their issues.
good,Good company to work for with lots of job opportunities and good working environment. Company offers good benefits but needs to offer better compensation.
good,"Great place to work for once called Cardservice International, will take lots of great memories with me.  Met lots of great people throughout the years, learned a lot from the various Dpts I worked in.  Office work was very stressful at times dealing with Incoming calls, email and faxes on a daily basis but got through each day with the support of great colleagues and management."
good,"not a bad place to work, but something I have mixed feelings about. I don't hate it, but it's not really in a great region, and the possibility of significant advancement is mixed. I like the people there, I just don't know that I can make a career out of it."
good,"My typical day involved taking calls from independant sales reps and businesses. We would help create programming using premade software files and download them into machines. We also assisted with calls about how to process transactions and technical issues concerning connection issues and programming. "
good,"I would get into work i would log in then i would review my workload for the day. Then I would continue with highest priority of request as well as accepting instant messages questions/requests. At 9:30 am my team meets every morning followed by other meetings with Senior Vice Presidents, Vice Presidents, Directors. I have learned so many diffirent things at FirstData some good some bad in overall the company is a wonderful place to work."
good,First Data is a great company to work for. I like the fact that the people I work with are all like family. I love the work culture.
good,Stayed with Company for many years through many changes. Unfortunately many changes included job relocations which i could not do again.
good,"Worked at this company over 5 years and it was a great learning experience. It is a fun place to work, however there are lots of hoops to jump through in order to climb the corporate ladder."
good,This place provides Chance for employees advancement but managers and leaders are rude. Compensation is great and you have the opportunity to work in a multicultural environment
good,"No typical day."
good,work life balance limited advancement going through a revolutionary change since the new CEO
good,"Data Entry updating address for current merchants"
good,"Pleasant work environment, overcame many obstacles regarding case management. Loved the experience"

good,"My typical day involves"
good,"While Working At First Data I had been able to Learn alot of things dealing with Computers and other machines, as well as working in a team."
good,"A typical day at FDR begins with a good dose of administrative work. Payroll, attendance records, follow up on coaching from previous day... That's the first hour. The next few hours are working with direct reports to help them improve their skills. Coaching where needed and building good rapport with my team. There are plenty of projects to go around. You may be working on a project to boost VOC or to track how many times an agent gets asked a specific question on their calls.whatever it is, it will break up the regular 'hum-drum' office type day. The last couple hours are spent in meetings. There is never a dull moment and you have to squeeze a lot of activity into 1-8 hour day.It's pretty well rounded though."
good,"Great Co-workers!  Great Job Work/Life Balance!"
good,"What have you done for me lately? That is the way the comany works. Fantastic people, wonderful customers. No loyalty, sadly."
good,"The upper management strive to ensure a good work moral for the general employee; however lack of effort on the side of lower management does not always allow the average employee to benefit."
good,"   I arrive a few minutes early to get signed in, so I can be available to receive calls at my designated start time.  I have learned a few things related to banking, and the way credit card processing works.  I can approach anyone in management with any questions I might have. My co-workers are all very friendly and good at their jobs.The hardest part of my is trying to find some of the answers to the questions Merchants ask. We have a 'go to' folder where we can go to look up proper procedures, answers to rarely asked question.Sometimes, they are hard to find, or they are just not there, and it can be very frustrating when you want to give Merchants the correct information, but you cant find the answers yourself.  I enjoy my co-workers the most, call centers always have such diverse groups of employees, which helps to make it interesting. "
good,"I really liked this job, What we had to do was type in several different checks into computer programs. The payee line was typed as one focus and then the dates would be typed. I love to type and pay attention to details. We were allowed to listen to headphones while we typed away. That made the day go smoothly. It was sort of an independent job, but ultimately we worked as a team to get all the checks processed properly!"
good,"I obtained a great deal of experience working for First Data. My management team and co-workers were all professional and hard working. Our team was like a family, as we all worked together to ensure projects and conversions were completed on time and accurately. "
good,"	Investigate 60-100 Money Order, Money Transfer and Collection Accounts on a daily basis to insure that the agents are not in violation of the Western Union Contract, also to prevent Western Union taking any Financial Loss. "
good,A great company for right out of college. Great stepping stone and learning tool
good,"Typical day at work is coming in and helping the merchants with their POS systems,"
good,"Very fast pace environment, challenging organization, opportunity for advancement."
good,"The work was challenging, great coworkers, awesome boss. The stress level was not bad. The big issue is that the work keeps getting outsourced and employees lose their jobs."
good,"The company was great, i would recommend employment with them. Considerate to their employees"
good,I am a very timely person and willing to learn every aspect of any job that is given to perform. I get alone with all employees regardless of how they feel and try to engage in a learning process to ordain the company more revenues and business.
good,Good! I am satisfied.
good,Benefits were great. Management very understanding of work/life balance.
good,First data is a very productive work place. Traning is always available to advance your career.

good,"Environment is fast pace and demanding, however compensation is above average and more than fair. You will learn much about the credit card business and this knowledge opens many doors.Try to learn about all areas of the business do not limit yourself. The more you know about the business the more valuable you are."
good,"Honestly I have really enjoyed working here. The people are great! After almost a decade answering phone, I'm over it. Not the place but job style in general"
good,"I worked at First Data Full time for  9 years. I've learned a lot!  unfortunately, I got laid off. Grate company to work for and great benefits. Team leaders were very helpful t when you need help. They work around my school schedules! Some of my managers were awesome to work with except the last one. The workload was heavy with deadlines . The deadlines were reachable. Co-workers were wonderful."
good,Benefits and pay is very competitive. Must be a self starter and ready to learn more through your own actions. Collections is a very dynamic environment.
good,Work is complex but generally most people supported where needed. reason for leaving is contract expiration. Desk space is a premium and limited space available but option to work from home is good.
good,I was there as a temporary employee and was treated with respect.  I was included in department outings.  It was a relaxed and caring environment. I would have liked to stay but I was placed at another position.
good,"We was go in file room and there fined files this was typical day."
good,good place to work but needs more duty variety. people being nasty all  day gets old quick. promotion needs to be available in 6 months not a year. More praise needs to be given.
good,"very busy facility.low pay , great work place to begin. contanatly busy,great working friendships.processesing order for pulling and preparing shipping documents."
good,"You get out of it what you put in it,  competitive, Fast-paced, Management will work with you on issues, good company to grow with. I will recommend this job."
good,"If first data came back to corpus christi I think I would reapply ,good work enviroment and stableness .Can be a bit stressful do to grading systems to follow  but all jobs can be some what stressful to follow"
good,"Workplace is very good infrastructure wise."
good,"Arrived at a bad moment (IPO) so wasn't chosen to stay, no one['s fault."
good,"Overall good company to work, provides work life balance but can do better in terms of employees career pathing and advancement. Need to also work on compensation and benefits factors as per current industry trend and market."
good,"The work environment is so good. Best client to work with, I Enjoyed working for First data commercial services . Very good people and culture is amazing,"
good,"Typical day starts with assessing new/current opportunities in pipeline and providing updates in Salesforce.  Reaching out to clients and touching base with contacts to grow the relationship.  Working with internal teams (i.e. finance, product, Sr. Mgt., etc) to proceed with contract renewals and product sales. Great team environment, fun atmosphere and peer/mgt support.  The hardest part of the job was the work/life balance due to high travel schedule but manageable. Great camaraderie and team environment."
good,"Mi Valoración para este trabajo es la siguiente: Firstdata (Posnet) es un empresa Gigante y la representación en la que trabaje yo, fuimos muy pocos para tantas tareas diarias, Atendes el teléfono sin parar, la gente entra sin parar para arreglar su ""equipo POS"", consultas por nuevos Adquirentes/Ventas y el trabajo diario de Repartir los equipos nuevos y suministros en la calle. Entonces... creo que fue un trabajo muy sacrificado física y mentalmente pero en el que realmente se aprende MUCHÍSIMO. Me dio muchísima experiencia para encarar lo que sea que este por venir con muchas ganas."
good,Needed more billingual agents. Some people where amazing. Trainers were great and leads were aswell. Managers were MIA most of the time. Calls would get stressfull at times
good,"Report to work station and begin your responsibilities with attention detail to provide quality service. Reasonable breaks, likable friendly people. My direct manager was hard working and attentive to worker needs and concerns."
good,"It would have been a great place to grow and advance forward, but I had to relocate. It was a good environment but management could have used a few classes on manners. I can recommend people to work there if they have patience."
good,"Great and intelligent people to work with in a striving Fintech industry.  Enjoyed the atmosphere, technology.  The compensation was average.  My commute was terrible."
good,"Fast pace environment with multiple customers and products supported. Excellent management, good benefits, good people, fair review process of performance"
good,First Data is a good place to get your foot in the door for corporate life. I made good friends and contact for future career advancements. There is room to grow but it is also easy to have your whole department shutdown and sent oversees.
good,"First Data offered a rewarding opportunity to work with vendors and clients.  "
good,"While employed there I had no real complaints.  The benefit package was awesome.  Insurance coverage was great. Vacation time was great,.  The servance package was supposed to be great too but most of the things we were told in our severance package was untrue."
good,"First Data is a good place to work for.  Prior to this position I was in operation in a office all day long so there was some necessary adjustments.  There was even a time (9 months into this job) where I considered quitting because of how complex this industry can be.  10 Plus years later I’m happy I didn’t.  This job has allowed me the following"
good,Has been a great place to work which has allowed me to advance over the years. By starting in Customer Service I gained the base knowledge that enabled me to excel.
good,"Your success and happiness will depend upon the position and department you join. I was blindsided when I joined the company and eventually figured out I was part of a pilot team which was the source of many of my frustrations. However, it did provide me with the opportunity to learn many systems and aspects of the industry."
good,"It was a very chill atmosphere to work in. Dress code was regular clothes and they provided you smocks to wear overtop. Everyone was fun to be around but the work was very fast paced. You are dealing with working with producing people credit and debit cards so it is very secure. Cameras are rolling at all times. There are multiple jobs however in  PRODUCTION  there are either four things you can do. "
good,"Great team environment. Everyone knew everyone. Merger resulted in several layoffs. Became an ""old boys club"" after the merger where several Chase employees replaced First Data employees."
good,First Data downsized and moved out of Tx. Everyday was a joy to be at work with the people and staff which made coming to work a wonderful experience. The best thing about working there were the way the company was run from the top down with the spotlight on appreciation for the employees. They looked out for the safety of the employees as well as their personal concerns. The experience of working for a big corporation which cared for its employees has not been felt since we all left First Data. Many of my co-workers have express sorrow of the leaving of First Data from the area and hoped it will someday return.
good,"Great work place. Learned a lot from management.  The wealth of knowledge some of the leaders have is astounding.  Learned a lot of information.  Located in Atlanta, ga"
good,"FirstData USA provided a solid foundation to helpdesk and customer service applications in the financial industry. Internal hiring allowed for excellent mobility, but led to not-my-department mentality that would cause customers stress when trying to resolve multiple problems."
good,"My job requires patience, active listening, use of word, excel lync, and customer quality skills. I usually arrive 5 to 10 minutes before my shift start.The workplace is friendly. The first thing I do is to check my email for recent updates or new information that are needed to do my job.. The hardest part of my job is listening to a client using profanity language against you while assisting him to solve the issues at hand. The most enjoyable part of my job is receiving appreciation from clients."
good,"Excellent company , and though they are closing their Houston offices , still fairly rate them high for companies to work for. My living situation did not accommodate a relocation, and pay was too minimal to consider for my position."
good,FD is a productive and inclusive work environment. Each day new challanges are brought forward. We are usually given the freedom to approach the role they way we see fit
good,most people have been there for a long time mostly because of the culture of the company and how relaxed the workload is. Most people retire in this place. They are lenient with schedules. Work is specially great for new parents.
good,Nice place to work and good work life balance.  The work depends on the team you are put in. Most of the Team and managers are very good. I enjoy working here.
good,In my time there I learned a lot about several systems I had no knowledge on prior. Advanced my position within a year and was very satisfied after doing so.
good,First Data is a leader in payments and I enjoyed the three years I worked there.  As a Business Consultant I worked with Bank Clients to identify needs and help them into a processing solution to fit their business.  Hours were long and bank relationships required constant attention to remain productive.  Good work life balance and great CEO. Stock option came after IPO and company has an inclusive culture.
good,Worked several nights while going to college part time. Very good place to make $$$ and keeping your dress pant and dress shirt on all the time. Very comfortable air conditioned halls full of international workers speaking hundreds of languages. You worked 2 hours without blinking and took 15 minutes break and worked another 2 hours and took and hour break. Repeated the process until 8 hours passed and went home happy.
good,First Data has gone through a transition where it's current emphasis is on becoming a leader in technological solutions.  They are not hesitant about going outside their own walls to find solutions that would benefit their clients.  The environment is friendly and conducive to enabling individuals to grow and thrive.  They offer their employees a good amount of autonomy which I personally used to develop and administer training sessions geared toward business analysis and personal development.
good,"My typical day is 7 hours on customer service phone lines. Occasionally back to back cals but that may be one day a week. "
good,The company is a good company to get your feet wet in the corporate world.The responsibilities and duties section is the most important part of the job description.
good,professional company. worked with Government solutions as consultant. Very good higher management. Company pays well in govt solutions contracts and project Management Offices.
good,"Great Management, but salary and benefits could be better. Good growth opportunities. I have to switch jobs, because management has decided to shut down current location."
good,"In both teams I've worked in there has always been a friendly and helpful atmosphere.  Training is good and used as an induction into most departments.  The workplace culture is that of a call center as Underwriting is located alongside - good timekeeping is therefore vital as calls need to be covered and tardiness is frowned upon.  Hardest part of the job is meeting client based deadlines when queues are abnormally high.  The most enjoyable part of the job has to be the people, they are great, we all spend time sociably together which  I think says a lot."
good,"The company provided opportunities to advance and improve technical knowledge. For me, it was rewarding to work with innovative people and learn new software skills."
good,"days consist of answering phones and assiting merchant with their fee's, transactions adjustments, terminal support, it is a fast past enviroment, but overall a good company"
good,I enjoy the challenges offered working for a corporations this size. The work in my department is very challenging and difficult to learn but I have the support from management to help me grow into this industry
good,"My role was a clear and smooth one with a critical manager. I was coordinating between QA and other teams for defect coordination. Wrote daily update status report and weekly status , attended required meeting. after the reviewing and updating approved the test cases and consolidated the defects."
good,Haven't worked here in several years but when I was there pay was great. Insurance was good. My coworkers were awesome. This is a very demanding place to work as monditor over time happes a lot.
good,"I value the time I have worked for First Data. They compensate their employees fairly and treat people with respect. I have a lot of autonomy on the job as I have proven to be trustworthy and dedicated to to my job and employer. The only complaint I have is the limited professional growth I am to achieve working here. There is very little room to grow at a reasonable pace if you are a mid-level employee, there is no tier directly above you on the hierarchy.

good,We were always changing to improve efficiency. Consolidated many areas from other cities to Omaha. Our Department originated in Omaha. Changed our platforms several times to keep up with technology. Immediate supervisors very helpful and encouraging. The support teams worked well together to troubleshoot and resolve issues. It was difficult sometimes to get some departments to play together. The best part was of course the people you worked with and when you finally resolved that unsolvable issue.
good,"My work hours are from 8:00am to 5:00pm. Normally I  come in everyday day at 7:30am get logged in to my laptop, and get ready for 8:00am.

My 43 account executives were split up in 2 teams. I had some out of Kansas, Missouri, Texas and Oklahoma. The end of the month was the most challenged and stressful time. Everyone would submit deals to get there numbers for the end of the month, which also include other issues.

good,The diverse cultures within the company allowed for lively discussions and varied points of view which helped on projects and initiatives.
good,If you manage to stay away from the logoffs you might have a chance to survive in this company. Due to so many turnover in the upper management this company continues to make left turns.
good,"First Data is very client-focused and demands a high-standard of professionalism for all employees.  In 2013, management adapted an employee-owned strategy, but it is not well-received by employees.  The company reduced the number of personal vacation days and benefits.  Employees now have ""shares"" of the profits, though vestiture depends on tenure and company profitability.  Management at the VP level and below was excellent, I thought, and company invested heavily in training its management.  In 2013 and 2014 the company downsized considerably in it's Omaha location."

I provide them with the steps needed to preform the download that is required by all Wells Fargo Merchants in order for them to accept the requested credit card types. Together we preform test transaction with test card numbers that I provide them as in incorporate the nessary training they may need to use the terminal. If at any point there is an issue with the download or the test transactions we preform the necessary troubleshooting steps to correct the issue. I thank them for being a Wells Fargo merchant and make sure they have all the phone numbers they may need to get assistance at any time.

good,I worked at First Data for over 8 years. My job was to find and sell credit card processing. It was a hunter position and I was very successful. You do not last over 8 years if you have not had success.
good,Typically in a day I would sit in a cubicle around others who are normally very inviting and great people. I would take calls between set hours from merchants (business owners) to ask questions about their account and transactions they received. I learned that there is more to businesses and how they work and how to work as an individual but at the same time a team. Hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers but the most enjoyable part was when they accepted your help and were very happy.

good,"I have always enjoyed my time here. There are good opportunities to advance and you are recognized for your contributions. Working with management and clients on a daily basis to resolve any issues that arise, and to proactively monitor potential roadblocks keeps the job enjoyable. Management has always been supportive as well as receptive to any feedback. The hardest part of the job would be that sometimes meetings can get a little tedious. The most enjoyable part has been working with great people that have come through the system."
good,"If you’re looking for a company with great benefits, this is the job for you. The company treats you like family. The managers are warm hearted and always willing to help."
good,"As a Customer Service person in the Fraud Detection area, we came in early enough to grab a headset and wait for an open cubicle and plug-in as the beginning of shift begins. For the first six months we were in training and taking inbound calls. The next phase we trained for inbound and outbound calls. Fraud Detection, for banks subscribing to First Data, is interacting with card-holders when suspicious transactions are flagged for either confirmation or denial. If the customer indicates that the transaction is his/hers, we thank them for their time and close the call. If the customer indicates that the transaction is not theirs or fraudulent, we close their card and direct them to obtain a new card from their bank. The second phase of this position became more complicated. We handled incoming and outgoing calls concerning fraudulent charges where we viewed their actual acct. activity for similar transactions which meant they were not fraudulent.Sometimes we called their bank. All of this is tracked. They rated us by calls per hour, attendance, and etc. People are generally friendly and helpful."
good,"They have very high quality standards for their vendors. You are trained very well and have plenty of assistance, if needed. Shift times vary to fit your need or you can shift swap if needed. Bring your own food, the cafeteria is very overpriced."

good,"A typical day at work was busy. Alot of phone calls and customer service. I learned some basic sales skills working for First Data, also how processing accounts worked.

good,A typical work day would be showing up to work in the morning and having a coffee with my co-workers before we start working. Its an amazing work environment full of amazing people. I would have to say that the hardest part of the job would have to be handling all the secretaries and the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to see all the amazing people I worked with.
good,"Good environment and compensation. Good leadership and opportunity for advancement."
good,A typical day within the company consisted of calling old/new leads of merchant's who never answer the phone nor do they call back majority of the time.  I have learned from working the thousands of accounts that we manage that most of the merchant's were mislead by someone at some point.  My manager within this company knew a lot of stuff as far as rules and guidelines but as far as my role both were clueless to even know what it is directly that we do.  My coworkers are all awesome we make the best of the situation and get along well.  We always have positive feedback for each other after from monitoring a call to training each other on new campaigns.  There really was no hard part about the job at all.  The most enjoyable part of the job was having the motivation from your peers once you have gotten an angry/outrage merchant they are there to cheer you up because you have done all that you could do to help the situation.
good,The company has great benefits and I worked for a great team of management people.  Company always growing.  I had a great boss last couple years I was in the company but I had to move out of the country so I quit the job.

Went through certain procedures to verify the legitimacy of account users. If everything was to the good, the transaction proceeded. If something wrong, explained to the appropriate individual on how to proceed. Good atmosphere and co-workers. A reasonable opportunity for advancement. Politics were limited below management level."

good,There was no place for me to advance. I was at the top position of Sr. Admin Assistant.
good,I did a variety of jobs for this company.  I enjoyed working at the fast pace of this company.  I was the office assistant and there was never a dull day.
good,"I was with the company for 9.5 years. In that time there was never a dull moment when I went to work. My co-workers were always incredible individuals from all different walks of life, who were easy to approach with questions or issues, should you need their help. The management team was excellent as it provided guidance for successful career building and long term advancement in the company. I learned many things during my time there, but the greatest thing is the importance of communication, especially when it concerns customers. Everyone learns and understands differently, failure to recognize this can cause negative experiences. The most difficult part of the job at times was the prioritizing of items given to complete, a report, a review, etc. When so many individuals are dependent on you, trying to complete the work and satisfy your coworkers within their time frame can sometimes be difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job, was the ability to learn something new everyday. There always seemed to be something new that I would encounter during my time there."
good,"As a director of product management, I loved the new and exciting opportunities that were presented to me on a daily basis.  A lot of these new opportunities were somewhat challenging, which is what I enjoyed most about my job.  I also enjoyed getting to know my co-workers over the last 20 years.

good,"I loved working for First Data. They supported me and took care of my customers. They offer great benefits and good compensation but had higher rates for merchant services. I thought the grass was greener on the other side and would love to rewind time and go back to working with First Data. Unfortunately, they already filled the position and have no openings."
good,"Well to start my typical day of work would be on time at 7:55 cause i start at 8:00 and i start off by a quick over-look at my duty list on my desk. Then begin plugging in names and business deals. Once im dont with that i sort out all types of mail, employment notices, and network locations. I have learned that data entry is more than just data entry what i thought it was. I loved the management, and co-workers there. The hardest part of my job was entry assistant i had to make sure all others was up to pace with notices and names. The most enjoying part was lunch we had 1 hour lunch breaks wen ever you want to take it."

I work in the Canadian department as a customer and Terminal tech support. I learn new systems everyday I search and enter data.

good,"Managed the transition process of portfolio of accounts from Denver to New York and successfully finished the project in one month. Minimize write-offs by investigating reconciliation items and effectively communicating with operations, banks and vendors. Co-workers are all easy going, help each other to finish monthly close. The enjoyable part of the job is working with my team member to solve the problem for our clients."
good,"Even after the change in benefits, the time off and benefits were still very generous. However, the company was constnatly in flux, constantly trying to save money. Entire departments were laid off with startling regularity and it hurt the corporate culture since everyone was always a bit anxious that they may be next. The employees are great and the work-life balance were perfect. In fact, everyone at first data were incredible kind and hard working, however some of the cuts to benefits and staff seemed short sighted."
good,"Lots of bank relations service time which can take away from sales calls if your not really organized. Management really cares about your success! They are not followers in this industry, they are the leaders as their competitors are constantly playing catch up to First Data."
good,I worked graveyard shift here so I worked with 3 other co workers and didn't really have much view on the environment around the place. But I enjoyed the challenge of working through the night.

However, the feeling of resolving the issue so that the new merchant who just opened for business and them thanking you graciously is very rewarding. Co-workers were very helpful. Although I was put in a few situations were there was no help available anywhere and I was forced to solve to issue on my own which made my clients very impatient with me. I learned how to solve problems on my own which may help me in the future. Management, on the other hand, could have been more organized in my opinion. A few situations occurred where our managers did not agree on certain topics which made somethings unclear or they would not approach directly to discuss something they did not approve of. With that being said, First Data was an okay company to work for."

The company is in a transformation process to improve in many areas and there have been many challenges with this process.

My most enjoyable part of the job was working closely with my VP, she was located remotely but helped me learn and soon I became her right hand man.

I was initially interviewed for a collections positions but was then hired as a Supervisor over two teams that needed some serious guidance. The good thing about that was, while teaching others I learned a lot myself. The most difficult thing about the job was working with a lot of employees that lost the desire to excel.
