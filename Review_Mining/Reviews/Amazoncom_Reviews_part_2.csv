rating,review
good,"Managers will constantly be on you even if you are on task."
good,does not seem as though they really did not care for me as a person no lenience what so ever if you have 99.99 percent production regardless it is a write up 3 write ups in 9 months they will fire you
good,It’s all up to you to make it here. Crazy rates to keep up with in some departments. Favorites by managers do get far. Manager rarely know anything for certain. Always has to get back to you. Crazy walks to some break rooms When you work on 4th or 3rd floor!
good,"People who work faster than others are put into positions where they have to work harder than others who just can't do the job in packing and its frustrating when you've met quota and you get placed with people who aren't even trying"
good,management sucks and its about who you know not how hard you work. i wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Another thing is that it is way too over populated.
good,I only work at a delivery station but the overall atmosphere of the warehouse is heavy. A lot of associate drama and managers rarely take associate feedback into consideration.
good,"They like to overwork their employees and they push us to scan at a certain rate so they can cut everyone's work hours, resulting in hardly get paid very well."
good,"I never worked at a place where you were monitored all the time.  We were told at one point it should only take us 6 minutes to sign out of the system and use the restroom!!  It was all about the numbers, and I understand that, but the expectations, in my opinion, were unatainable."
good,"I’ve been working at Amazon for nearly half a year now and so far it’s been alright. Most of the people you come across seem nice and pleasant and the work isn’t too difficult. However, the breaks are far too short and due to the size of the place you’ll be rushing around in the time you want to put your feet up and relax. The agencies are not very understanding either and I’ve been given warnings about absences due to family emergencies and the fact that I sustained an injury to my leg (and 10 hours of putting pressure on it is agony) so beware! Probably not a long term thing for most people"
good,"From the time time you clock in, you will be busy, and any slack or time off task will be subject to negative feedback. Workloads can be incredibly stressful, often performing multiple functions to minimize hours lost in path. Equipment, like forklifts, will often be left in poor or broken condition for long periods of time before being repaired."
good,I would have remained with the company if able to. But due to family issues and concerns I decided to move closer to home. Sorry amazon. Will recommend to others in the future.
good,It's a good job to work while in school but not as easy as they make it seem for advancment.Lower  Management was very sloppy. Turn over rates are horrible because they will bully people into quiting.
good,"not a good place to work if you are getting back on your feet.feed back was never good at all, too many young supervisors they dont have good people skills."
good,Working there is great with the many people there but management was unhealthy lacking the time off work to relax and regain strength for continuous work place
good,"everything comes and goes with your manager. I saw the good, the bad and the ugly."
good,"Long days, but not many days a week so plenty of time to do other things how ever you are exhausted and just sleep most of the first day if you are like me"
good,I was a contractor for Amazon Fresh at graveyard shift. Management was very helpful and supportive. The atmosphere of cultures was vary from high school grads to late 50th yet everyone was collaboratively working together.
good,Hard to maintain a work life balance.  If you do not have a family to take care of and can devote most of your time to your career then this is where you want to be.
good,Working here was like any other job. but i found out as i advanced that it was amazons goal to do the most amount of work with the least amount of people even if it is at the cost of their workers.
good,"Amazon thinks that you are a robot and suppose to constantly do above and beyond for work that a 5th grader can do. Its safe to work, however, the managers suck the fun out of working your job."
good,"It's okay at first, you'll be caught up in how much they pay, and then a couple months go by and so does your sanity, you begin to question if your life is really worth $16 an hour. It's. Not. 10 hour shifts make you feel like you're in an insane asylum, it's just not worth the pain."
good,"The job is stressful enough, then you have to worry about being stepped on/over/through because someone wants the job more than you. It doesn't matter if you have triple the experience, if Joe Schmo knows the right person, he got the job and you didn't. "
good,Its a very competitive and fast paced work place. A standard work day depends on which shift you are on. Night shift is the busiest shift with the highest ship goals.
good,"My days at Amazon were stressful and difficult.  My training was not up to par, and my trainer conducted the training too fast.   This one day training was to get the team put to work as soon as possible.  The system in place lacks, it is designed to work the pickers into exhaustion.  My job was at a pickers station, designed to work the employee, picking merchandise, some weighing over 50 pounds at a very fast rate.  "
good,"Pay was sufficient for job, once you included benefits, without it was underpaid. Not much advancement for people my age. Managers were rotated frequently, which made for some confusion at times. Training not long enough for new hires. which caused high turnover rate."
good,"not the worst job but there is flex up which is mandatory overtime if you haven't hit your numbers. its meaningless work so its hard to be passionate about it or happy about it..  lots of people get away with not doing work which makes more work for those who actually tr harder... if you're in school this is an awesome job to make fast money but you can become very unhappy when you're stuck here and don't have many other options, but if you are one of those people the upside to this verses retail is you don't deal with the public."
good,Amazon is a fast paste job. You are required to meet a quota. Its easy to catch on to the work if you are a fast learner.During peak season be ready to work a lot of overtime.
good,"You will work 12-13 hour shifts, 4 days per week. Before each shift, you give a pre shift meeting with all associates. Productivity of workers is tracked and if they are not up to Amazon standards, it is your job to coach them. It can be a very stressful job at times, especially when productivity numbers are not high. I learned a ton in my short time with the company about how to run an operation and get the most out of my direct reports."
good,It was very quick and hard to keep up with. They put unusual strain on employees. The work environment itself was just fine but the quotas to which they want you to keep up are just unruly.
good,If it's not their peak season it's very slow there and they tell alot of people to go home but if it is peak season I recommend anyone who is fast pace to give it a crack
good,"Super competitive, ridiculous amount of favoritism. Hardly any chance of advancement. Poor management. Bad work life balance and it gets worse the higher the level of your position"
good,"This is a numbers driven business, and as such, numbers are required to perform the job proficiently.  The direct management did their jobs very well, but upper management, and HR left much to be desired from such a large company.  Worked for the company for 5 years, and got a great many of people hired on for seasonal roles, but all told me, they would not become full time employees"
good,It was a contract seasonal position. Lasted 2 months in picking and packing was interesting and met nice people and showed a good work effort. I would advise people to take the opportunity to learn from the different people that you work with.
good,"It is what you make of it, Try hard and you will do well. Slack and you will not. Great people to work with. Terrible work/life balance. Shifts change without warning."
good,It's was a work were I saw that there wasn't gonna be no advancement. You had sometimes where there was little fun in the work environment but I'm a person who is always looking to advance in better position and that is where they were lacking the most.
good,In meiner Arbeitszeit war ich hauptsächlich im Bereich packen zuständig. Eine Arbeit bei der man nicht viel denken muss da das System dir alles vorgibt was du zu tun hat. Oftmals war nicht genug arbeit vorhanden sodass ich öfters Heimgeschickt wurde trotz Minusstunden. Selbst in der Weihnachtszeit passierte dies öfters. Gelernt habe ich dort nichts und abwechslungsreich kann man diesen Beruf auch nicht bezeichnen da man Täglich immer das gleiche sieht und tut. Wenn man nach einem Aufregendem Job mit vielen interessanten Beschäftigungen sucht ist man im Versand von Amazon fehl am Platz.
good,Low wages and too much stress to make rates. Managers are cruel and insensitive. Commonplace to see management playing ping-pong in break room while demanding employees return to work and hit rate
good,Awful management.  You were treated like a number and all the employees were clicky and rude.  I was overworked and under appreciated.  I don't feel like I was being set up for success.
good,"It's a warehouse job so the job culture is a real mixed bag. One day it's a high school, the next day it's like Election Day 2018. While the benefits are great, the job itself is daunting and advancement seems to be based on WHO you know not WHAT you know (aka experience)."
good,Great work as long as you can ignore bad manager and don't have a need for work-life balance. It is very rare that you get kudos. The default state is the critique. You need to learn to learn from negative feedback to thrive here.
good,"Management often tells you different things based on the volume. The hours are inconsistent. The system for time-off and absences are often nonsensical but, for a physical labor job, the pay is good."
good,Las ETT nos mintieron pq nos dijeron que era un trabajo indefinido pero que ellos tenían que hacer contratos de mes hasta que la empresa nos cogiera y en la primera tanda nos echaron casi a doscientos
good,"working 12 hours a day 6 days a week with the work i did was hard and painful, during witch caused a injury and the companie would not move me to a new position"
good,Hot really sick with the flu. Doctor took me off with Dr note and orders & because I didn't have the 20 he's the told me to come back in 90 days after I'd been their for a year and just made it through peck..
good,"Amazon is constantly changing and is highly competitive. While I was able to learn alot there (working my way up from temp to management in 5 years) it wasn't because there were any programs to do so. I don't feel that this is unfair as this is the way logistics (or any business for that matter) works, however, I find it important to note that positive results are necessary in order to keep your job. As with any large corporation there are benefits and gaps in overall experiences. The benefits and work hours are predictable and reasonable (except during peak hours). There are often processes and systems in place in order to track results and heaps of data to dig into, which is very helpful. On the other hand, there are gaps in expectations of management, safety requirements and process changes. Safety policies often contradict themselves which can be frustrating to everybody. In contradictions like this it often feels like a free-for-all. There are also many expectations for management which requires a huge amount of prioritization. Overall, it's a great place to work if you can look adversity in the eye, and know how to deal with people above all else, using data to support propositions and results."
good,Amazon is an okay temporary part time job.  It is a physical job and no experience is required.  It is unskilled labor.
good,"I worked here for 6 years and was able to hit my targets with ease, the shifts where good as there was a days or nights to choose from. everyone there was very helpful."
good,"Because Amazon is such a huge company with so many different business interests, there's a lot of variation in people's experience working there. My first couple of years there were great, and although I was working way more than 40 hours a week, I didn't really mind that because my managers were very appreciative and my job was secure. All that changed when I got a new skip-level manager and they started managing me out because they wanted to eliminate my headcount. Had they been honest about wanting to eliminate the headcount, I could have totally understood that, but they weren't honest, and instead sandbagged me for bizarre, convoluted reasons until I finally quit. My point here is that it's possible to have a great experience at Amazon, but it's also possible to have a terrible experience through no fault of your own simply because of your management's whims. I ended up returning to Amazon as a contractor and enjoyed that experience much more than I enjoyed being an FTE."
good,Can be fun at times.  Bingo games. Prizes at Christmas. Monthly pay bonus are pretty nice. Managers not knowing their own job. They need better training.
good,"The job was only enjoyable when your are able to communicate and work directly with others, but such an activity was looked down upon. I felt like a number on a spreadsheet."
good,"Amazon was poorly managed, and their human resources was even worse. They expect you to work like robots and don't give you nearly enough time to rest. Their hours they have set for schedules is ridiculous too."
good,Amazon is a GREAT job for fresh out of college or high school students who do not have children or dependents.  working full time will burn you out. the work load is not bad but it will become boring after a while.
good,"There's not a lot of requirements for this job. However, they want you to maintain a certain speed when working in the warehouse that I found impossible to maintain. Especially since what the managers ask for a higher rate than even the company requires. If your rate remains too low, they will terminate you. I haven'y been let go yet, but it is only a matter of time."
good,Amazon is fast paced and if you don't make rate you will be fired. It's all about numbers. The people are sweet but the job is a job. Do the work and get paid.
good,"Definitely have to stay hydrated and well fed in order not to feel the physical tolls the demanding work takes on your body, as far as advancement you either push yourself truly or become buddy buddy with management. They seem big on favoritism versus people who actually put the dedicated work in. I wouldn't recommend any elderly to apply honestly."
good,"As a picker a typical day is driving a standing forklift through aisles with a telxon and picking items of various weights. At first it sounds fun until you do it for 10 hours. During peak season, it's mandatory 12 hour shifts and 60 hour work weeks from mid November until Christmas. No vacation time is accepted at this time per company policy. However you are still able to use PTO (paid time off) "
good,"This is a fulfillment warehouse job,. In San Marcos there are 2-3 big ones. Amazon does logistics  and warehouse shipping from this facility. Casual dress , jobs vary, depend on function. I am in quality control ."
good,"Are you a robot? Beep beep, boop boop, pull the order.  Beep beep, boop boop, move the order."
good,"This job is for the young at heart.  If you are over 50, then this job is not for you.  Pressure all the time to get the rate and if you do, then the rate they want goes up.  Stressful on your mind and body.  Been hurt many times and the last time was hospitalized for chest pain."
good,I do not want to write anything about this company. My mom told me if you do not have anything nice to say don't say it at all.........................
good,It's a good place to work at if you are single with no kids it's long hours somewhat good pay they have good benefits the only thing is that they put to much pressure on you. But over all I liked it no one really messes with you some people are friendly
good,"I walked an average of 20 to 30 miles a day, which was the hardest part of the job  Workplace culturally diverse in every aspect.  The most enjoyable part for me was actually staying busy the entire time.  It is not a place for the physically challenged."
good,Not enough money or never given raises. The management does not recognize or assist in company growth for hourly employees. They do not give raises and they are not generous with pay.
good,"I enjoyed working at Amazon in the beginning. Everyone was cool and now, everyhting changed. But the fact that they don't care about their employees, makes me very sad."
good,"The harder you work, the less meaningful opportunity you get. Use your cunning & administrative skills to constantly apply for promotions. Use their paid interviews to practice practice practice. Fail upward. If you have a degree & the ability to say “YES!” to everything, you’ll have no problem moving up!"
good,once you enter the plant you feel consumed by it. i feel if you were able to listen to music by way of headphones the job would be a lot easier and helpful
good,"Amazon isn’t a great place to work. The hours are long and tedious, and the three days you have off arent really what you think. You definitely won’t have a ton of time to yourself, especially not when they enter their peak season or prime week, where you can expect to work 60 hour weeks, likely 4-5 weeks in a row. If not more, should your FC management get permission to extend it. All being said, if the pay was worth it, it probably wouldn’t be as much of an issue. But with a starting wage that, at least in my area, wasn’t even livable, it’s really hard to convince yourself to go back to work day in and day out. Make no mistake, no one in the work area will care who you are, unless your rate is amazing or you go out of your way to cause issues. You’re under constant surveillance, so best of luck if you say or do anything big brother doesn’t like."
good,I was only a seasonal customer service representative so I did not stay with them for long. The schedule conflicted with my school/internship schedule anyway so I had to resign before the seasonal period ended.
good,"Need merit raises. Great work family great isurance, on site medical center and food center"
good,It’s a great job for a kid out of high school.  Only worked 3 hours per day and no benefits at all.  No pay raise no matter how long you’ve been there
good,"40 hours a week, tough shifts to be sure. But the pay is excellent, even on day shift. However as an associate there are a number of things that you will be excluded from regardless of how hard you work such as holiday events or competitions."
good,"The building I work in has a leadership team that only looks out for their own quick benefit instead of training and leading a team to success. Leadership teams come and go in waves, as they are promoted together and take with them who they know are ""yes"" men. Creates an atmosphere with lack of caring and effort."
good,"Part-time warehouse sortation associate primarily picking, moving and handling packages for delivery couriers.  Physical work with full body movement lifting and moving packages."
good,Funfortunately place to work until management starts playing the favorites game......if your not their absolute favorite person then they will write you up VTO you or flat out treat you like poo until you quit.
good,"It was a fun job at times very fast paced. Breaks weren't long enough for the strenuous work amount we did.  Very competitive.  Some of the team leaders are rude but you have a good amount that treat you like an adult and shows respect.  Its hard to move up the chain if your  not in the ""click"" or if you don't know anyone that has been there or has authority."
good,My hours of working was 6 pm-4am  these were wonderful working hours for me.  I enjoyed working as a forklift operator which gave me a feeling of accomplishment.   Needing benefits
good,"It has an unpredictable schedule, no benefits, and can either be slow going, or beyond stressful. Unfortunately, the entire staff of the PM division including myself were laid off last year due to ""low profits."" The last time I checked, the only department available in my workplace available for drivers (the AM division),  requires delivering a high volume of packages (200-400+ packages per work day) over a 10 hour shift. So unless you are experienced at delivering a high volume of packages annually, as well as dealing with the unpredictability of the management, this job isn't for you."
good,"It was a ok job, But require heavy lifting.. The staff was very helpful.. I would consider it a man's job, its like a workout.. But if u like working long hours, An can tolerate the lifting its ok.."
good,Based on my experience with this company I believe there is much room for improvement in the work and life balance area. Overnight shifts tend to create a serious problem with normal day to day responsibilities. More overnight donut shifts would help.
good,They just kept switching hours  and should pay their workers more. The managers seemed to be lost a lot so we kind of went off common sense. My co-workers were cool.
good,"It was interesting place to work. After 2 days of training, you are left by yourself to figure things out and learn things out by yourself. It is a very physical job."
good,"as seasonal everything is different compared to permanent employees. The difference was never stressed until the points were added up and it was too late. I was employed during the peak season. Stress was high getting the job done was on point, at the end of the day things that were brought to a supervisors attention were neglected such as points being taken care of things that were discussed to take care of points and to ensure employment were forgotten not taken care of and too late to change. Oh well right? I am not stressing but it is something that should be looked at and taken care of so it doesn't happen again.Over all i didn't hate working for Amazon."
good,"You work long days and the job is very physically demanding, but the pay is good. There is not a lot of interaction between you and management, so at times there is not a lot of direction given, and you're left to figure things out on your own."
good,There was no oversight of employees so a lot of them just did the bare minimum and a poor quality job.  It was difficult to watch and have to clean up for others.  Also it was dirty and dusty
good,"The worst management I ever meet in a workplace. They cannot manage people. Therfore they apply the slavery method. Raising targets without letting people know and then try to make people feel they do not work enough. "
good,fast pace . supervisors are very down to earth and accommodating. hours were  very flexible. The hours that they give they allow you to pick them yes the always have extra time. The shifts are broken down and i think the should be combined together.
good,I did not enjoy working there.  The hours were insane at times. My manager wrote me up for nonesense.  When you tried to talk to them they never were understanding.
good,"It's a warehouse job where you're working for 10 hours with 2 breaks, make sure you stretch and then when it's around september you start working 60 hour weeks with one day off"
good,i felt the environment was slow and not very challenging. The management was poor and i was unmotivated especially considering i wasn't being paid adequately for the time i put in and the miscellaneous jobs i was required to perform outside of my title.
good,It was stressful meeting production the equipment or line was always going down and you were not compensated. Getting out of there was the best part of the day. Management consisted of young people who didn't care
good,"Productive workplace great experience, no experience needed for job staff does great job of training and teaching safety procedures.  Paid holidays and also long hours during peak season."
good,"typical day would be to  arrived at work by 6:30am to"
good,the job it self is a good job but at the moment they hired to many people and the job is not promised and fair you could be a really hard worker and apply yourself and could patently get let go because of one mistake
good,"I was not allowed to move to any other department because of my manager, there were a countless number of times i tried to be trained in another department but my manager would not allow  it."
good,"Work Hard, Have Fun and Make History                        "
good,It's great that some of the christmas hires get opportunity to progress to full time. Meet great people and great shift patterns. Overal good company but it's very tiring
good,"Not a great Places to work unless Your a manager or better they will wear you out then fire you You will feel like a robot working here."
good,It pays alright money but I didnt favor the management or their regulations that kept changing. They pushed too hard. I want to remain anonymous for this review.
good,they keep upping your work load and they hired mangers strait out of college who never worked with people they were just computer geeks did not know how supervise peopal
good,"Amazon is a great place to work on paper.  Benefits from the get go, friendly atmosphere & very encouraging.  But, once you're established, its all about hitting rate & not messing up.  They even offer an appeal board if you want to try and over turn a write up or termination.  But, at my location, not one single person was heard of having a successful appeal hearing.  At the end of the day, you have to realize that you have no job security with Amazon.  Because they know that they can fire you & replace you with the snap of the fingers."
good,Job security was OK. Meant for hardworkers. Hard to move up because of politics. A lot of fake people overall if you keep to yourself and work hard you can be successful.
good,"My hours were from 6 pm to 4:30 am Wednesday through Saturday. 10 hr shifts very competitive and unreasonable. Very easy to make mistakes even if it didn't start from you, you could be the one that got the mistake. A Lot of favoritism, which made it hard to move up no matter how good you work."
good,"The Amazon culture is fun, but you need to bring your enthusiasm to the position. At my location, you can do very well in your position, but moving up really depends on whether your boss chooses you to train in other positions. Favoritism is through the roof in a new building and it's more or less just luck of the draw. If not chosen to move up, you can request to be trained in other areas, but it will fall on deaf ears. While my review may come across as scathing, this is the reality in a new building (as many managers are brand new and trying to assert their dominance in their position). To succeed and move up in the entry level (Tier 1) position to a (Tier 3) position, you need to get in good in managers (granted they also need to favor you too)."
good,"I enjoyed the work, it is a job that really keeps you focused. And the bosses were friendly and they showed the care about their workers. they had great benefits!"
good,"They want you to work as a robot. stressful, break room is very far. "
good,It was nice to be able to do different things besides just scanning if you were able to talk to the right person that could move you. If you werent a fast scanner then you werent offered other positions to move around which made the time go by faster. Most of the management were very helpful in training and helping your lane if need be.
good,"At group interview they'll ask ""what time you want to come in?"" But really that'll be the time you leave. The work not that stressful it's just the management in hours and time wasted. Breaks are 15minutes off top and working like 5 days a week."
good,stepping stone company  this is a great company for you to learn a skill set master it and move on to a better paying company that can pay what your skill set is worth.
good,Be prepared to fight for your job each day by meeting time task goals on each assigned shift.  This is a warehouse environment without any air conditioning provided.
good,"It's sad because this was actually a really amazing job that was ruined by the temp agency I was employed by. We never got paid properly or on time. There was zero job security. The management kept dangling the coveted 'blue badge' (i.e. full-time employment directly with Amazon) in our faces the whole time... 'oh, you will be made into blue badges next month... oh, you will be made permanent next year' etc. Just a heap of lies... they just didn't want to take responsibility for us, like most other companies these days. Easier to palm us off onto a temp agency."
good,The hardest part is standing 10hrs on concrete.  The most enjoyable is having 3 days off together. Amazon have really great benefits.  A typical day starts out with me setting productive goals for myself.
good,"Good Organisation, But no jab security and the management is not much cooperative and less responsive to our queries, As far as salary is concerned its very low as compared to other organisations."
good,I did not like working for amazon. They are way to hard on their works. They don't pay their employees nearly good enough. And they so appreciation to there hard workers
good,the management was terrible. very confused and not stable and ready to work. mostly understaffed and just all around wrong. poor attitudes and sometimes over worked due to not enough employees.
good,"Très difficile les longues journées en weekend-end, mais ça finit par payer!"
good,"If your looking for a job that at the end of the day praises you for a job well done well you may want to look else where! The hour's are long, expectations are high. The only other thing I will mention is Amazon is a constant revolving door with it's associate's, here today gone tomorrow type of mentality. So if your looking for  job security or a workplace environment that's enjoyable this may not place for you. In closing if your an individual that's only interested in a Paycheck and Health insurance than your good, but if your looking for something to make a career out of you my want to explore other options."
good,"1. Work culture is good."
good,There are few people who stay longer than two years because of the lack of advancement opportunities within the company. People move laterally frequently but very little vertical movement.
good,Nice place to work they were the partner of amazon.in i have work in sincere manner i will be complete my work in same day all the staff members will help what ever the doubt.
good,You can't voice your opinion it will cost you your job. It did me. Work is good stay busy all day. A lot of good people to work with.Some of the workers don't know there job and it makes it hard on you.
good,"Pros:"
good,12 hour shift   production  numbers more important than  health  attendance  well being of employees  managers not  properly trained production must be met or risk of termination
good,"Amazon is constantly changing rules and always adding new departments and taking old departments away. Hours were always changing and so was my LEAD and my team. As soon as you learned one policy they turned around and added a new one or changed something with the old one. You have to follow your reports of how many yeses you get from the customers, You have to maintain call handle time as well as after work call, You have to make sure your Aux states are correct and you have to stay off reports so that your LEAD can get a raise."
good,Its a tough job and very physically demanding.  Long hours on your feet so make sure to wear comfortable shoes and prepare to sweat so keep a water bottle handy.  Very numbers based group.  Don't make your numbers they will walk you out the door.  If you get injured on the job the nurses will do everything in their power to prep you to go back on the floor.  Very few people stay long at this place considering there is a lack of advancement and they cap your pay after 2 years with the company.
good,"Work started out great. Working from home was fun and a new environment...however, I quickly learned it was NOT for me. On top of that I was moved into a department with no training, no support, and was left to sink. It was an extremely rough and stressful position to be in."
good,"Didn't enjoy the job due to the pace , the mangers attitudes on helping the new comers. Break times were not as long , didn't have many benefits , wasn't worth the pay."
good,Fast past and very productive. Come prepared to work. The work place environment is friendly.  Managers are friendly but it's hard to get direct answers from them.
good,very fast paced job with a ton of  favoritism towards certain people from managers.Expect to do work for 2 or more people. pay and hours were the only good thing about the job.
good,I worked for close to a year for Amazon as a driver. The turnover rate was ridiculous. Every week we had new employees. Amazon also change their operation structure multiple times while I was employed. Every week was a new experience unfamiliar experience.
good,"Staying in the same place for 10+ hours"
good,"If you are a person that has any skills and want to use them do not work for Amazon. Poor place to work with little to no advancement opportunists. And, when or if you gain skills they will not increase your pay as you develop in the company. This work is for people who do not have any education or much work history."
good,"Amazon is a great place to learn and develop your own skills.  You can make your own ideas become a reality and change the world.  Unfortunately, Amazon is not for everyone.  The average employee lasts less than two years for many reasons.  For some, its just not the right fit.  For others, the work-life balance is doesn't work.  There are many opportunities to move from team to team and learn different aspects of the business, but advancement becomes limited once you hit a certain level."
good,Horrible supervisors it was a lot of favoritism within the work environment. I did not like the mandatory overtime we was forced to do. There was not a lot of room for moving up in different fields.
good,"Easy to get in, difficult to move up..........."
good,"This is for delivery station positions. Managers worry more about not getting fired, and will throw anyone under the bus. Lack of training and development. Management ignores concerns unless its coming from their superiors."
good,"It's a good place to work, we've had a lot"
good,"its okay, the environment can easily become boring, due to non promotion. Also, Amazon is a good place to work as a part time, nothing else. Hardest part, is dealing with lazy workers."
good,"Management is poor, really isn't the best place to work at. If you enjoy working alone and standing for 8+ hours then it's probably not so bad but your back and feet really start to hurt."
good,"Management and progression are shocking. They only promote people who they are friends with or brown nosers. Not a care in the world for people who care about there work or who are good at the jobs they do. Also God help if your an old employee of 3 or more years they couldn't care less about you. "
good,they were not very helpful and some of the managers that worked there are mean and rude and not helpful. They sent us home a lot cause they didn't have enough work for us.
good,"The culture was great at first then it degenerated to making everyone robots new managers every 3-6 months the most knowledgeable employees are the lowest paid, once a manager finally starts to get comfortable they are transferred."
good,they do not value workers that show up for work everyday. always busy with plenty of work.bottom rung managers are not to bad but they need More management training. they only worry about the numbers. the company has top insurance but the wages need to be higher.
good,"It's a good company, however, the management team working there makes it difficult. And the work-life balance is just utterly disgusting. Also, the management team doesn't even introduce themselves"
good,Get ready to move and sweat as you walk around the warehouse your entire shift minus the break times! HYDRATE!!! Can't say enough about that. Must be willing to go with the flow as things can change at the blink of an eye.
good,"I loved the work /people, but being over 50, trying to keep up was painful. I asked for a more intellectual job,less physical on my body, but was told that I had to wait 3 months."
good,"lavoro pesante,ripetitivo, non tutti hanno modo di migliorare la propria posizione. Meritocrazia non esiste. La parte piu dura del mio lavoro è il picking, si stimano circa 15 km al giorno ,non esiste una parte piacevole del mio lavoro perchè è molto stressante."
good,"Shift management (8p-1a) did not appear to be in sync, or knowledgeable in regards to exit strategy regarding safety of all employees."
good,The job it self was not hard we would first start by unloading the trucks putting all the boxes on belt rollers that will divert them to where they need to go.
good,"Working in amazon is great. Great people and great work, but favoritism is seen there. They don't give equal opportunities to other people. They tend to favor a certain batch of people."
good,"If only Amazon put as much time and effort into training and legtimately caring for employees as they do the actual company and satisfying the customers this would be a better place. Constant mass emails are sent out telling you to cut your break time. A lot of suppose to be ""team leaders"" avoid offering help even when you reach out with questions or concerns. Training which is self led and taught is completely MEDIOCRE! They don't really care if you understand the concept or fundamentals of taking calls or not as long as you complete the self training and afterwards you are forced to take calls. When you first start higher ranking CSA's are required to accept transfer calls that you haven't been trained to handle (although you're really not trained in anything) but, they will constantly deny your transfers. Training is avertised as two weeks which is a complete lie! Your ratings and reviews are completely damaged due to the lack of training."
good,"Regardless of supply & demand big companies are forgetting that people have families and lives. Throwing more money at the problem but cutting off the time workers share with their loved ones on Thanksgiving (for example) is absolutely ridiculous. "
good,Amazon is a tough place to work. The pay is good but you will work hard for every penny of it. The great thing is that you get health benefits the day you start.
good,"The Hr manager was sending me emails threatening to fire me for ""missing 3 scheduled shifts"" before i had even set an orientation date.After 4 days of working the hr then fires me for ""Job abandonment""  saying i haven't been to work at all.I am supposedly supposed to be rehired because this was a mistake but its ridiculous.I have to keep calling the associate support line to try to keep my job and not be fired for no reason."
good,This is best company. manager work is costumer like that process sale to company about company  but work agent ly .company is very benefit this work manager opreter
good,it was a quick paced job along with being very stressful when it came to meeting a certain rate every single day. They have become very strict on restroom breaks and lunch breaks. I would not recommend working unless you love being pushed way beyond your work limits.
good,"I worked at amazon for about 3 months and while the pay was good, it wasn't worth the 10 hour work day. Management sucked. no one knew what they were doing at all."
good,"I actually enjoyed working there for the first year, I worked my butt off and moved up to problem solving (just walk around with a laptop and fix problem) then eventually to Process Guide (PG) which involved helping manager and leads staff and manage, however the reason I left was the workplace culture everyone and I mean EVERYONE disliked working there, everyone complained about how they hated working there or they wanted a new job it really takes a toll after a while, the turnover rate was insane, it seemed like there was new hires every month because so many people would leave for new jobs or just up and quit, there are also so many people working together (about 200 people in my department alone) that it creates drama, a lot of people don't get along, honestly the best way i can describe it is its something like high school."
good,"standing on feet for 10 + hours was really hard on feet even with the three days off and  not enough training time and really stress out when your numbers don't go up fast enough ,"
good,"Its a great job if you enjoy working with customers all day on the phone and don't mind being tied to your desk.  It can be tedious, same thing day in and day out."
good,"There was no one for me to talk to directly, face-to-face, about an employment problem. we were told to call an ""employee hotline"" and to wait for a callback.... I never got that callback. the HR lady was there like twice a month and it was hard trying to get to her because all the other employees had their questions and problems. This only gives me the impression that they don't care about employees, yes you have good benefits but before those kick in, you would run into SEVERAL other problems. you're always on your feet except when you take your 15-minute break (between 5-hour work shifts, sometimes more, in my case)  or use the bathroom, but they tell you about that before you get hired. one good thing is they make you do 30-second stretches before work so you won't pull a muscle. another good thing is they don't care about tattoos or piercings or hair colors, just don't wear anything offensive, and there is no uniform (but you ALWAYS have to wear your safety vest and badge in the warehouse area). They do ask that you cover your armpits and toes and no flats."
good,Amazon claims to let you be your own individual. Actually you're considered a threat if you a different opinion on anything. Management pick and chooses to enforce whatever rules and policies to suit them.
good,"Not a bad place to work, and probably reasonable compensation, but a great deal of emphasis placed on productivity with little interest in quality. Job also involves physical challenges for those not in good shape."
good,"Long hours but not much in promotions because of limited availability. Expect to be micromanaged often and don't expect to be thinking outside of the box too often. Overall its a job that provides decent pay depending on where you live, but expect to bust your butt for it."
good,"It's a very convenient position for those who are looking for a little money on the side, but if you're planning to do this full-time, forget it. The amount of shifts available are very few, I can hardly pick up any these days."
good,"Be sure to always keep your best interests above those of your management, it's to be ""chew right through staff"" environment. Do not hesitate to contact HR if you have inadequate management."
good,The benefits are the only good thing at Amazon. A lot of stress. Poor communication. HR was not helpful. Can not trust some of your coworkers. Cut throat environment.
good,This company is a great start for someone who is looking for a first time job  with 41K and benefits. Work life balance is not the friendliest if you have kids. there are 10hrs in a shift you need to work 4 days a week. works for some but not all.
good,"This company has a lot of work to do, especially in the HR Services space. I think that it could be improved with more accountability for it's management and improved company culture."
good,"Very stressful place to work at unless you are working under the right management and with the right people, otherwise everyone is always trying to get you fired."
good,A job to pay the bills outside of my passion for interior design which I am seeking at the moment. I also work cleaning homes and offices to assist my child with his college fees.
good,The hours suck but the pay and benefits are decent. If you can physically handle the work you'll be fine but a lot of people ware our withing the first year or so.
good,Unloaded parcel trucks and stocked warehouse as needed.  Fielded orders from vendors and fulfilled backstock orders as well.  Workplace culture not quite there compared to other fulfillment centers.
good,"Overall I enjoyed working at Amazon, although the culture seemed to shifting from the causal laid back atmosphere that made Amazon such a great place to work to a much more rigid, numbers-centric job rather than making sure the customer is happy, no matter how much work or how long it takes."
good,"Constantly pushes you to grow and develop, learn new things and go outside of your comfort zone. But it leaves no room for a work life balance, you always have to put work first or you will fail at Amazon."
good,The work at Amazon was consistent and constant and i enjoyed working for them. They also believed in employee rewards as well as keeping employees motivated..
good,I have no comments to make on this company. There might have been many changes after i have left this company. Please refer to current employees for any information
good,"It's a overall decent company but just not a place to stay for to long, also management sucks and they have no idea what they are doing. The pay is very bad but the work is not that bad also management likes to pick on people and take stuff person."
good,"management went downhill, very little recognition to employees who have good work ethic, decent health care benefits, some ability to relocate within the company"
good,Very easy work and fun people but the hours aren't so great. Lots of Amazon terminology and rules to learn. VERY short breaks. Employees don't get the appreciation and rewards that they should receive for helping the company surpass their daily goal.
good,"First day of work was pretty rough because you walk like about 10 miles in that warehouse. its huge. managers were decent workers but they were bad at initiating and understanding their employees. Normally a 10 hour shift would go quickly but it felt like a life time, you cant go to the bathroom without them complaining that you used 5 minutes of their time. they only care about the production more then the life of the employee. which is understandable to a certain degree, due to the lack of knowledge of managing and due to the lack of training, they did everything bad. barely ever motivate us. if i was in my station talking to my cowoker infront of me, they would move one of us, or they would tell us not to talk. the thing is in that job, its like your a prisoner, its just coming from my perspective view and my opinion. i dont know how they other people feel their, and my main concern, that the warehouse wont succeed if they keep going that way,"
good,"Good money but poor management ,they changed hour from 10 to 11 in a work day mandatory overtime all the time. All they wanted was there numbers to be right ND to meet they quoter for the day."
good,"Amazon.com was a temporary job assignment that was very close to my previous place of residence. Although a somewhat productive work environment, in my personal opinion, Amazon cripples itself due to lack of communication between departments and also management."
good,"amazon has amazing benefits, but cant keep employees because their miss communication of there polices suck ....management is younger then over half of the staff members . they are obsessed with power .. there is few to none minorities in high positions .. they rarely move from packing."
good,"not an ideal company for a family man with kids and other responsibilities, your whole life have to be dedicated to amazon. only to get paid $12 and hour which is not worth being gone from sun up to sun down and driving 35-40 minutes to and from work each day"
good,Loading van with heavy package count. Verifying packages making the correct driver has them and is sending them to right area.
good,"Its a fast paced environment, physical fitness is a must but the rush to meet targets and in effect shipping deadlines puts quality at risk. many items are damaged in the rush leading to losses for the company. wrong items are picked in a hurry."
good,Amazon's promotion process rewards people who have better visibility with people who have no idea about your work. Leads to internal politics about who you know and how you can get your name known across the org in order to be promoted. People's incentives are aligned to drive poor treatment of those who cannot help you get promoted.
good,Work Hard have fun make history. As a 5+Amazonian I will say the company is an excellent company to work for. The management structure and variations of principal enforcement of productivity and other concerns is simply the reason most end up leaving. Lacking clearly understood leadership with the Sr. leadership teams and regional teams who lack the understanding of strong defined leadership and when in a position outside their scope have the ability to pin outside factors on one of stature and Tenure. I worked as a (TT) top tier reviewed Amazon employed for 5+ years and within two months a change in leadership changed the outlook of my career with the company with no recourse for the past years proven performance. Policy and procedures used for such endeavor's were lacked and not in compliance and yet still utilized as if I had been there for 5 minutes not 5 plus years. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any further questions or would like to know more detail about my review.
good,Productive workplace no proper breaks to much pressure . If employees need to use the washroom have to wait for someone to come and cover there station which can take up to 10 minutes managers not very helpful all of the supervisors seem to be just standing around I guess that's what there job is
good,Job advancement & security could be addressed at a better organized & professional level . Training is at a personal ability level and mostly hands on. Production and quality is of utmost importance. Safety is at top level and prominent in the client environment.
good,Working at amazon is tough. They watch every move you make. They are quick to warn you and write you up and eventually fire you. Overtime is mandatory! If you don't have time to cover you will be fired quickly.
good,Amazon has a lot of great incentives and good benefits but that can all be affected by management. I really liked working here but the managers spoiled the job for me. They were very unprofessional so thats what affected my position there.
good,"a typical night consists of packing 150+ items per hour hour for 3 hours then a 15 minute break. working another 4 hours then a 30 minute lunch break. working 4 hours then a 15 minute break. working another 2 hours. I learned I could pack a lot faster than I thought. The management was all over the place and very inconsistent with demands and objectives. the workplace culture is very isolated. No team spirit whatsoever, was every man for himself. Hardest part of the job was lack of breaks or the limits of the breaks. The most enjoyable part was meeting your targets and passing them as it made a difference to production overall."
good,"I enjoyed working with this company, however there is very little room for advancement or learning new processes in the department you are in. It is a very fast paced and physically demanding job. Management doesn't always communicate to one another about information that is given. It cave me a variety of people to work with and get to know."
good,It's a job. Nothing really special about it. You come to work and do what you have to do to keep your job. The benefits are good. Not a job where you can see yourself really advancing far.
good,"Trust me when I tell you, I fought them to change my schedule for school. They fired me for answering a phone call....conveniently after the holidays."
good,"I did it all at OAK4 tracy. The pay was decent, your coworkers are amazing. It is the most unorganized, big company you'll ever work for. The revolving door, is like a slaughterhouse."
good,Good money for the job you do at that time of year  always try accommodate your shift by how you travel to work not practical if you don't drive or can't get a lift as a bit out the way
good,Not an awful place to work however the job is very repetitive and boring. There is a large amount of overtime available but the time of year I was working there were many hours of 'compulsory' overtime which wasn't excellent.
good,"Warehouse ABE8. Rumors, fights. You would swear this was high school. The benefits and pay are amazing but there's always a catch. No job security ..."
good,If you need a job cause you are straight out of high school. this would be the job to get because it is a way for you to work and go to school at the same time.
good,I worked from home for a few months. The worst part about the employment was the training. I am unable to grasp how to do things via phone conference and powerpoint. I enjoyed the training while we were not on the phone with the Team Lead because I was able to focus the way I needed too.
good,"I have worked at amazon a few time as a temp and once as a blue badge, the system is set up for failure, you never know what your accurate rate is, and the amount you need to make rate changes. you dont get pardoned for lack of work. favoritism, management changes several times a year. the benefits dont compensate for the pay difference. some temps would make 2 dollars more than full time employees. the insurance isnt the greatest, and the hr dept doesnt really seem to have the employees in their best interest."
good,"Since working at Amazon, I've noticed a big increase in staff and expectations, but employees who work the hardest don't usually get all the praise they deserve. I believe Amazon lacks in employee moral support."
good,"not managed very well rather disorganised "
good,"its a fun place to work and my co-worker are lively, but the workload is too much at the warehouse I will recommend this job for a male because you will be lifting throughout the shift"
good,"Good Pay/Management Issues. Nice benefits but people had favorites and it should in level of accountability."
good,meet some nice people but you get enough time to clock in an out from breaks as tea rooms are so far way its unrealistic managers give you points for clocking in one minute late even if its taken you five minute's to clock in as so many people are in front of you six points and your sacked its unrealistic
good,"I can't say that Amazon as a whole is terrible but my specific location was terrible. The hiring process was relatively easy for me, initially got back to me quickly. After being hired, my recruiter practically disappeared. The training for the job is sad. Managers often don't let you finish your training. Non-peak season you work 4 days a week, peak season gets crazy, often with un-needed overtime. Upper management is terrible. They don't know what they're doing and change their minds constantly. A lot of favoritism goes on. You're there an hour before shift and an hour after. The job is not difficult, your associates will be your favorite part. Taking a lunch or break is frowned upon."
good,Amazon is a good place to work for.But dedication in terms of handling of volume of work(which requires more time) has been the case in my case than anything related to quality
good,I appreciate the opportunity of working at Amazon but they don't really care about their employees at all. The way work day is not really guaranteed .
good,"Great benefits after 1 year mark , manangent needs a little work.very fast pace and they don't have any problem getting rid of you , your always walking on egg shells , you only have a certain amount of time you can take off, you get personal like 40hrs (4 days) ,80 (8 days) and vacation accruing 1.35 days every 2 weeks for a year(32 hrs)-3 days and 2hours mandatory OT could be called 12hrs before a shift suddenly usually 4 day shifts on 5 with overtime ."
good,I worked here for about 4 months and i probably got paid like 2 times. They constantly delay on paying you also you never know if you are for sure going to work that day until you get there. Also the management is not good at all.
good,"I worked there for 2 years and took the buyout. They have little events and play games sometimes that are fun but...Never have I been anywhere so micro-managed in my life. If you were breathing wrong, they dinged you for it. They set high rate goals and play favorites heavily. I was a favorite of my manager and got a lot of perks. I tried to work hard, but once they terminated that manager, I was sent back to packing from being a Lead. If you can suck up and don't mind a brown nose, you can make it there no problem. If you want a paycheck and that is it, you can do it. If you want to make a career, keep looking unless you have a MBA."
good,"I liked working with my Coworkers a lot, and being part of a team. I felt like I grew a lot as a programmer of during my time with Amazon. I learned a lot about some of the better development practices at Amazon including Continuous Deployment, Service Oriented Architecture, Dependency Injection."
good,"Il ne faut pas se faire de fausse idées vis à vis d'Amazon. Il s'agit d'un travail en usine. De la réception à l'expedition de marchandise en passant par la mise en stock. Ils proposent énormément de poste car il y a beaucoup de travail à effectuer. C'est dure c'est vrai mais ce n'est pas non plus le pire métier. Ils donnent leur chance à beaucoup de personnes qu'elles soient jeune ou non, avec de l'expérience ou non. On peut y trouver une très bonne ambiance grâce à des collègues mais personnellement je trouve qu'il n'y a pas de reconnaissance pour le travail accompli. Ou en tout cas pas assez pour ceux qui le méritent vraiment."
good,The job is easy but you don't get enough hours I like the people easy going nothing bad about it. People do get frustrated but it will pass .
good,Working at Amazon has been one of the hardest jobs for me because it is a very fast paced work and very repetitive. We are Working for 10 hours with small breaks and hard to talk to anyone since it is a fast paced job.
good,"A good company to work at in general. Loved getting to know new people and learning about the online retail "
good,"Management takes advantage of the hard workers, and shows favoritism to a select few. Loved the benefits that came along with being an Amazonian, but couldn't enjoy them due to overworking."
good,"When you show up you have to leave everything in your locker and walk through a metal detector.There is a meeting and stretching before every shift and after lunch. Once the meeting is done you go get your order picker and basket and start picking your orders. You get 15 minutes breaks that begin when you leave your order picker. By the time your 15 minutes is up you are required to already be in your order picker and strapped up. Your 15 minute break ends up being about 7 minutes, even less if you have to use the restroom. The shifts are 12 hours long, which make it hard to spend time with your family or get much done through out your day."
good,"Warehouse work. Somewhat like a prison inside. Boring and stale. Too many ""rates"" to meet. Decent pay, decent flexibility and advancement opportunities. Good people to work with."
good,Working at Amazon is not a bad experience however there in not much room for growth. The workers are friendly and easy to get along with. We have some fun but at this time l am working only part time
good,Forget about having a life during the holidays. You will be working 11 hours a day for 5 days straight. Your supervisors are great. No complaints about them. Also the bathrooms still suck. The HR department is completely tone deaf.
good,"salary and benefits are good, work life balance not that great. work politics are more. more than work lot of call to attend"
good,intense rapide travail répétitif après tout dépend du poste après l ambiance rest bon enfant
good,Hot and stressful is a typical night at work. Management is management. Co- workers are fun. Hardest part of the job is the stress. Most enjoyable part of the job is the associates.
good,"no advancement to grow within the company, they timed you just to use the bathroom! Not the best job to work at and its only seasonal positions that are available"
good,It's hard to advance from contract worker to full time employee. I learned alot of computer programs and skills. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting everything done and beating other studios.
good,"Chef d'équipe très strict, a la limite du désagréable - peu de temps de pose ( 10 ou 15 minutes ) dans une salle qui se trouve a au moins 5 minutes du poste de travail"
good,The most appreciable asset that amazon has to offer would be there ability to allow their associates an opportunity to create their work schedule to be flexible with their college schedule.
good,"lots of randomization and context switches for both Individual Contributors and Managers."
good,"Identifying and implementing strategies for building team effectiveness by promoting a spirit of cooperation between team members"
good,"I've been with Amazon for almost 2 years now, and there are many internal systems and procedures in place that are broken and that need work. "
good,"I was hired to be a full-time picker, but volunteered for an ICQA ""temporary project."" The project is now full-time and there are no hopes of transferring to another job because I have one ""written warning"" on my record (for quality rates) which will be expunged from my record after 90 days, if I'm lucky to improve my rates."
good,"Could be a better environment, co workers are rude as well as some of the supervisors. Pay could be a little more higher for the type of work that is done. Most enjoyable part was getting off of work and the hardest was the job within itself"
good,easy place to work but they do not care about the employees like they say they do ...a lot of favoritism...you really can not move  up with in the company they also do a lot of policy changes and do not let us know
good,"The employer gives an assignment daily.  Each day you have to check to see where your work area will be. This is a stand up job, therefore management required pre-stretching daily in a group along with a safety meeting reminder.  I believe this job added to my production skills. For me the hardest part of the job was the location.  The most enjoyable was the ability to obtain additional work hours."
good,This warehouse was new so not that bad but typical warehouse structure. I would not work here again do to the lack of progression and how strenuous the job is.
good,"I've worked at Amazon for a long time. I started with no intention of long term employment by the company, and learned a lot while I was there. It was a great company to work for. The most enjoyable part of the job is the team I lead. They are an exceptional group of people. The leadership team is the most difficult part of the job to deal with. They don't treat everyone in a fair way, and seem to enjoy when people get in trouble. Coupling that with their obvious lack of knowledge and social skills, and it leads to very low morale. Instead of hiring talented leaders from within the warehouse, the leadership team seems to have a preference to hiring college kids. This would be acceptable if it didn't account for a majority of the hiring. It's unfortunate that we are forced to deal with such poor choices for leaders when there are very highly qualified, skilled and proven leaders in the organization who would make exceptional leaders, but are often forced to transfer buildings or leave the company completely to get the opportunity to show off their talent."
good,fun place to work. lots to learn. operations team sucks big time. otherwise pretty nice place to be a part and work culture is amazing.
good,"If you looking to supplement your income as far as a part time job its "
good,"Immediate Management does not, in any way, understand real management skills."
good,"Extremely fast paced"
good,"Because Amazon is ALWAYS hiring, this is a great position for someone who is eager to work like I was. I've worked for Amazon twice(via Integrity and as an Amazonian) both times I was a picker, working 6:00pm-4:30am. This position was physically and mentally demanding, I eventually resigned from Amazon because I could no longer take the stress I was putting on my body. I have a 2-year old at home and there were days I didn't sleep/rest, was too tired to interact with him, choose sleeping over eating, and just didn't sleep at all. This job is not one to have if you have young children or a family, simply because there is no balance between the 2. All you do is work. There is really no advancement here unless you've been with the company for years."
good,A day at amazon was slow and they expected to much on your first day out of the workers and so forth which i watched them fire a lot of individuals for no reason
good,"This company will pretty much hire anyone with an ID and kids just coming out of college who about 80% have never had a job and are in charge of about 50-60 associates at a time. Some buildings are based off production rates but this location claimed not to be which is a HUGE lie. Formerly being part of leadership we would go around throughout the day telling associates they need to move faster or they would be written up. Some of the managers don't care about what is going on within their team to even get to know their associates names. Other managers spent their days flirting with their associates while making their PA's do their work. But there are a very small few Leaderships they actually care and are willing to help, the others however could care less. Most of Leadership are more worried about the gossip going around then trying to make sure what was being done. Would also like to mention that this building isn't that safe when you think about it... You can pretty much bring whatever you want (phone, keys, knife, gun, etc.) into the building, but will have a hard time getting anything out. Again they will hire anybody with an ID."
good,We are not aloud to post anything negative about Amazon while still employed there the positives are they have decent benefits and the have a career choice program that pays for your schooling
good,"You either worked day or night shift. Very hard to move up to a higher position. Lots of favoritism. Very diverse.Overall fun environment to work in. Can seem like you are in high school all over again. Poor management. Non credible HR team. You have to keep up with your own PTO and VTO because the clock doesn't always account the time correctly, and the managers often don't put in the spreadsheets for VTO"
good,"Mandatory Overtime called weekly and only given 12 hours notice.  During the holidays mandatory overtime is called so often you don't even get a chance to spend any time with family.  The job is excellent if you are young and single with no family, otherwise it is extremely difficult to balance work and family life."
good,A great place for people starting out in the workforce. Good team atmosphere. Safety of the associates was a very high priority.
good,employees are helpful. days are long and sometimes unnecessary. management needs more training and didnt know how to do the job of their workers.
good,"A typical day is 4/10hr shifts, with the ability to learn new things everyday. Management and co-workers are a pleasure to work with.  The hardest part of the job is when they change things but forget to tell all associates.  The most enjoyable part is seeing my co-workers smile at a job well done."
good,"A typical day consist of a  Herd of people trying to rush and squeeze past each-other on a work floor. I learned to be overly observant and how to work extremely fast. When your 15 minute break is over management sends supervisors in with whistles to scream at you. If your late back from your break trying to get a drink management doesn't care they deduct your pay and even write you up. Most of the management I came into contact with were not friendly, rude, sarcastic, and even obnoxious. My fellow co-workers were good people but they were always misled by actual Amazon worker. The hardest part of the job is trying to get correct information about shift changes, pay changes, and parking. The only thing i enjoyed about working at Amazon was my check."
good,"My night shift would consist of walking around the Amazon building for over 9 Hours each night for a minimum of 5 nights a week, it was very tiring and boring. I felt like Amazon didn't care about their workers and how they might feel as long as deadlines were being met they were happy."
good,Long work days and no time to see family or do anything out side of work. I worked seasonal so the benefits are unknown. The job was demanding but doable.
good,It really depends on the department and team you are working with. You can expect to work pretty hard to generate amazing results which is great but dont expect those results to be rewarded or acknowledged expect management to take those results for granted and offer nothing in return. Including career advancement. Also make sure you get a good manager. The team and manager determines whether or not you will be happy at your job. If the manager is bad dont expect to wake up wanting to go to work in the morning. If the manager is good than with the extensive hours and stress you have a good chance at enjoying the job.
good,"I loved working here until recently.  We took care to make sure the customers were getting exactly what they needed.  We were mostly US based for customer service until last year.  I've slowly noticed that amazon is bringing in more and more overseas agents, which cause customers to be more and more frustrated and by the time a customer gets to a US rep, the customers are so angry with the company as a whole, the customers rate my service poorly.  The rating system on how you are doing is based on these ratings the customers give.  I've received more ""no"" ratings in the last year than I have ever gotten in the time I've been at the company.  Not because I am doing anything wrong, it's due to Amazon's policies changing.  The vacation and time off policies could also be better."
good,Coming in for working starting your day that you have overtime on Sunday that you have to come in work. I learn fast pace and good rates. Management is pretty good some care and help others out. The co-workers its kind of like high school there have groups. Hardest part is keeping your rate up and keeping the fast pace. The  most enjoyable is get the week over with and spending time with family when your off that the only time you have with family.
good,"on a daily basis i would review goods and decide whether they were available to be re sold or not, i would also keep my work station tidy"
good,Good work place with helpful management. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.
good,"Basically, there are a lot of things to pick up and learn from Amazon. I was involved in Sort/Slide where packages are sorted and push to the respective lanes. I was also part of the scanning team where packages are scanned and placed for distribution."
good,"The company is very dynamic. Layers of red-tape is not needed to make important changes.  However the amount of time required to keep your position at Amazon is great, especially during peak season.  The upside is that Amazon's compensation is very good.  They pay well but you earn every penny."
good,I would pick orders that came up on the scanner for me to pick. it sucked. its to hot in there and you cant talk to anyone. the management are mean and don't ever help you with anything. Human resources sucks they don't ever get back to you with things you need or ask for.
good,"Fast pace was challaning, high numbers, great management, easy to work with. Site was closed to be moved to another city."
good,This company is all about the numbers. Long shifts with few breaks. People are expected to behave like robots. Management is clueless as to how the actual job works.
good,Enjoyed working in a fast pace environment and the employees were great.  Although I started at a crucial time I still was able to pick up the fast changing work environment.  A downfall this company does have is communication and disorganized.
good,it's a job.  No frills.  Most input is negative and there's no flexibility with employees that could be in their interest.
good,"This is an ok place to work but your chances for advancement are limited as too how much brown nosing youre willing to commit to, or if you have several years in the military"
good,"not a good job,  warehouse to far away,  not organised well and they expect too much from workers too stricked with breaks and clocking in if you are one minute late you get points if you get too many points you lose your job no matter your circumstances."
good,"I've work for Amazon.com for two years now and I have to say this job Crazy! I'll either come to work watching my fellow ""coworkers"" spend their time talking wasting time, getting in to fights,or swearing."
good,"I personally don't think they give efficient breaks nor do they truly care about their employees.  The hours they gave were over extensive and they truly don't care how much sleep you get to come back and provide work the next day.  They will tell you, you have a 15 minute break but you must clock out and clock in by the time you do this your break truly is only 8 minutes."
good,"Virtual user interface system could be a bit more organized and user friendly. The culture can drag you down a bit if your not a real bubbly type of person, and sometimes there can be too many meetings. I would recommend trying another virtual job before going here."
good,"Um dia dinâmica, com muitas decisões operacionais a serem tomadas logo no período da manha."
good,"You can only hear the warehouse around you. Good luck hearing the person behind you (Even if it is your manager screaming into a megaphone). Management, well, they can't manage. Typical day, it was just not worth it to me. Considering When they said I was terminated, I looked at them and said ""Are you serious?"" And turned and left. They couldn't have got me out of that building any quicker, voluntarily."
good,I liked working in this warehouse for the first 2 weeks. After I started work there the staff became horrible towards other workers.
good,"It takes a special person to leave the pressures of life outside of work when you clock in for the day. Upper management requires a lot out of sort center management and prevents them from developing talent. also it fosters a turn and burn mentality amongst the management. They really are themselves are geared towards the metrics because the division is so new that they themselves are trying to move up. so it seems to get lost that you have to develop talent as well. The day can be stressful because of the uncontrollable factors such product being influenced by consumer purchasing, weather not permitting volume, etc. Then it becomes a mad dash to off load workforce so they are not wasting operating budgets. I think the focus on the culture and process  details would make this place a better  working environment.  If you are not a natural around the facility its a long road from a development type environment.  Things change quickly and most times with very little communication. You really have to be chameleon like to move up fast."
good,"Lots of targets and repetitive tasks day to day. "
good,"There were a lot of downsides to this job. So much so there was a BBC Panorama documentary made concerning the hardships of my exact role."
good,"You are always busy and on your feet ,you can never say that you do not have anything  to do.never a dull moment,and a lot of incentives"
good,"Overall the job is OK, except for management. None of the managers know what is going on and all of the shifts have different rules and policies for doing the same job."
good,"A typical day of work consist of either sorting product from your computer station, or Palletizing boxes to the right destinations using an RF scanner. The hardest part of my job is that it can be repetitive. You may find yourself scheduled to do the same thing for days or weeks at a time. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people that i work with. They are friendly people who do the best they can to help you succeed."
good,"I learnt too many things as it was my first job, got to know how business works and what i can contribute to the business to make it feasible. I would want to implement all my ideas but there are few constraints which are stopping me. Management is also good. My co-workers are very helpful and its fun."
good,"Ich hatte früh und Spät Schicht, ich habe sehr nette Kollegen und nicht so höfflich Kollegen kennengelernt."
good,"You may get a good vibe from your team. You may work hard. You may be the most technical person in your hiring group.  However, if you don't appease the remote 'bar raiser' all of this is null and void.  There is a 'Leadership principals' rubric, be sure you tailor your answer around the leadership principal you select as most applicable to yourself, and not try to wow them with a successful project that demonstrates your ability to get things done."
good,I worked for Amazon with all the promises of being rewarded with substantial payments for overtime etc; Did this occur?? NO!! You start with a good work load and then the number of drops increases and increases and you put in about 15 to 16 hours daily and not get paid for the extra hours that you work!!!! There is also the no return with undelivered packages!!!!
good,"Hard working culture, very customer orientated, the work was easy and lost a stone and half"
good,"i worked for amazon for about a month i didnt enjoy it because the work security wasnt there and they expected compulsary over time wich i dont thing is very fair when your working 10 hour shifts then having to do another so many on top."
good,"Work day was work hard minor breaks and short lunches "
good,I did what I needed to do to support my family.  I was a student and had been out of the workforce for sometime.
good,"as a worker they expect too much out of you. always want you constantly moving and working, The work schedule is not fun (wed-sat) its hard to getting your full weekend and they dont pay enough."
good,Management expects you to make rate at all times. There could be a lack of work yet you are still expected to make rate. The 15min breaks are not a long enough time especially do to the building size & where your work area might be. No job security management will write you up for whatever reason they want. The the fulfillment associates at amazon desperately needs a union
good,"The job is very repetitive, but it's not bad. However, they don't care much about employees/temps, because they can easily replace people."
good,"A typical day begins with staffing decisions, followed by monitoring the flow of the operation and following-up with associates.  Being proactive and anticipating roadblocks is very important as well as being able to maximize productivity."
good,"Everyday I would train all new hires"
good,Its like being in prison but probably worse. No radio to listen to so youre just walking round in dead silence and when you stop to talk to someone the management are straight onn your back to carry on working. Way to regimented
good,"I was only seasonal , but it was a very confusing and stressful environment."
good,"Working for Amazon.com can be both a pleasure and nightmare. "
good,"too much favoritism and poor management"
good,"Ensuring the policies are implemented"
good,Selling high-end luxury make pre-owned vehicles and obtaining financing for customers with negative credit history.
good,Amazon is a fast pace business that works towards high customer satisfaction; therefore their employees have to flexible and adaptable; which can be difficult to combine with other responsibilities or commitments; such as childcare and studies. The business offers good development opportunities.
good,As an Ops Manager the role is very restricted compared to others with the majority of your tasks being micro managed by senior management. A very political atmosphere.
good,Picking the product for the pack line to ship to the customer. I wanted to see what it was like to work for Amazon. I heard all these great things and found that its not what I expected. Managements fairly new and the building is not doing well. My co-workers are mostly temps and really dont try hard to pick up on productivity. I feel they should have more amazonians and less temps and they would see a big difference. The hardest part of this job is the fact that its almost impossible to move up in the company. 
good,Long hours on your feet most of the day. In my particular department alot of walking short beaks nice people.
good,"Amazon was very productive, its the kind of job that will help you get into shape. they had great pay as well "
good,Transporters would take skids from the docks to the racks to stock so the pickers could complete there jobs without interruption. 
good,a typical day at work would be collecting my radio and forklift keys in the morning then a printed copy of pallet locations that have too  come down for pickers to pick for customer orders . after the sheet is complete and bulk pallets that come into the biulding have too be put up into the high racking . usually left too my own devices sometimes the work can be a bit hectic at peak times but nothing that cant be dealt with 
good,"just scan boxes. and on a time limit . alot of others on the floor , walking fast pace to get to the boxes to scan before tie runs out"
good,- verify schedule to demand and volume to capacity
good,• Shipping/ Receiving
good,"They only hire for seasonal workers during the Christmas holidays. You work for a good two weeks, then back to job searching. In order to work full-time you have to know someone personally from the inside."
good,"When there was lack of work, or mechanicial or power failure, we recceived no down time to help with our rates. If the bins were full we could not make rate either."
good,"Loved the work and people I worked with. I learned about warehouse work and processing. Co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was the long lines for the time clock, entering and exiting the building, waiting and finding parking, iding shuttle bus to building."
good,Very unorganized management talks to u any kind of way.you have to be back @ your work area @ exact time leaving you with only a 7 min break.
good,"I worked many many hours, did not feel appreciated for the work that I did. There was no job advancement unless you had a degee which I found very unfair"
good,"A typical day on the job required clocking in and then setting straight to work with a scanner to make sure all items are properly checked into the shelves to stock, I learned how to scan items and the proper bins which helped when the other workers would pick out the items listed on their scanners. The management was very helpful they are on top of everything. My coworkers were awesome I loved working with all of them and would definitely work with them again. I think the hardest part of the job was all the shelves and it being incentive pay but it was worth it I loved every minute of working there."
good,"i enjoyed working nice hours. Something i enjoyed at amazon as well is they gave us short breaks,"
good,"Working for Amazon was ok and looking back on it it wasn't so bad but the biggest downside to this job is that some of the standards/rules/regulations were ridiculous. It's difficult to explain to someone who hasn't worked there but nearly all of my co-workers speculated these rules were there simply so they had a reason to lay us off when the time came. The hardest thing about the day was that you had to stand up for 8 hours straight in a really long aisle, usually on your own. It taught me about warehousing and health and safety. My co-workers were great. Overall I didn't dislike it but I didn't like it either."
good,"Warehouse job very blue collar standing and walking for 8-10 hrs a day walking up to 15 miles a day, and heavy lifting up to 50lbs repeatly."
good,Its good for passionate coders but there is lag for employee satisfaction
good,Amazon is great! Can be pretty demanding individually at times but all in all a pretty solid job.
good,"The pay is very good, and coworkers are for the most part always friendly. But the long hours  combined with almost constant overtime will wear on you. Management is hit or miss, and the culture within the company is some of the most culty i've ever seen"
good,"I really enjoyed working with the team it was fantastic for me meeting new people and good facilities for the employees. But the work was very busy but l managed to complete the contract."
good,Numbers and rate is the only thing they care about. The 10 hour night shift is exhausting when u realistically all get 40 minutes of break time.stay away
good,"I worked at Amazon overnight. The job itself is pretty laid back, but staying on your feet for 12 hours overnight can get tough. They are strict on you meeting your quotas, although the management will let you work independently most of the time."
good,You arrive at a stand up meeting to await the distribution managers to hand out routes that have been pre prepared by amazon and given to chosen distributors. Your distributor provides equipment and a vehicle. After you have loaded your vehicle you must leave station. The hardest part of the job is loading the 250-300 various sized packages into the vehicle.The most enjoyable part of my day is delivering the final package assigned to me.
good,"Really easy work, with the industrial cleaning side there isn't loads you can do in a 12 hour shift 4 days on and 4 days off, there will be different teams of you sectioned to certain areas of the building, meaning your picking up where ever the last group left off or waiting around for a spillage to ruin somebody's day. wish there were more things to do while on the job. making work in the mornings and over the nights really slow."
good,I don't feel appreciated nor do I believe that we are treated fairly. Unless we suck up to our PA we don't get treated correctly even if we are great at our job
good,Poor Management needs better communication throughout company. Also benefits are not good at all! jdfdsjsjsjsjsdjdsjsdjsdjdsjdsjsdjdsjdsjsdjsdjsdsdjjsdsdjsdjksdjk
good,"Nice temporary job. No room for advancement ."
good,The company uses a staffing company to fill in the gaps during its peak season. They have a high turnover rate possibly done to save the company money. It's a hit or miss on employment depending on if HR is fully staffed.  I suggest going directly to the Amazon job site if you're seeking employment to save time. This company is not a bad place to work if you don't mind long hours and want to have decent benefits and pay.
good,"People are better than the managers. The place is hectic and is dire need of change. The people have a nice culture going for them. The days can be both busy and slow, just depends on orders and workloads."
good,I slipped a disk in my back and they refuse to approve the surgeon for my back then told me to furnish documentation from the doctor they refused to approve then terminated my employment for failure to show up for work when I was on medical leave and had moved and transferred locations 8 months prior.
good,I am a former employee who underestimated the amount of work that I would have to do an Amazon and I would recommend Amazon to those that are looking to start at a decent wage
good,Not recommended for long term careers. Timelines are crucial and there is the stereotypical artificial employee based culture. Management does what they can but policy is not worker friendly
good,"Be ready to work "
good,"It was fun with the people I meet. The HR team and the management had no clue what they were doing and messed up a lot of peoples medical leaves, and LOAs."
good,"In the beginning everything is peacy as with all jobs i assume but as time goes on you begin to realize not only are the hours not enough to compensate for day to day living but also the fact that in that particular facility, the management team doesn't pay attention to it's endless supply of temporary workers unless it's to review bad performance. all in all a bland work experience."
good,not good for long term unless you want to move up and want your life to become your career. flexible hours come and go as you please using your allotted time off. developed back pain after working there long enough.
good,"lack of communication, a lot of member of staff not speaking English"
good,"The company that I worked for was okay, as a driver you will be working outside which means in all weather. You are expected to deliver all packages within a certain time frame. Being a driver you are your own supervisor throughout the day really so if you like that then that's a plus and you get to kinda pick the days you can work."
good,"Tiring and self motivation job"
good,"Definitely not a worth place for seasonal associates..worked as robots, maintained excellent rating  but got termination letter in return saying that they don't have anything to do with productivity but work load is less now..How can you justify the good work with low work volume??"
good,The typical work day starts at 9 am by loading the packages in a well coordinated logistics operations. The delivery duties are supported by the latest technology and apps with a well coordinated support systems. A typical day is a 10 hour shift. The job is not for the faint hearted.
good,"This company provides good opportunities for its employees, but it comes at the cost of work-life balance and general quality of life. Even if you get used to the 10-hour days of physical labor and weeks of mandatory overtime, it is incredibly easy to lose your job over minor incidents."
good,"No flexibility or work/life balance. Lots of walking which is good for fitness but bad for most people's feet who aren't marathon runners. Pays well, low requirements and lots of time to one's self. Clear job description."
good,"The atmosphere was quite productive. There was a bell that rang for breaks and lunches and employees had to move quickly. The communication needs more work. The managers do not inform of any changes. There were only emails. Once emailed, there are no responses in the same area."
good,"Amazon as a business it is one of the best Enterprise in the world. They only need to improve their process and management. LIf you can work during 10/11 hours every shift, make high rates you can work on an Amazon Fulfillment. Due"
good,"I like having a flexible work schedule, however I don't like not knowing what time I'm going to get off. I do like the fact you have plenty of opportunity to more hours by picking up extra shifts."
good,The pay at amazon is decent but you rarely get any time off and its hard to get time off if an emergency arises. Its even harder to advance in the field.
good,"After the Holidays, you are lucky to get 20+ hours a week. Not a significant amount of income after robbing you of any Flexibility from November 15th thru January 1st each year."
good,Worked there for the holiday rush basically. Told during the hiring process that I had permanent job until I quit or did something to be fired. Got a chance to learn a lot of the warehouse duties and how they all work together to succeed. Was contacted via phone call that I was laid off.
good,Starting at 9 leaving house at half 7-8 getting home at half 7-8 at night so 12 hours shift really. Pay by day so finish early (HA) go home when finish. Bad traffic and other things can mess your day up. Ended up going home excaused every day
good,Production intensive qui a des conséquences sur la sécurité qui entraîne des douleurs corporelles
good,"The pay is great for the work, but there is no job security whatsoever.  They hire a lot of people for peak in November and December and have you work 60 hour weeks (mandatory).  They do offer a lot of paid time off and cheap health insurance."
good,I worked for retail as an Applied Scientist. Problems are pretty mundane and people seem to be locked into a really old mode of thinking of Data Science problems in the Industry. Hope this gets better.
good,"So far so good the job is easy for the most technical part, but is physically  demanding, there is no stopping not even for your brake that is supposed to be 15 min but you cant take more than 10 min because it reflects bad on your metrics, so far I like working there but after Christmas i feel very disappointed, the first company i have ever worked for that basically mentioned a whole bunch of perks for Christmas and did nothing at all. I mean nothing, not even a Christmas card or at least a coupon for something or a gift card or discount or incentive, Nothing at all for Christmas for anyone that I know. not even a Christmas party or dinner like most employers have."
good,"The job may seem easy but with the timing and amount they want in a certain time it is very difficult. Your job is not secure because there is a very high turn over rate. If you do not make the quota 3 times your job is gone. You are to stretch before work every work day but they don't sometimes and usually it is stretches in the same body area like arms and not legs or back. You are to get to work right after announcements and 'stretches'. You can stow, pull, or scan, but they usually have ambassadors do that or the same people. They don't rotate like they say they do. They usually struggle when the designated 3 scanners they always have are sick or quit. Stowing is hard because they is a competition for your job every day. No friendly competition. Pulling can be dangerous if you pull wrong and hurt your back, but they have you pulling for 8 rows so it pretty inevitable. You have a 15 minute break which is more like 5 because it take 5 minutes to get to break area and back. Lunch is 30 minutes and you mostly get that because time doesn't start until you clock out. This job is very strenuous and is not secure so I would suggest having this as 'ONLY' and part time or for extra money. This job did pay well and you only had a three day work week, though I used the other four days to recoup for next week. I did enjoy they Christmas Party and event though. I had won a 54"" TV. That was the best thing about Amazon for me."
good,"i worked in the outbound warehouse, this is where everything was shipped out, the working conditions were terrible during night shifts, boxes all over the floor, managers only present during emergencies, and very fellow employees were either lazy or rude"
good,"long work days, no windows, no personal phones, have to go through security.  heavy lifting,  bending and lots of walking and stairs.  the management is pretty good there are some great ones and some very bad ones."
good,"not a good place to work, never got any help from managers or fellow colleagues and were not accommodating for my medical needs at all. i would have seizures because i would get so stressed out"
good,"Some teams are terrible...with no support whatsoever. Some teams are outstanding but god help you if that manager gets transferred or leaves because then you can end up with any old nightmare. "
good,Needs a lot of improvement managements wise and salary wise there is some flexibility but it is not the best. After peak job securement isnt really there.
good,"No Work Life Balance and you will be really exhausted at the end of the life. Dont have a chair to sit for the entire shift. For Managers, shift eill be more than 15 hours most of the days"
good,"If you plan on working for this company be prepared to no longer have a life during peak seasons. Twice per year, summer and Christmas, you are expected to work 55-60 hours per week! Now the pay is great however moving up into another role or a different department is very tricky. It's more of a who you know than how well are you doing."
good,"Allows individuals to utilize their education by performing different types of projects, Kaizens, and PDCAs; however, turnover is high due employees not meeting min. expectations."
good,"Working at Amazon wasn’t hard for me physically, I’ve worked at plenty other places much more physically demanding (the railroad, an assembly line assembling transmissions, etc). And I’ve thrived at those kind of places. Amazon was hard for me mentally! To me it felt like a prison. All the coworkers clicked together like we’re back in high school, if you weren’t a day oner when the warehouse first opened, or close to it anyways, nobody would help you or talk to you. I could literally feel myself getting more and more depressed."
good,Working at Amazon as a delivery driver is a fast pace and busy position. There is a lot of steps and preparation before leaving for your route. The routes are typically 150 packages or more in a day. Work days are usually 8-10 hour days.
good,"Amazon is an enjoyable place to work short term.  The people I worked with were hardworking, supportive and fun. "
good,"Bonjour, j'ai effectué 9 mois en tant que préparateur de commande sur le site Amazon ORY1 (Orléans), voici ce que j'en retiens :"
good,I have worked for amazon for a little over 1 year and while I like Amazon as a company the management staff leaves a lot to be desired. I have had 3 different managers in my time with amazon and the first two were ok though the first was very inexperienced. The third manager however is the worst he is disrespectful he harasses associates he doesn't like it has created a very unhappy and very hostile working environment and while I have spoken with the HR department as well as his supervisor very little has been done about these issues.
good,Also im kompletten ist das für jeden der gerne im Lager arbeiten will sehr gut aber für leite die das nicht wollen ist das nichts
good,Benefits and pay are immaculate compared to most warehouse jobs and jobs in general. Work/life balance is minimal and overtime is sometimes unnecessary. Takes away from family life especially for people who have a spouse and kids
good,"I did have support from management.  "
good,Hard to get a job in Amazon but once you're in - you'll have your chances to grow but should enough support from the leadership team. Salary hikes n given income is very low
good,"Great for seasonal, but not for long term.  Management is overworked and underappreciated leading to a disorganized work atmosphere.  Best to just do your time, and collect your paycheck.  Standing out because of work ethic doesn't really get you far.  You need to hit the numbers to advance and that is it."
good,"Easy job if you know how to work and you're not a slacker! I was working there and UPS at the same time. UPS is sooo much more physical. People at Amazon would complain about the work and I would tell them to come work with me at UPS.  Compared to UPS, Amazon is easy!!!!"
good,"Leichte Arbeit allerdings monoton, das geht auf die Psyche"
good,I’m a 33 year old hard working male from Newark. I worked  at Amazon for 2 years I have experience in logistics also. I would come in to work completed a yard audit. And either drive the hostler trucks or work in the guard shack checking in and out trucks.
good,"As a returning employee a lot has changed since I started at a new location."
good,"If you enjoy constant work and are competitive then amazon would be a great place to work. I for one enjoyed it. It wasn't difficult, but there is a quota you are supposed to make and if you aren't making it you will be talked to about it. Usually a manager would come and try to hurry us up if we weren't making our quota for the hour."
good,Alot of walking is involved tho the *target System* can be a bit unfair as some people get alot of items in a close proximity to them while others need to walk 5min from item too item yet you still get judged the same.
good,"Lack of team work  a lot of the time, poor management, lazy young and old  workers. Need better climate control; either freezing or burning up in there."
good,"Ambiente dinamico ,ritmi elevati ambiente amichevole"
good,Couldn’t work there and go to college. Very stressful long hours on my feet all night. They always called mandatory overtime and I also had to go to school very hard to balance the two so I had to leave. Education is more important!
good,Amazon could do way better in my opinion .The breaks need to longer or at least make sure everyone has a locker for when they come in to work their shifts.
good,there are no benefits if u r part time . even for work related injury u dont get time off u have to wait for vto to open or just work and suffer thru ur shift
good,"I enjoyed the days of celebrating holidays, the military, and the games that management would invent for all employees to enjoy, These situations allowed all to interact with one another while breaking up the day,"
good,"Pay is good, work isn’t real hard but favoritism with management and employees make it difficult regardless of well you do your job. Management doesn’t appreciate all employees"
good,Run. Don’t pass go. Keep job searching. HR are not friendly. They treat the associates as if the associates are wasting their (HR’s) time. I would absolutely not recommend Amazon to any serious job seeker.
good,Production should be high to maintain integrity of company. high interaction of people so important to use communication skills. will have a great experience long as you work hard.
good,It was ok working there. Nice people that worked there and the lunches were ok they sometimes had surprise party’s and stuff for the employees that were decent
good,"The only positive thing to come out of my time in amazon is the friends i made.. really nice people working there but management do everything they can to ruin that."
good,They make u work like ur a robot they dont care about there employees hr trys to scare you like your doing something wrong every min and every second is a constant gogogogo people die working here also on the job its just sad n u will never have time for what really matters most your family
good,"A typical day was 10 hours of packing boxes, although this was just one of the many roles on offer. The management worked you hard, but were ultimately fair and reasonable. V. good wage rates and a good team culture"
good,"Working here comes with some perks but they do not outweigh the demands and expectations that are expected from you every day. You will get compulsory overtime at short notice which could be coming in an hour earlier, when the buses aren't running, and/or coming in on one of your days off for a 5th 10 and a 1/2 - 11 and a 1/2 hour shift that week. 15 minutes of not being able to scan an item has to be justified to your manager. You can be moved to different departments daily without choice and whether you've had training or not."
good,Amazon is good if your starting out with no experience in IT but if you have some its not a good start as the basic job function are not for intermediate or advanced skills. The Pay is also really really low and the work life balance is horrible.
good,Your standing on your feet for 8 - 12 hours a day. They play music which makes the time go by fast. Most of the managers aren't very friendly! They stand around watching you work! They don'y work as a team and when you need help (some) management acts as if your bothering them!
good,"No work/life balance, so be ready to give the job all you have. Perfect for mid-twenties who are looking for valuable experience with the time and energy it takes to excel there."
good,"So much focus is spent on meeting customer needs that Amazon fails to meet employee needs, on a basic level. Company culture suffers when ignorance runs rampant within leadership!"
good,travail facile a mettre en oeuvre  mais mal organisait ce qui cause des problèmes de productivités inexistant .
good,it an ok job to at least get on your feet and start saving to achieve your goal that you planned out. just keep your guards up at all times because you will never know what gonna happen.
good,Nothing to say if injured your screwed and need to get out asap! They will not put you in a position that suits your injuries instead you get screwed over
good,"I have been very lucky to have been able to have such great flexibility with my hours.  Amazon delivery warehouse is very fast pace and physical work is not for everyone, I enjoy working hard."
good,Too many people in a small warehouse   Management not on the same page with each other  Does not communicate changes very well with them  Employees Can never get the same answer from anybody
good,The group of employees were good and there were a few Managers that listened to then encouraged you by finding a solution.  The hardest part was facing and overcoming obstacles from machinery and management.
good,It's my first job in England. For the first time - not bad. Competitive salary but you must work very hard to earn it. I had night shift: it was difficult to adopt.
good,"Being in management at an Amazon facility already requires you to take multitasking to a whole new level. Anything can malfunction at anytime so you also need to be prepared to adjust your plan for the day frequently. The job itself was actually fun, the managers above me made it high stress. Management at Amazon are full of new and young faces still learning how to manage well and most don't do well. Also, good luck getting time for lunch, its usually frowned upon to step away to eat."
good,I was a picker at a Amazon Warehouse. It is a extremely fast paced environment. I was terminated because I did not meet their expectations. Tsk time which should be 7 but mine was around 12. If you do not meet their rate expectations you will be terminated. You will get tired and feel soar  because their is a lot of moving around. This job is pressuring. I do not recommend this job for everyone.
good,"I liked the fact that you were kept busy sorting, organizing and loading packages for individual delivery teams. I never knew my boss or manager on any given day. I felt the management at this location was never helpful and I never knew who was in charge."
good,"Physically demanding job, rigid corporate policy make for a very tiring work environment.  Amazon staffs at about 70% of the actual number of employees they need to comfortably do the work.  Then they hound the employees about keeping the rate of work up. Exeryone must meet quota, even though Amazon doesn't call it a quota"
good,Not a career especially if you have a family. Way too much work if you are salary and if you aren't salary you're not making very much. Not a great place to work and if you're on the bottom of the totem pole job security is a joke.
good,"Working for AmazonFresh is just okay. I was full-time for awhile until schedule changes made me change to part-time. If you are looking to make a few bucks a week then working part-time is a good option. As a part-time employee I am paid weekly, unlike my full-time counterparts who get paid biweekly. Part-timers don't get raises, so you will only get the standard $15/hour. The job isn't too stressful but working the fridge or the freezer section for long periods of time can be taxing if you're not use to it. Moving up here is almost impossible. There aren't many higher positions available and when there is the pay is only a dollar more than your current pay. And those positions are only meant for full-time employees. "
good,"Lots of overtime during the holidays with giveaways for working extra hours. Little to no hours out of holiday season. Some of the managers and leads were good, some of them were in positions that they didn't belong in."
good,Amazon is a very stressful job. They are really strict on making rate & not making too many errors. It very hard on the body and mind. You really have to concentrate while working because it very easy to make errors if you are paying attention to what it is you're doing.
good,"Company is only concerned with making "
good,Why am I being forced to submit a review? Whatever. Excessive overtime long hours working all holidays physically draining and thankless not an enjoyable job
good,"This is a warehouse job. It's hard, and the employees here are pretty rugged because of it. Keep in mind there is no interview process for this job either, so you are working with every kind of person. You will go home aching and sore daily after your 10+hr shifts. You more than likely will change management at least once a year and your co-workers are consistently moving around whether from transferring or termination, both of which are extremely likely."
good,"The Managment team do not speak to one another, the associates are left in the dark when potentially have to stay late you are never told in advance or at all."
good,"If you don’t know how to swim through dirty politics, this is not a place for you."
good,"Good benefits,   Amazon don’t have good management.  The PAs are not good either... The work will tear down your body!!!  The work hours are very good."
good,"I think Amazon could take some more feedback from their workers. Picking could have been a lot easier if they organized the pick locations better, and if you're going to have them do production then they should get paid for production."
good,"Amazon is famous for relentlessly extracting maximal efficiency/cost-savings from their suppliers and employees.  "
good,"Amazon is a great place to work if you have nowhere else to turn to. Averaging about 2500-2700 dollars a month, the pay is not sustainable for families. Maybe for a single person living on their own with roommates. The management is okay. The work is simple, but labor extensive, and the pay is below par. If you have other options, check them out first."
good,"Not a fun place to work, a real grind...  The management rules through fear and you are on call 24/7/365 with a need for full internet availability at all times."
good,Amazon is actually a great job. They have a lot of messy people. The feel like they can’t be touched because they are permanent. This is the one on Gold Pike in Fort Worth Texas.
good,It was both good and bad experience.  You can learn a lot about various products of Amazon and it's classifications but there are no skill improvement programmes.
good,Good job for young people trying to get by. Quotas are strictly enforced and job security is slim. Wouldn't recommend unless you try to move up into management.
good,Not great if you plan to move up because there is not much opportunity to do so. That plus favoritism. I recommend you get out as soon as you are able to.
good,"They promise 4 hours of work hours, they have cut us to 3 hours. If we work for hours per day, they would pay us for 20 hours per work. I cant survivor on 3 hours per day."
good,Work there was definitely not for everyone. Productivity is a major role in every job there. Overtime is mandatory during certain times of the year and when it's slow you can be sent home.
good,"Amazon went above and beyond during the Harvey Hurricane disaster."
good,"This job is great for someone who just wants to go to work, do their job, then go home. If there is ever (VET) voluntary extra time then jump on it because it is rare and the money is worth it."
good,Buen ambiente. Mucho control sobre el tiempo utilizado. Despidos y suspensiones no justificadas.
good,"Amazon is very competitive, fast paced and stressful, Depending on your position it can be more stressful than others and due to working the night shift I don't get enough sleep and often wake up late during the day which means I can't make plans before my work schedule. Due to my site being a high achieved building, production goals are increased to continue to be the top building which means employee rates go up and have to work much harder. It's not for the feint hearted."
good,"Mostly a lot of kids, cliques and high school politics. The work is easy during the day shift but graveyard/night sort, they work the f* out of you. Managements’ job duties are to sit and watch, delegate, and announce breaks/lunches."
good,"Amazon has good things and bad things, life and work balance is very hard with the amount of hours you work per day. Sometimes you can work from 12-14 hour days. The benefits with the company are good and you get to learn a lot of new things."
good,Fast-paced is an understatement. Quotas are the measurement of your value. If you can't keep up you are gone. The work just breaks down your body and a basic employee doesn't have much chance for advancement. If you want a better job at Amazon go back to school and get a technology degree.
good,"Overall, probably a great place to work."
good,"Idk about the other departments, I was in picking and they are an okay company, its very competitive, its very repetitive, it does get boring, they have a point system."
good,"L'ambiance peut être bonne , beaucoup de bonne rencontre "
good,"yes it was ok to work for amozon but it was poorly run and very little training no canteen and short tea breaks picking times where always"
good,"As amazon says they are very customer obsessed. in order to give the lowest prices to the customer they must do everything else cheaply to send the savings to their customer base. genius for business, hard on employees."
good,"Short breaks , if you don't mind standing on your feet all day apply ! You can get fired at any time so your job is not secured at all. Have to do things timed or that is a warning/ write up."
good,"You barely work any hours, not recognized, and always have to be better even when you are always giving your best. The people were cool, but I was often stuck in trucks with workers who had no idea what they were doing and was stuck unloading a truck by myself with 80lb packages constantly."
good,"Good place to work if you’re not afraid of heights and long hrs. Very busy during Thanksgiving and Christmas Holiday seasons, it is mandatory overtime during those weeks."
good,"You need to work hard, get sleep and stay hydrated. Amazon can be tough, especially if you work at night. The Benefits are the best I’ve ever seen.. Don’t expect a raise for years $15.00 an hour is top pay for beginners. The stocks are gone as well as the monthly bonuses. 😔 Amazon has a strange culture. Hard to explain you’l see it from Day 1!!"
good,"It didn't pay much and it had difficult work hours with minimal days off."
good,"Great first job but very little growth n high turnover rate. Cold wear warm clothes ,they push for high pick rate n safety ,but it's more just pick rate than anything."
good,"Amazon values the dogma of their leadership principles rather than focusing on building and actual culture. This means that your direct leaders are far more important to your success than any individual company program, and their goals are not usually aligned to yours. Despite this, you'll learn a lot here no matter your role."
good,"It's only a part time job but it takes everything out of you physically. They have set unrealistic standards, causing people to push themselves harder than is healthy to."
good,"Amazon is a company that thrives on customer service, and will do everything to provide excellent customer service. However there is a lack of opportunities to progress in the company, and those that are able to progress to higher positions are those of a ""superior"" race. There is still favoritism in the company. The salary is really good for a place where minimal experience is needed, but it is a really draining job, and new skills are constantly being added to those you already have, albeit with no remuneration for them. The people really make the place, and without them the company would really suffer."
good,"It’s good pay.hours are long,especially if you have children.during peak season they work you like a Slave..you work 12 hour shift 5-6 days a week.peak season is the worst."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work at as long as you are willing to always be on a grindstone constantly. Upper management makes priorities and sets them, but the biggest factor is when you go from one location to another and the rules can change from a little to a lot.  You have to always protect yourself and you also have to always back up yourself too. There are some good managers and I will say they are some of the nicest ones I have had. I think the biggest thing that would make this company greater is if upper management will listen to the techs who do the work on a day to day basis and give them the tools they need and give them the ability to make some good strives and not have to be under pressure all the time. If there is not pressure then people can get work done."
good,Amazon is a good place to work depending on your manager. If they have good intentions for you personally or not.My job was really good at first but then I switched shifts and things went a little bit left.
good,"J ai effectuer plusieurs mission intérimaire pour cette société,  gros service de sécurité u poil trop suspucieuse.  Pause avec café offert.  Rythme infernal mais avec règles de sécurité  plutôt bien ficeler."
good,"Mi piaceva il lavoro ma non l'ambiente,troppo stressante sempre lì i cadetti a vedere quanto producevi sempre lì con gli occhi addosso peggio dei carcerati"
good,Purtroppo in Amazon danno troppo spazio a stranieri invece di favorire tutti anche noi Italiiani dobbiamo integrarci nel mondo del lavoro siamo tutti uguali quando si mangia o ce da pagare bollette contratti indeterminato soprattutto a stranieri italiani tre mesi e tutti a casa   allora andassero a costruire lo stabilimento li
good,"I’m a delivery driver and it’s entirely too much work. You have to load your own van in the mornings and mind you; you have to drive 15 min to offsite ( park your car and pick up your van) . Slave in the heat or cold plus bad weather and still have to deliver every package no matter what. If it’s flooding you have to detour; it’s no going back into the warehouse with your packages. Rain, sleet, snow, or hail you must deliver every package. It’s unsafe, they inly care about getting every package-delivered."
good,"You're on your feet all day, very fast paced. Management was okay, has room for improvement. Hardest part of the job was not getting enough breaks especially with no A/C in the building. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know co-workers."
good,Ok company to work for but their sick policy is horrendous. Multiple injuries at work and you still get penalised as they don't handle work injuries separately. Pay is ok. Management is bad they only care about progression for themselves which demoralises workers. Ok
good,Good part time job. Amazon flex app is very helpful. You are a contractor not actually an employee. They care about their customers. The staff is very supportive and thankful for your service.
good,A typical day at work was starting at 6 in the morning and getting off at 4 in the afternoon. A typical 10 hour day. There were times that we had to do mandatory overtime during peak season. My manager was great! I enjoyed working in the Made on Demand department. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep the rate up for the particular positions. The most enjoyable was the coworkers.
good,"I was a Christmas temp. I never knew who was in charge and what days I worked, people were fired randomly. Hard work wasn't rewarded, a lot of people slacked off. Arranged public transport sometimes didn't even turn up! Completely unorganized. They get their agencies to do the dirty work for them!"
good,"Pretty okay, work is okay too there isnt much to go on about this job. work balance is pretty okay soo, meaning life and schedule wise, schedule drop pick."
good,"This my first job and it gave me some skills some of the skills would be scanning bags, giving Packages to the driver's and when things are almost complete me and other employees would look around if there is nothing else"
good,Lack of structure throughout the company. Too many changes without proper training and adequate time for changes. Hours changing makes for harder scheduling for work-life balance.
good,They do not take experience into consideration on pay. Promotions only happen if you know the right people has nothing to do with your work ethic. The favoritism that is played makes it hard to want to work there.
good,"Es un trabajo dinámico, en el que tienes que cumplir con unas producciones. Eso hace que sea un trabajo entretenido, el problema es la mala gestión de los encargados, que fomentan que haya una rivalidad entre los trabajadores, por lo que las mejores producciones a veces las consigue el más ""tramposo"" y no el mejor compañero. Eso hace que a veces el clima laboral sea tenso."
good,Okay to work there to get on your feet if that’s what you’re looking for otherwise it might be for you they will work you hard until you’re tired and exhausted you will work four 10hr shifts with 2days off to sleep
good,You are required to meet a certain quota and a lot of people do not usually meet it. The people that you meet there are very upbeat and the want to work and do. A lot of the people are very helpful with what they know. Since I train people I am able to meet a lot of the people that work there and I get to see different cultures.
good,If you want easy money this is the job for you.  Scan a item put it in a bin .10 hrs a shift. 4 days a week.  If you are lucky to receive small items ( happy days) your rate will go up easier. If less unlucky you have larger items your rate will go down because you have no where to store them. You have to find a good mix. However alot of cherry picking goes on . From the down stacker to the cart runner and to you . Only if your from a certain minority .If not sometimes you will struggle.
good,Amazon is a nice place to work I enjoyed going to work. I don't think that I was giving a fair chance to prove myself that I can perform the job in a timely and efficient manner.
good,"I enjoy the level of freedom I was allowed. Work-life balance is respected. It really helps to be a self-starter - once you show that you have skills you are keen to leverage, they capitalize on those skills."
good,You are able to set your own schedule and work freely but your job is not guaranteed. If you Apply for a block you cannot miss it. You must try and deliver every package given or you can get marked
good,Just have flexibility and be able to drive under all weather conditions and drive to multiple city's and make over a 100 stops and deliver up to 200 packages
good,Everything about the place is based off of data. Strict place. 2 15 minute breaks that are actually 9 minute breaks because of the walking to and from.
good,"I was hired through a third party company and the hours were not as consist as the amazon original workers. I enjoyed the routes we had but sometimes start at 9:30am, or 10:00am, evening 12 noon!. I didn't like the scheduling and hours for the company."
good,"Low salary compare to effort produced, promotion based on connection not compétences, say safety first but mean productivity at all risk, time of task introduce to make make you work without going to washroom for instance,"
good,"I worked in the Pune office- given that its a small branch now the poltics and balance mechanisms are very bad. Where as I know for a matter  of fact that its not as bad in other locations like HYD, BGL etc. End of the day Amazon is all but the team you re going to be a part of."
good,"High turnover of workers in the warehouse positions.  Hard work is a requirement and is tracked (ie: pick rate per hour).  Great place to work while you look for a job.  Better than minimum wage to start with great benefits starting the first day. Most big perks kick in after 2yrs (like stocks and matching RRSP).  4 day work week with 10hr shifts.  Lots of training and various job options available.  Hard to advance unless you ""know someone"" or meet the managers requirements.  Tenure, education or experience may not get you a promotion. Long hours and extra days required during busy seasons (Xmas and ""Prime Week"" in July).  Vacation and ""sick days"" (PTO-personal time off) available. LOTS of rules including attendance and safety. Workshoes paid and vest/gloves etc. provided.  Lunchroom with vending machines and microwaves.  Typical warehouse environment. Training on forklift/order picker power trucks.  Managers may not have training or experience for managing people so work can get frustrating and rules seem excessive (and sometimes strange).  Pay is low for experienced forklift drivers compared to other companies. Little or no interview for basic warehouse worker (over 18yrs old, read/write English, stand/walk for 10hr shift, lift 45lbs).  Some part-time positions available during busy seasons. Secure location=no cellphones or cameras."
good,"long hard work days with little actual down time during the work day   "
good,"The management are absolutely rubbish and favouritism exists. A persons skill is not taken into account for any job with them. If they like the look of you then you will go far."
good,"The pros are - you're surrounded by talented, inspiring people - the best of the best. Cool perks and events. You get paid well and there's a decent benefits package. The buildings are cool and it's fun to work in them - everything is state-of-the-art. The cons are - you're always working, even if you're on sick leave, vacation, or PTO. You must respond to calls and emails immediately, regardless of how trivial the matter is. Many managers have subject-matter expertise, but no management or leadership skills. It's a good job until you burn out. Generally, people who maintain personal boundaries and care about their mental health wouldn't stay there any longer than they have to."
good,The company is decent and it's growing rapidly but their management lacks alot. They don't treat their associates fair and they show little to no respect. I'm currently still here but will soon report it to HR because there are some horrendous low standard individuals at their middle management positions. They definitely lack leadership skills. They need to learn how to treat their associates. Overall if management was better it would be an awesome place to work.
good,"I thought I would love working at Amazon boy was I wrong the building is huge and you have to use over half your break to get to and from break room , they never compliment you only negative feedback and write ups, they have a lot of injuries and they expect it , management is not experienced lots of young kids standing around with laptops watching us work but never helping I was very disappointed with this company."
good,"Cold in the winter, hot in the summer... no heat or a/c."
good,The job environment is fair but theres not much room to advance . They dont care about people as much as they say they do. The permanent employees are treated better.
good,I made good money but I definitely worked for it. Management would rotate every 6 months so it was difficult to get to know them and move up to other departments. My co-workers were great and the pay was nice for a college student if you're willing to give up your weekends. People say bad things about this company but Amazon is a company where you get what you put into it.
good,"Package ,picking ,storage, hand over ,"
good,"somedays it was a great work environment  and other days because of the way the shift was structure it was stressful, however, I did like the benefit."
good,If you want a career that you can start at the bottom and work up this isn't for you.  Internal hire management is under paid EVERY time but they do provide a great work environment for their employees.  Management generally appreciates the associates.
good,You clock in at 6:00 pm. and you clock out for lunch for a half of an hour then you clock back in after your lunch break.  You get two 15 minute breaks that you are not required to clock out or in.  You work the entire time you are on the clock less the breaks that are allowed.  I learned something new and management was not the greatest.  The work culture was okay but needed improvement and the hardest part of the job was productivity because they were not attainable goals.  The most enjoyable part of the job was before you were required to clock in.
good,Amazon has far too high of a performance standard expected out of their workers. Puts a lot of stress onto the employees with very little effort or sign of improvement
good,"It is an environment that you have to stay aware in because of the pace that you have to work while bring there. The hardest part about working there is that when you know that you will end up being late because of traffic or any other reason, there is no one to call to inform so that you do not get penalized for it. The most enjoyable part about working at Amazon is how friendly and engaging the environment is. They always make sure you warm up before you start and are able to enjoy yourself while working."
good,More hrs need to be added  We scan packages built palettes but I think while and just a part time job I should become a full time job. And I think when you get Hired on you should Immediately be a blue batch like everybody else.
good,i wouldn't recommend a job at amazon because the people are just rude and horrible the only thing that was as i expected was the work i was doing this is just my opinion.
good,Job gets repetitive and Managers are always changing. Employees are always leaving. The hardest part about the job is that they don't consider workers customers. You really don't get good benefits and you just get minimum wage. It is just a job.
good,"on aurait pu avoir un salaire plus élevé par rapport à la difficulté et la charge de travail sous une cadence assez soutenu qui se révèle très physique."
good,"All the bad things you've heard are true. At the same time all the good things you've heard are true as well. If you work for corporate, it is an entirely different experience from what goes on in the FC."
good,They need more organized the supervisor never had a direct answer each day was a new adventure.  I would like to return some day. Thank you for the opportunity
good,Ok starting job for someone with no skills. Not to much thinking required. Mundane tasks repeated daily.  Hard to move up once you start and or convert from temp/seasonal to full time employee. No benefits for part time.
good,"They don't offer much employment or advancements. Breaks are short and isually spend more time going and coming back rather than relax. "
good,Amazon likes to move managers around frequently and plans lack consistency.  Training programs are generic and not aimed at specific to certain jobs. Job classifications can be changed without any input from employees.
good,Harassing of employees / Cursing at your employees / constant injuries / HR getting angry at you cuz you have an injury / not compensating people for using their personal insurance to cover injuries that occurred at Amazon / Too many bad behaviors / No paid sick time/  too many to name/ good luck/
good,"on phone all day talking to consumers and their accounts or orders"
good,liked the folks I worked with for the most part.and you must be joking about the length of this review. it can't be that important to anyone who might read this because it's not the absolute worst job in the world
good,It's very fast pace work environment. Most people are friendly and fun to have conversations with. They give helpful constructive criticism. Over all good work experience.
good,"work was hard, managers act superior to the employees actually doing work. no tolerance for anything out of their control. changing management every 6 months."
good,If you are looking for hard work and doing the same thing for 10plus hour straight with changing this is the job for u they make they own rules for different plants one can do what another cannot.
good,"it was okay for what it was at the time. good job for kids going to school. The full time gets stressful, especially for older associates. Most jobs are very fast paced."
good,it was very interesting place to work.  i think if you needed a part time postion it was ok. they are interesting people to work with. i think that people there are easy to work with as well.
good,You are on your feet for 10 hours a day. Expected to work at a fast rate even when tired or sick. You hardly see people and you are by yourself most of the time. You are put on a work rate so that you keep your work up.
good,"There is no place that I have worked at that is as challenging and demanding than at Amazon. Leadership has good intentions of managing with emotional IQ, but at the end of the day results have to be delivered."
good,"If you can solve problems they move you around to solve all kind of problem. They rank the people who did not move and just auditing over you if they friends say that they are great workers. "
good,Each place is different from what I heard. So it depends on where you go. I heard that some places offer more hours so you might want to look into those places if you have a car and willing to travel.
good,It’s fun at first getting to work with all the technology (robots) but your managers push employees past their limits until you get injured on the job.  The preach safety and productivity and quality all day to workers but won’t take responsibility when someone gets hurt. The hardest part of the job is hitting the high numbers managers want to push on you and being stuck in a building where you can barely see the outside it gets depressing really quick. The most enjoyable part is meeting and working with different people .
good,A typical day at work was come in at 6 and go 100% until the end of shift to ensure you met the process rate. Overall I enjoyed working at amazon but there want great communication between managers and employees.
good,"A typical day of work consists of an extreme amount of walking and depending on your job, a lot of lifting and physical labor.  The hours are not conducive to having a social life but the benefits that are provided are excellent."
good,Amazon was one of the hardest jobs I have ever had. It was extremely hands on and was a very fast pace for me. I genuinely loved the pay but really disliked the job.
good,I like working there they just dont make it easy to move up unless you are s favorite it seems they dont want the hard workers to advance just the slackers
good,"Une équipe disponible, dynamique, des heures de travail correctes, culture et intégration dans l'entreprise très importante, le plus difficile arrivé au terme d'un contrat qui n'est pas renouvelé et ne pas avoir la possibilité de débriefer sur la mission... on reste dans le flou avec les entreprises d'interim. Dommage."
good,"The work is easy, but the expectations are very high. The rate has to be 100% or above, however, there is some exceptions. Also, 10 hour shifts can be exhausting. At times, it will feel as though you're a robot."
good,"Pays good but very high stress. Lots of opportunity to move around with company and competitive pay rates, especially for tenured associates. Very negative culture, more focused on productivity than associate well being."
good,although the pay is good the hours are never adequate one week i could have 3 shifts and the next none also some weeks the pay is messed up and takes another week or two to be repaid. Only go for this job if you are looking for temporary work it is very labour-some and hard work not many people can cope with this job for more than 1 month i have worked here for nearly 6 now and i have seen many people come and go due to messed up pay
good,"typical day would always be stressful just because of poor management. lazy workers get easy routes and places in the warehouse and those who work hard would have to work even harder. From this job i learned a lot about inequality and how NOT to manage a warehouse. management is very poor due to the racism and putting your country people above others, besides that, workplace culture is quite fascinating, everyone is very friendly and talkative (there even are some arcades in the canteen). the hardest part would be not going insane of the amount of work you have to do per night shift but it was enjoyable sometimes to be the best in the warehouse."
good,The place has good money over the time of Christmas and then they start laying off people. Specially the rugeley FC don't respect the staff. Agencies are not very supportive and helpful. The place and the facilities are amazing but the Amazon should work improving the management and favoutrism. The manager support there own people and ignoring the performances of good staff. Agencies never give the support which staff need and even don't do there work on time and properly. Amazon should have check and balance on agency as well as take there performance in account. Overall it's good place to work provided that everybody should treat the same way like no difference in agency staff and permanent staff. Agency people work hard just they want to retain their job and some of permanent staff enjoy and don't do there job but get away with it.
good,"The workplace is very competitive, I saw many people get fired for not being able to keep up. The hardest part of the job is having to work 10 hours a day."
good,"Amazon will pay an external 110-130k for an operations manager job. if you were an area manager that moved into that role, you will get paid 75-80k..You are expendable if you are an internal promotion. They do not value upward mobility. My advice to you is to come in with your desired salary and add 10% for future promotions because that is all you will get. They also use to give you stock for promotions, now you get nothing. All internals are quitting because the gap in pay for paying an external for the SAME exact job is way too high. shame on Amazon. I actually wanted to stay but each year I stay, I'm literally losing salary another company would be glad to pay me.."
good,"very competitive workplace, lots of politics, usually employees thrive or leave quickly, Amazon does reward top performers well but also tries very hard to push out lower performers."
good,"I applied to work part-time but work closer to full-time hours.  Hours extremely inconsistent, schedule 3 weeks in advance, unpaid time off offered but once gone then the options to take off were limited."
good,Great Pay for what the job entailed but job doesn't have good work life balance like to change schedules a lot and doesn't like to listen to employees about what can be better or what would help make the job better.
good,I personally hate Amazon since I've worked there they don't care about the employees the money is fine but the way things are done is terrible. The hours make me not wanna go back we can't enjoy breaks and we get penalized for things we don't have control of.
good,So the pay is pretty good but it’s a hard job it’s very active and your constantly being monitored you have very strict timings and targets to have to stick by
good,C’etait Sympa à travailler il y avait une bonne ambiance de groupe’ ou tout le monde s’entendait et s’entraider super bien
good,"At this company what I used to do was counting objects inside a bin, Making sure that the amount was correct, inspecting for damages.  it was fast and fun"
good,"amazon bases their techs abilities on a set of standard questions, never are you asked about experience or even technical questions. if you don't answer the questions how THEY want them answered, then your chances of promoting are thin to none."
good,"Relatively new warehouse, causing there not to be poorly organized, specially the training. Since they needed to train large amounts of classes they would rush through the material, not covering everything and if in the future you made a mistake there was no leniency, even if it was your first week, they would hand out write-ups like candy so management could cover themselves."
good,you have to meet a scan quota. The workday it self is only 4 hours. They have a few arcade games you could play if you have the time. I have nothing more to say on this job
good,"while I really enjoyed the people at the call center, the work life balance for management was terrible.  Certain site directors had their own agenda and imposed that on the management team."
good,on a typical day i would be on the inbound dock receiving palletised goods and loading stock on to conveyer track wich will be distributed around warehouse. It is a cross-docked warehouse the target is 24hours from receiving goods in too on a wagon again out of the building.
good,"Amazon is not employee centric, Management issues , they dont understand problems a employer can have when they need leave."
good,"The pay is good but, not consistent.  Hard to get runs sometimes, customer service could be better when you call about a issue when you out on a run. You have to be able to problem solve on your own."
good,"This is a good job for a single person in their 20s with no other restrictions on their time and a healthy body. There is only 2 weeks to come up to speed quotas, and then disciplinary action begins. Once you are in a hole regarding quotas, it's almost impossible to get back, and Amazon churns employees in and out so often, there's very little discretion given to supervisors, and very little investment from HR. WARNING: If you are terminated for missing quotas, you can never work for Amazon again IN ANY CAPACITY."
good,"Amazon offer a lot of time paid off and also there are good programs for associates to help to grow up so you can move up to leadership position."
good,"Not much room for utilizing acquired skills and degrees. Amazon has standards but consistency is key. If they would interview people instead of accepting any and every body they would have fewer workers but they would have a workforce that is effective , diligent, efficient, hard working, high working standards, and positive attitudes."
good,Long hours and alot of work but if you are willing to work hard and during the holidays work a large amount of overtime then this is a good position to look into
good,"Barely any hours, repetitive shifts, only time you can get any hours is during peak(holidays) after that you get a maximum of 3 hours a day which isn't good if you have bills."
good,"nice place to work for short period.However as you grow older in this organization only the work responsibility and work load will grow but salary will never grow for any reason."
good,Ambiente lavorativo molto impegnativo con i colleghi
good,"No one, and I mean no one manages at PIT5,"
good,"I don't feel they rewarded me for my talent. I spent 30 years in the Navy serving my country.  I advanced to rank of E9 Command Master Chief.   I managed over 1,500 Sailors, Marines and Civilians at a larger Naval Air Station. I managed a Navy Distribution Center.  I taught high school, worked at Bell Helicopter in Supply Chain as a Senior Supply Management Specialist.   I had a Bachelor Degree in Business Administration.  I was hired in as a Associate.   I had expectations of my talent I would get a Senior Ops Manager position.  All my managers felt I probably should have been hired in as  a Senior Ops Mgr.  I was told they needed my leadership to groom the Associates but only wanted to keep me at a Tier 1."
good,"Each day you would get stopped on by the sellers and you felt lost.  Most times the sellers would inform you of the changes and policy updates, so then you would have to scramble to conjure a falsehood until you were able to finalize the call and find the correct answer.  "
good,"Growing pains, their solution. Assign unskilled labors to take on huge volume demand. Large turnover, many injuries and low moral. No win for employee"
good,Drains your energy . Workers gossip all day and slack. People dont want to help train the new starters. Transportation and available parking sucked. Its just not worth it unless you like ware house work
good,Keeping rate is hard on your body for as many hours as they are wanting you to work during peak season for the amount they paid when I worked there which was less than $13.
good,Demanding job that required alot of walking and took away walking time in all of the breaks. Besides the breaks being cut down to a fraction of the time the work was okay
good,it was a past paced environment that was fun and friendly. but rate was a little much and almost impossible to maintain. the coaches were hounding and annoying.
good,"Sucks Life out of you. Hunger Games for Software Developers."
good,I loved working for Amazon it was a wonderful opportunity and job to work for even tho it was a short period . Need to work on management staff with there communication to staff
good,"I worked at Amazon full-time for a year, third shift.  It is a temporary job for most people.  It is a very fast paced job.  Every position must meet the expected rate.  If you don't then you will eventually be let go.  It can be a fun work environment except during peak season which is a nightmare.  The reason I left was because of the mandatory over time.  You are expected to work about 50 hours per week regularly throughout the year and up to 60 hours during peak.  On the plus side, they provide exceptional benefits which start on day 1."
good,The benefits and time is very good the pay now stops at 17.45 but they took stocks and VCP the work tears your body down slowly but surely if you move up they under pay you compared to someone that never worked there if you break one policy they will fire you instantly without a warning or write up no matter how many years of hard work you put in everything is about rate it's no use to do an appeal cause they ask the board 2 questions in which they have to say yes or no and 99% of the time the answer is yes no negotiating at all they treat managers on up as Gods with pay they never drug test managers or HR and which most of them smoke they dont care about your outside life only time you can have a phone is if someone is on their death bed but its still up to HR to say yes and if it's no then you'll never know if someone died and during peak they work you like a dog dont care what you already have planned whether its doctor appts. or things you been had planned if you dont have paid or unpaid time to cover you might as well start looking for another job because you're FIRED🗣🗣🗣
good,"Management is not the best, no help in trying to move up in company. Great company to work for but pay is not livable. Benefits are awesome, working 4 days a week is nice. Depending on shift and manager, it could be a great place to work."
good,"La empresa tiene buena cultura corporativa pero es desorganizada a la hora de expandirse y proveer puestos con ""scope"" mas definido definido. El programa de ""rewards"" para empleados productivos es mediocre y mal estructurado."
good,"No work life balance in fulfillment "
good,If you are employed in an Amazon warehouse avoid injury at all cost. Amazon doesn't care about you and your health plus dealing with lack of communication between a whole bunch of third parties.
good,"You MUST be ok with fast paced physical labor work, if you are not okay with this then do not bother, especially during peak season! You MUST also be ok with being pushed to do your job."
good,Good place to work at but you either need to be pretty or have connections to get promotions. Alot of the managers are perverts and there is no proper management
good,"You have a lot of work here and you will enjoy it but sometimes there will be a lot of pressure."
good,"They will work you to the bone. If you're caught even taking a 30 second breather from the strenuous work, you will be punished for doing so."
good,"Une journee de travail typique chez Amazon se passe généralemnt bien, une bonne accompagnement dans les taches dans la globalite."
good,"Being a picker for Amazon was one of the hardest job I've encountered. It was a fast paced, quick moving, and no screw up job.  The work staff however were wonderful and very helpful."
good,The mileage they expect you to drive does not make up for the money they pay.  They are always trying to get you to take less money than the job is worth. Getting delivery blocks is very time consuming and some days there are no block available.  It's hit or miss.
good,The benefits are awesome but there is a lot that could change. Very fast paced and the pick patterns are horrible.You get pulled around a lot. Very physically demanding.
good,"Near the holiday, amazon was great for overtime. Some of the managers do not know how to talk to you.  It is a very fast paced job. It is also very relaxed."
good,"Amazon Alexa team is adrift.  the team lacks both leadership and direction.  They demand high level performance with little or no direction about what this high level of achievement is for.  there is no direct correlation between the work and product.  there is a major disconnect between the technical staff, the engineers, and the software/ user interface developers.  Biggest major flaw is that their conventions change daily or weekly making continuous workflows impossible."
good,"-12 hour work days usually 4-5 days/week"
good,"Worked hard for 4 years did almost everything when it came to applying for a upper level tiers I kept getting shut down basically favoritisms. I would help different departments  with back log clear it up and keep it minimum to none and still no recognition. Why work hard when you don’t get notice for it..  only when they need you. Lack of management they always come and go. They work you for rate and quality for what they are paying you. If you can’t make it. They hand out write ups like candy.  Loved it at first but when they decided to take away stocks and monthly bonus, with a 1.50 raise it’s not the same amazon from when I first started."
good,"10 to 12 hour work days, it is a good starting job, be willing to work hard for extended hours and have unreal expectations set by the company. Things may have changed since I left; however I have to base my review on my knowledge."
good,"A typical day at Amazon meant clocking in at 7:25 am, starting with finding out where the manager has placed you for the day, in the case of me, i would either pack or go one of the indirect roles at the warehouse which meant being a waterspider (stocking boxes for packers). I would get two paid 15 minute breaks at 10 am and 3:15 pm, paid, and one half hour lunch break, unpaid at noon. After my final break i would continue to work until 6 pm and go home."
good,"Amazon was an okay place to work, I felt over worked, under payed, and definitely underappreciated. They hired en mass so you knew you could be replaced in an instant. Bathroom breaks aren't a thing because you have 6 minutes before you start to accrue ""Time off Task"" and too much, you can be fired. It takes at least 6 min to get to a bathroom in the facility because of the size. 10 hour days with 2, 15 minute* breaks and a 30 minute, unpaid lunch. "
good,When working at an Amazon warehouse expect long physically and mentally challenging days. The company expects their workers to maintain a certain weekly rate which causes adds an unnecessary amount of stress to an already stressful environment. The pay is okay but for the amount of work that we do I believe that we should be paid more.
good,The best thing about amazon is the benefits. great insurance plans. excellent time off options. high expectations on rates. low pay increases for senior employees. all managers seek  to write up associates for anything and everything including going to the restroom.
good,I wouldn’t recommend this job for long-term work. Even less so if you’re looking to advance in the company. It feels more like a side job than something to pay the bills.
good,"the pay difference, if any, for someone driving an order picker and someone who stands in one spot or loads trucks doesn't seem fair.  Its alot more risk, brain power, and stress to operate an order picker."
good,I enjoyed working with the Team at Amazon they kept it really fun and live as any job you have some friendly managers and some not so friendly but i liked getting paid weekly and would still be there if it wasn't for my health.
good,"Minimum salary"
good,"Excellent pay starts out @ 12.00 per hour.25 cent raise every six months, but maxes out at $13.00 per hour. Excellent  benefits that start at day one. long work days. peak season mandatory overtime."
good,"Amazon mc01 Orlando and they want you to work really fast and get good numbers , which I was told I was fanominal be ause I was over the required amount they wanted. Be careful for TOT ( time off task) try not to go to the bathroom often or fill up ur water often because you only get 30 mins. Of TOT you are allowed a day to do those things only, so if you walk across a million square foot place from one side to the other, make sure it's in 2 mins. Not 10 because they are very punctual and TOT accumulates very quickly and will creep up on you. "
good,The people were nice and friendly. Work was extremely stressful. Management treated the employees   like trash.  Long work hours. Long commute. Pay could have better.
good,difficult job. im not going to write a paragraph about this position. So Im looking for a career driven business to where i can help it grow and grow myself within the company
good,Amazon has a lot of poor business practices. Career advancement is hindered by HR policies that prevent employees from obtaining opportunities that matches their skill set. Amazon hires a lot people who work below the standards and refuses to fire subpar workers. Pay is insufficient to standard of living.
good,Okay company to work for hours were ok. Job can be tiring at times. Managers are not people friendly. Benefits were good .There is nothing else to say.
good,"Amazon did a fantastic job of being flexible and allowing you to work the hours that you needed when they were available."
good,"management allows workers who do not follow the safety rules to stay.  those workers do not think they are a problem or a safety threat to other workers because they are allowed to stay.  other co-workers sleep while on the clock.  others of us know of these types of workers and let management know about them, but management keeps them on.  this makes for an atmosphere of ""why bother"".  try to avoid working with these lazy and unsafe workers."
good,"Lots of hard work. There's always constantly something to do, and if not they WILL find something for you to do. Management is always changing, at least a new manager every 4 to 6 months, which can be annoying."
good,"A typical day started with group meeting on what what was expected for the day. Only worked during the holidays very stressful and labor intensive work. Management was ok, but it was a very cliquey place to work, probably the main reason I hated going to work everyday!"
good,"Work hard and influence others to work hard during the day helped others,if they needed help did overtime hours if I had to and was volunteer for those who didn't want to."
good,Under paid for the work expected. The Hr department isn't helpful nor act concerned  about the problems the employees bring to their attention. Also are often times Hr we're not at the station desk where they could easily be found for assistance
good,"its a great opportunity they pay you a great amount per hour. There is a good amount of facilities to keep workers comfortable. The biggest downside is not yet being converted. once you get converted you get a set schedule. if you get hired on as flexible on call you only get a few hours notice to pick up your schedule so it can make balancing things difficult. you have to really bust your chops to get converted, its a bit political but once you do its a good job."
good,OK place to work but supervision lacked professionalism.  I was given a decent amount of responsibility; as much as I wanted.  There was a lot of trust generally but some workers didn't do a whole lot.
good,"Typical day at work included standing in the same spot all day packing with an unrealistic rate to achieve. Management and leads just want you to get your numbers. Hardest part of job is standing around packing in the same spot all day. I did enjoy the times I was allowed to go work on the cherry pickers and pick, though this was very minimal even though I excelled at it."
good,"I was able to work when I wanted. Rarely, if ever, did I have to deal with, or see another person or persons. Working solo was great. Online support was a mess and not easy to deal with. Having to use my personal vehicle was a drawback"
good,"Too much standing on your feet all day ,in the same spot . They also wanted to cut my hair very long hours sometimes work is very slow  managers are very strict on traveling to co workers station or talking to co workers"
good,i managed to get a great group of people and i worked Monday through Thursday so i had the best work schedule you could get but i was so tired of every time i asked to do the more fast pace jobs i would rudely be told no. some managers are better then others my first manager was great so was my pa but my second one not as much
good,"It is Stressful job and no security of your job."
good,"It is very physical work, really easy to hurt yourself, and they don't pay enough for it. The benefits are really good though. The breakroom is usually on the other end of the facility and the walk time is included in your break. So your break is about 6-10 minutes depending on how fast you walk."
good,"6PM- 5 AM.  Heavy lifting, no breaks I've always been a very hard-worke, however there was absolutely no work/ life balance. Having Heath Insurance was a plus,but I knew there were better opportunities in the area."
good,"- poor job/life balance due to long shifts (from 7:30am to 18:00pm)"
good,Site propre bien entretenue avec beaucoup de moyen matériels.Boissons gratuite. Entrepôt climatisé. Débit de travail intensif. Une organisation a tatillon.Formation approximative.
good,"There are two shifts, early in the morning and in the afternoon. It changes week after week. At the beginning, very good experience . Everyone is joyful but comes fast the time when you feel the pressure. I understand the standard in a big company like Amazon but productivity was put behind quality even if the latter was an issue compared to the first. My friend was a good example of this, he did his job very fast but usually committed ten mistakes per day. Productivity can be caught up in the early weeks but to me, you ought not to make mistakes in the early because it hurts Amazon's reputation."
good,"I an arehouse packing box, suggested for immediate, but temporary employment.  No room for advancement, but decent benefit package.  Seasonal work only."
good,"Too soon to rate fully. part time seasonal. I do not have anything else to add about the job. low wage, no benefits. there you go. that is all I can say at"
good,"J'aimais mon poste, la préparation de commande, mais l'entreprise en elle même n’était pas du tout agréable ..."
good,I did enjoy the people just not the work. The pay wasn't comparable  to the amount of work that was required. i feel like all warehouse positions should pay no less than 14 an hour.
good,Just wake up early and deliver packages all day while fighting traffic to and from your depot. Workers are not that friendly and management will be strict.
good,the best part of working for amazon.com is that they would accommodate me up to 10 hours a week for attending class at MyComputerCareer.com so that I can further my education. The worst parts of working for Amazon is that they had no regard for your strengths or previous skillsets when choosing a role for you. There was also a safety issue that was brought to their attention 3 months ago and still hasn't been addressed.
good,"Fast-paced environment, not hard work if dedicated. Needs to pay more for labor. Needs longer lunch breaks and more incentives for employees. Far commute"
good,"ok place to work for great benefits form day on, management is micromanagement and will have no mercy on you for production. if you don't meet your numbers your out the door."
good,"They will write you up so that you cannot change schedules."
good,"Good company to work for., long hours. and alternating shifts without notice.  Great company to work for, for benefits and insurance purposes. Insurance and benefits are great."
good,Its a good place to work. Its a quick easy job to get if your in need of a job. It had its good days and bad but overall it was a fun place to work. But it is a quick paced job.
good,"Amazon Prime is over rated. Its easy to get in with the company if you have what their looking for. Its a lot of favoritism , and management just sit or stand around talking. Not enough pay for the work."
good,"Really long work days, the lunch is unpaid, the breaks are a joke, they expect you to spend most of your break walking to and from your location, so out of 15 minutes for break it is maybe 5... so, less time trying to rest, more time walking, on top of the 30 plus miles a week (as a picker)."
good,The responsibilities are not difficult but they are manually intensive. Employees are required to clear and clean work areas after handling packages for sort and shipment.
good,You are required to maintain a high work rate often lifting heavy items quickly. Almost impossible to get a bathroom break for 3 hours at a time. Breaks are only a half hour long and you get two for a 10 hour shift. Advancement is impossible to spite what they say.
good,"lack of management, they chose to favor one person over another person, they don't give anyone a opportunity for a advancement in other positions when applicable"
good,the hardest part of working at amazon is the hours. worst thing was being overstaffed in my department (packsingles) always had voluntary time off which is nice from time to time but when i need to work and its to slow i get sent to another department and then another
good,"This company has good benefits, like tuition reimbursement and health care.  I learned management has no plans on pay raises, mistakenly believing they are paying competively.  A typical day at work can be very physically demanding depending on your department, due to bending and lifting. The hardest part of the job is when we are not busy makes the 10 hour day even longer. I like to stay busy makes the day go faster."
good,"Management is constantly on you to go faster and faster, get written up for every small thing, constant worry about getting in trouble,extremely short breaks, get written up if even a minute late from break.  Feel like you can't even use the bathroom without getting in trouble."
good,"fast paced environment. Learned to build pallets.  Management is ok. hardest part is during christmas or prime week, gets real busy and can be frustrating."
good,"Amazon has great benefits and was very convenient in many ways, but none of that matters in the end when there is very poor communication across the entire company and very poor management."
good,Though it is a customer service based position it is a great place to get your foot in the door and learn how to effectively field customers and their needs.
good,Fine place to work for young adults with no real bills to pay. especially if they are still leaving at home with parents. Not a good place for people with real life going on
good,"If you're likely to be frustrated by equipment not allowing you to do your job because it is faulty, this is the job for you.  Managers are generally inattentive."
good,You are essentially being trained to be a robot.  MAndatory overtime around Christmas time can be fun. A typical day at work would be to go to the meetup and stretch for about 5 mins then your off to your respective duties till break time.
good,"It a easy job but they're strict on rate ,tot, and quanity errors. I had made a few quanity errors and they waited until I made to many ; without a first and second warning they wrote me up with my first and final write up. They said if I make another quanity error in 90 days I would be terminated. I don't think that was far at all. Thats why I'm currently looking for another job. It so easy to get fired there. U can't make alot of mistakes."
good,"it was a good experience, my problem was the communication standard was very weak in english, supervisor can.t express themselves clearly to what they want you to do, or the training very blurry, not very clear, and review every week couldn't understand hoe i can get better, because again not clear conversation , can't transmit their experiences properly"
good,"This job is perfect for those who can handle doing the same task all day every day. It is very monotonous and boring. There is not any follow through on what is verbally stated will be done. And like most places of employment, there is favoritism galore. If none of that is an issue for you, or you just need money that bad, then good luck on your application. So long as you do not have any major criminal history or fail the drug test, and are breathing, they will hire you!"
good,"At first, working here seemed fun. I have friends that worked here and made new ones working here as well. Overtime, you just get so drained from working about 10 hours a day just walking and jogging all day delivering to houses and businesses. Worked 40 hours a week but because of call outs due to sickness, my hours were cut. Worked 4 days a week and made 40 hours and sometimes more, but now i work only 3 days. Overall, management CAN be fair and hours sometimes are flexible but for the most part, its do as you’re told."
good,"Worked in the problem solving unit and while the work wasn't difficult it got tedious quickly. Work hours were very flexible, with the ability to take time off whenever needed (with certain limitations).  No real ability to move up within the company, and if you do, you don't get paid more for it until you're at the top of the warehouse hierarchy (manager role)."
good,"Stand up, safety obsessed, cost minimization, undervalued. Difficult to find place at the workplace, freedom to get responsibilities done as long as they happen."
good,The head managers play favorites and send workers to Sub-Zero temperatures first 12 hour shifts at a time as punishment for calling that out the pay is decent but not for the amount of work that you do you're constantly running around and a fast-paced environment picking food for customers as for your fellow coworkers some of them are nice others are downright cutthroat they say one thing and do the total opposite behind your back is not a cohesive unit and no one there is happy
good,"the so called leaders don't do anything just stand around or go too the lunch room and sit. be on their phone or laptop even we are not allowed to have phone inside for regular associates."
good,"I enjoyed my career at Amazon, the only downfall was the poor management and lack of room to grow. They will keep you in the same positions for months even years when you ask to be cross trained, they will give you the run around.(At least my warehouse did). Good benefits, great culture of people big variety, and pretty flexible schedule."
good,Fast paced work environment that keeps you on the daily work grind.  There is little to no room to advance or improve yourself at the company.             .
good,Amazon is a good job for someone who is single and doesn't have children. Stressful work environment and you will not get anymore raises once you have been there three years.
good,"They have you picking at a pace that you can't make the amount. they want you to pick 120 boxes an hour and hot to many people can do it, that is why they have such a large turnover rate.I never met my manager the whole time I was there.Employees cant keep up with the 120 boxes per hour so you get negative attitudes."
good,its a great way to meet people and be able to network with other that have traveled with the company. defiantly a job that you can make as a career and then some
good,No career advancement and poor culture are promoting me to search for a job in other companies. I am looking forward to work in a data driven environment with more focus on individual growth
good,"I loved working at Amazon ... doing the job I was hired to do. I enjoy & thrive in fast paced, competitive, and evolving work cultures. The most stressful aspect was the increasing expectation / demand to contribute above & beyond within other departments along with lack of local support for the job I was hired to do. You absolutely have to be self motivated & be able to track your own performance. I learned a lot in a short amount of time that continues to be a benefit to my career."
good,I started with Amazon when the TPA 1 location first opened. Now it is like most of them. Push the people to the point of injuries. You can get trained for other jobs but pay does not increase.
good,"Overall the job was okay, just have to be willing to work, it gets VERY overwhelming at times, especially during peak days. Almost everyday the lines are literally overflowing with packages, and its worse if you are the only one putting in work."
good,Job is a grind with duplicate efforts and really no carryover between decision makers. I made the mistake of leaving something I was very good at only to go to an organization that had everyone out for self
good,I have none. I feel that they don;t pay enough at fresh due to the work enviroment. Tje  gear for cold temperatures are not sufficient. Dangerous working enviroment. I would be more likelyi to for them if not a fresh
good,Depending on what shift you would you may get 18-20 hours weekly. It's based on the amount of employees and packages that need to be shifted per day. So if you looking for a part time it is a good place to work.
good,"Being an employee at Amazon I had many mixed feelings about it. I started as an entry level employee and after seeing my skill set was given many more responsibility without any compensation."
good,"You think you'd know what it's like to work at Amazon, but you have no idea. The whole experience was definitely very eye opening and one I won't forget anytime soon."
good,it is a good company but management is not good because when you go for work you do not know when they send you back may be after one hour or two hours
good,"worked on a contract basis, lacked job security and any benefits, though pay was acceptable for experience level. Not a bad environment if you can secure a position outside of contract work."
good,"I thought this would by my dream job, turned into more of a nightmare, I never suffered from anxiety prior to working for Amazon,"
good,"the success of your career in amazon operations is highly dependent on your manager and or team. if you have a competent manager who is willing to develop you, you can have a successful career. However, there are a lot of managers out there who only focus on themselves. own your own development is the key to success within amazon."
good,"It is very tedious, yet easy work. They overwork you and underpay you. Barely have enough time for outside life. Hard to move up in the company. Has a good education advancement program. Holiday pay. Good overtime opportunity."
good,"Enjoyed working at first but then it started to become long hours. "
good,Hours are to long.  Extremely boring.  They are very disorganized
good,"a typical day at work is very fast paced and you typically will not know what your going to do if you're trained on more than one task at the job. They work on 10 hour shifts and you receive two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch break which is fairly short for working a 10 hour shift while standing,climbing and lifting all day. (not an issue for me but difficult for majority of others) Management is 50/50, there is a huge disconnect between upper management and baseline workers/supervisors in the warehouse. They will adjust rates and change a lot of policies without really understanding work conditions or speaking with front line management and workers in the warehouse. There were plenty of times equipment and conveyor belts in the warehouse were down/broken for months which would slow down productivity, then upper management would come in months later with concerns on the productivity of the location which could've been addressed within hours or days if communication was expedited quickly and correctly. We would work overtime for weeks consecutively due to the same issues.(which wasn't a problem for me but other employees would be very upset.) Majority of managers i had were nice and knowledgeable. Then on the other hand I had managers where i had more knowledge on how things were done, which would frustrate me at times because they would rely on me to do tasks outside of my job title. The issue with amazons management is they rotate them too much to the point where you will have a supervisor for months, and you will not even know who they are. a lot of managers come from"
good,"there are some things i like about it (like the free hot drinks cheap lunch meal good exercise and a window shoppers paridise)"
good,"Performance expectations are set for each facility based on comparable sites, or as close as possible.  However, no 2 sites are the same so the performance will not be the same.  The site that performs below the other(s) is driven beyond reason, with management being worked to unhealthy levels and never able to achieve goals."
good,Working at Amazon I have went through a lot of ups and downs. One of the key things I enjoy about this company is the benefits and activities. Amazon has a lot of room for improvement when it comes to its management and opportunities for career advancement.
good,Customer obsession is main motto of this company. Employee friendly. This company will spend more concentration on employee engagement activities and work culture.
good,"Amazon is an unpleasant place to work. Associates are not treated like humans; the managers only care about the numbers. Associates get in trouble for taking longer than five minutes in the restroom, it's not realistic. Most of the time, it takes anywhere from two-three minutes to GET to the restroom. I never felted valued as a person."
good,too many teenagers in management at this moreno valley location which makes it a little difficult to be productive. overall too many workers on one shift as well.
good,"would rethink how employees are treated, how they are promoted. Many of the company policies were not carried out by management. Overall decent place to work"
good,"They treat employees like robots and they will try to ruin your personal life completely by asking you to do over time (forcibly)."
good,"At the Sort Center is where I was employed. They hire just anybody the interview is online-based. There was a lot of slack. Workdays were good when everyone would participate in working at a high rate. There were only 2 available shifts. 3p.m.-7p.m. or 8:30p.m.-12:30a.m. That part was never flexible and the main issue I had with that job. No overtime allowed. Only during November and December is when you could earn 55 hours a week. Once January hit, back to 25 hours per week tops."
good,Ten hour shift of picking orders filling orders shipping orders. Some day we only had 4 employee on a shift. Associates usually got along with everyone. Very helpfully if ever anyone didn't understand.
good,Great place to work if you are looking to lose weight or stay in shape. Part time hours are awesome because you get to manage your entire day. However with all that Amazon offers its consumers the offer their staff very little.
good,It is a perfect summer job for young people with no family to take care of but terrible for older people and not compensated enough for the effort it requires.
good,"I would sort order into their right section "
good,"150-180 drops a day say you can do route in 9 hrs obviously nobody in management has done it, regular 12 hours plus days. Good money but no life blah blah blah blah blah"
good,"i have worked at amazon for 5 yeas and need a new challenge. I had my good days and bad days, my long days and my short days, but with the cost of living going up i need to look for a job with better pay."
good,pay was good 
good,Not a great place to work for. This Organization has some good things to work for but our management was not good at all. The work life harmony norm does not exist in actual
good,"Working from home was convenient. The late afternoon shift was not so good for me, as I am a morning person. The training was involved, but Amazon sells so much, it was still chaotic to find answers to all the customer questions."
good,I am a low man on the totem pole but I developed a system to help people have fun and work hard on a daily basis. Now because my idea was working better then the upper mangers plans they did not back my program and when i had to take a few days off because my son was sick they stopped the program.
good,"Overall I would have better enjoyed my work with Amazon, if not for my situation. I had no supporting department team members on site, which led me to wrongfully believed my hard work dedication reliability and customer focus would award me the advancement I sought."
good,The standards are very high in every department where alot seems to be ways to cheat the computers. Everyone gets tired by mid-day and anytime you fall behind you will stay behind. To me alot of it seemed to be about knowing the right people in the right places.
good,"Some management make it an amazing place to work but they always leave on all levels staff turn over is high,"
good,"I would work there is I was single without a family but with a family there is no room for kids been sick or taking vacation. Pto isn't very good, only 20hrs and you work 10 hour days"
good,"A physically exhausting job, without much chance of being promoted.   HR is pretty helpless, and if you have a problem with the management team, you can't talk to any one since everything has to go though them."
good,I started out as a temp to hire. and I got hired on and eventually became a supervisor/PA and later a facilities technician. from my experience they say they care about not only the safety but also they promote progress within your career. I can't speak for myself but i can speak for others. especially the over worked underpaid dock workers in outbound. and how they hire an outsider to run a section when clearly you have more qualified individuals on the inside that can run circles around their so called new boss that makes bad decisions. also instead of analyzing the issue and considering what is happening they are only concerned about rates. and they kept increasing the rates. they also put old people on the docks when its clear they should not be there.
good,"One goes to apply for a job at Amazon and has no idea of what they will be doing until they get there. It sucks you in depletes your soul, depression sinks in and you become void of any human characteristics, you are a number, not a face.  You wonder why you applied."
good,"The job was fine what it was; a part-time job at a warehouse. They expect for you work while you're there and get the job done. Although, sometimes the managers could be a little annoying."
good,fast paced and always busy; have to be highly organized and ready to learn and jump in where needed. culture is not conducive to work life balance unless maybe higher position
good,"throughout the year amazon includes all associates in work events which Is really fun, they also have giveaways that include scratchera,also they provide a food truck which is really cool."
good,My e Time at Amazon was ok It was hard to balance a life being A single mother trying to work the days they had me working A day at Amazon long and tired management was not good also because some people was new to their job also the hardest part of the job is worry about your productivity everyday and staying in one place the only thing I enjoyed about the job is the benefits
good,Hard but awarding work. Could be stressful. Fasted paced environment. Competitive environment. Good wages for the work required. People are decent. Fun at times.
good,Scattered management styles at site.  Sometimes only focused on production and not quality.  The Amazon culture at corporate did not exist at sites I worked at.
good,"A typical day is extremely fast paced, and dynamic - priorities change very quickly. Work life balance is very limited, and can certainly take a toll on family life. "
good,"I was ecstatic to be accepted to work at Amazon, until about the 5 1/2 month mark. Amazon's job culture is very stressful in that they can change your work group with little advance training and no warning whatsoever; the same goes for changing your team manager. You log on one day and receive an email that you are now a different work group that you have no experience in. Change is good, but not at the expense of employee morale and the overall experience of the customer. It feels very sink or swim at times. I value a job well done, and sometimes Amazon makes it impossible to feel as if you are doing well."
good,"Salle de pause agréable "
good,In candid opinion i did not found something much
good,"With 8 years intense experience working for a national parcel company, I was more than equipped to carry out a sorting role for Amazon on a temporary basis. The working environment was clean and of a high standard but I felt like cattle during the role. The agency, like most agencies, seemed to omit certain key information like shift availability and different rates of pay, but I was there for extra cash so I did mind too much."
good,"exhausting, work to home life sucks.if can't work you have to use your vacation days or unpaid time.favoritism,late they minus 1 hour pay.heavy pallots   given to 1 person."
good,"can get very boring locked in a cage picking orders for 10 hours "
good,"Travail bien, les managers devrait donner plus au intérim et les aider plus"
good,"if you are desperate for a check, they'll give you one for a little while. job is pretty straight forward,but the building is a revolving door for not only regular employees,  but management as well."
good,"You make good money but you will work extra a hard to make . The company tends to care about nothing besides numbers, you can get write ups very easily and they don't care if you are working six days a week 10 hour shifts and your beat"
good,Amazon is a hard place to work.  They have a rate of 100% and they do not work with people on it.  Instead of trying to see if the person would work better in a different area they just fire you.  If you want a different area you have to reapply later.
good,"Ever heard of the Pink Floyd song Welcome to the Machine? Pretty much is applicable here through and through. It's definitely not a hard job, like most production jobs out there. But 10 hours a day 4 to 5 to 6+ (during peak) a week can really creep into your body if you're not careful. And job security? There really isnt any; I manage to pump out a 120-130% production rate each week to no avail. Yes it is my fault that I worked myself into the ground but all I desired was some cross-training. There is a cross training book that Ive been in for months that they dont really seem to utilize. Plus at every all hands warehouse-wide meeting they claim ""You're #1 in the network!"" yet we dont get paid as such."
good,"Employees could be appreciated more. And the pay is way low for the physical strain on one's body. Atmosphere can be good, but it is very intimidating and really physically demanding work."
good,Clock in  stretch straight to work bell rings stop get through maze as quick as possible to receive what you could of your break bell rings back to work bell rings move quick paced to break bell rings back to work for a cheese that only satisfied momentarily.
good,"I worked with Amazon.com as a temporary employee. The work load and production expectations were very strenuous and sometimes hard to attain. There were no sympathy for elderly workers, or for workers that could not physically keep up. Although I was able to keep up, I felt for many of the employees who couldn't.  If you are looking for decent seasonal pay, and are ready to break a sweat, give them a try."
good,"Competitive workplace that emphasized on maintaining a set rate. Very little time for breaks, people were injured and died on the job due to over exertion. Very hard work."
good,"Decent job, great benefits, a lot of amazing people to work beside and good exercise. Amazon may be hard work and long hours but its a job that will work with you and help you advance in life, from college classes to Amazon providing their own classes for associates Amazon is a very decent place to work."
good,"Loved The Environment, Was Able To Maintain Work Ethics, Able To Add Work Experience To My Resume,  Loved Learning New Work Experiences. Had To Deal With Packing Light Objects as well as heavy objects"
good,"The people I worked with were some of the most hardworking individuals I know, but like me, were unable to advance in the company due to constant changes in management."
good,"at first it was great, good pay and good hours. After some time they opened up new warehouses and the work from our building slowly decreased and we would work 3 hours. That's not enough for paying bills and such."
good,The thing about Amazon is you knew what was expected of you and what you would be doing when you walked in every day. You had a set schedule and that what you worked (until Christmas season). But it was a very Dry place to work. You are their little work horses and you have to be able to push out as much orders as possible.
good,a normal day is between 10-11 hours a day not much training given the management team were very self motivated . a very multi cultured environment. The hardest part of the job was no getting your full break . there was no real job satisfaction and no recognition for what you did.
good,"Ce fut une expérience agréable pour moi et un très bon environnement de travail, je souhaite le recommander à tous"
good,O experienta nu prea placuta . aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
good,"Clocking in do stretches and here the volume and news for the day. once we got to our areas, for me as a problem solver was always a mess. Morning shifts would hardly touch any of the damages packages and if they did would be well after there two hours. How much can they really process in two hours may a pallet if it's not completely damaged. so we would come into horrible conditions i would ask to bring more trained associates to help take the volume load faster. was always denied , training was always done through the ambassadors who were not even trained them selves in that department. so would have to work really fast and determine if walking for our 15 min break was even worth the walk . two hours mandatory on ups because we would have the last shipment during the afternoon shift not even working on the damages items. so now that leaves us with this mornings damaged packages on top now of our two hour damages built up because we have to work on another task intill 5 oclock. then unrealistically they want us to have zero packages in our department by the end of the shift with 4 people in seperate areas. equally as backed up. the managers will always demand we stay later and if we did't they would pull us from the area and have someone else there. management wouldn't care about our feelings the work load anything they were worried more about their numbers then the well being of their employees and the customer packages that are going to miss promise dates. the hardest job in the ware house would be trying to get assistance for any fucntioning department. one thing that i"
good,"Dobry kolektiv pripraveny vždy pomoci druhemu,zadne rasove rozdily ."
good,While the managers and my fellow employees were all pleasant people to be around; the overall culture at an Amazon warehouse is incredible soul crushing. It should only be considered by someone with extensive warehouse experience and is able to continually beat their own quotas as that is what will be expected of you week-in and week-out.
good,Okay job but felt like high school when working on shift. Too much gossip. Pay was okay. And management was fair. Didnt like how i would work and then see other people screwing around and make us stay later than we had to because they wouldnt work.
good,"The employee benefits package is great, and begins day one.  However, there are times, called Peak, when the demand for labor is mandatory, and the hours are longer than the typical 10 hour day, 12 hours to be exact."
good,It's moderate. You don't get paid enough working at a billion dollar company when the associates working in the warehouse are your key players in that game.
good,good job. not good hours. lots of favoritism. management was okay. the most enjoyable part of my day was sorting. if I could've done that all day that would've been great. but they had me making pallets and lifting 60lb boxes all night.
good,"the work was easy the rate of pay is also good to, was pretty much left alone to do my work with ease "
good,"Amazon of the past was a place with some really talented engineers, and a great place to start your career. You had access to amazing mentors and engineers who were solving retail problems with some of the most advanced software out there."
good,"The expectations for stowers to achieve their rate time and number of items stowed per that time is unrealistic. When you factor in water spider response time, items falling on the floor, and the weight and quantity of each item, the ""requirements"" for stowers is absurd."
good,"Amazon needs to realize that their workers are are people and not numbers. Little to no advancement are apparent when trying to move from a tier 1 position to a tier 3 position,"
good,Die meisten mitarbeiter sind nett aber der rest nicht
good,I worked for Amazon flex as an indepednant contractor for  2 years. I would say it wasn't bad.It is a new project A lot of  work needs to be complete . It is a great  place  to work  if you like to be flexible. But dont expect to make your career here.
good,The job had great benefits but not enough time was given to myself so I can achieve a 4.0 in school. It also paid excellent but I was always sore and tired from always over working myself here.
good,"A typical day as a stower at Amazon had you grabbing a u-boat of items and proceeding to find spots to place them on the shelves until they were ready to be picked up to get ready for shipment.  Something that was hard to do, especially during the holiday season.  Most of the shelves are already full of products, so space was limited for a lot of people and you had to make sure you kept you rate up for items per minute being put away."
good,"Most of the time it is unorganised and you just sit around waiting."
good,I enjoyed working for amazon. I just didn't feel like I was reaching my full potential as I prefer customer facing roles. I don't have a full drivers licence and my ADHD made it a difficult place to work as they employ thousands of people so you don't get to pick and choose the job role you do.
good,"Have too be extremely quick otherwise you get penalized and singled out, no time for social life as you're too tired from long hours. Almost no support in workplace and they pick at everything you do wrong."
good,It's a safe work environment but you don't really have time to get to know your coworkers. Every thing is so fast paced. You don't get enough time to actually enjoy or relax on your breaks or lunch.
good,"Try to work hard and get accurate numbers to get picked up by the consolidation team. They don't work by rate so they can work at their own pace, although, you are dealing with large inventory."
good,"Journée de travail très active."
good,"Ambiance de travail super agréable , un bon esprit d'équipe ."
good,"Hard to maintain a life outside of Amazon, always there... Very short, almost nonexistent breaks, feet hurt , don't allow Dr notes to excuse you from work so you must use your paid time accruals, do not recommend for pregnant women"
good,I find the style of management and general practice is designed to only be sustainable by those capable of the hours and intensive labor. It's not inherently wrong or bad but you will be worked to a degree that can be exhausting of mind and body.
good,Great part time job wouldn't expect much as far as advancements or benefits just a great way to spend a few hours making some extra cash. And weekly pay is always a bonus.
good,the hours are long. if you don't mind standing for 10 hours its cool. i worked from 630pm-5 in the morning. a lot of people say picking is hard but i dont think it is since im more of a person that keeps to myself anyway. but there are people on the floor with you who are really cool to talk to if you are that type of person.
good,Not enough hours during the week. I needed a hour week to help support myself and my four children. We only would work 20 hours a week or less. Can't live on that.
good,"The management at Amazon have a fast turn over rate so rarely do you find competent managers. Everyday at work feels like a marathon. Great if you like fast paced, extremely repetitive work."
good,Nothing to comment on. I do not wish to say anything. Health insurance benefits are great. Nothing else to report on at this time. Please let me continue!
good,"very busy time conscious working environment, great opportunity to further a career choice in education, extremely vigorous shifts because the job includes walking and standing through out the shift"
good,"Upper management does not really care for their employees. This business has such a high turnover rate that you're hardly considered at all. "
good,I was hired as a full time associate but at the same time I dont receive full time hours becasue if the work is not there you get sent home. not happy at all
good,"Everything is true. You do work hard, but it was nice to know that you're working toward problems that have never been worked on before. Definitely not for the faint of heart."
good,"i learned some but nothing that i really feel like talking about, so i going to keep my comments to myself, but it was not my favorite job, that i had ever had"
good,"loved the atmosphere. it was fun working there. great co-workers. i learned how to handle a package and box it up fast and place on the conveyor belt. for it to be shipped on time.2- 30 min lunch breaks. they have nurse office on-site, they didn't have no dress-code. I enjoyed it."
good,"The area of package handler was easy for me, you had to pack of a certain speed to keep rates up, but if rates were not made by the packer, the packer would get a verbal, then a written notice and eventually get fired."
good,"I see that there can  be should much improvement on all aspects of working for amazon. Lack of management support on all levels. I work for one company for over forty years and we always strive for constant improvement. Safety,customer service,productivity and cost was our highest priority."
good,"Amazon is a stressful work environment. Work is strenuous and fast paced. There is little opportunity for salary advancement. Overall work culture has changed with disregard to drug use, educational requirements and individuals ethics."
good,"To much time off your life, strainful on back and body. Overall the job is only good for the money, but even then it needs to be more than what is offered already"
good,"constantly nagged at, cant go to the toilet without being called idle. dont get no breathing time always rushed to find space on stow. agencies are of  no help."
good,"Wear great comfortable shoes. Bring as little to work with you as possible as you do go through metal detectors and cellphones and car keys are not allowed on the floor and are to be left in lockers. Bring your own lunch if able but don’t expect to eat it until the end of your shift. Bring your own lunch if you’re health and/or fitness conscious as the snacks and foods provided in the break room are a joke and seriously more like a kid’s dream to the grocery store-if you’re diabetic or have high blood pressure then be cauitious as they dominantly offer high sodium, sat fats and sugary snacks/foods."
good,If you don't meet the requirement then you get written up and the requirements are outrageous. Very poor management and even worse human resources. I would not work there
good,I was working through a temp service at Amazon.  I found the work tedious so I became a SMX coach because I like to help people.  That led to me becoming an SMX supervisor and a few months after that SMX lost the contract with Amazon so I had to find another job through SMX.
good,this is a good job if you are inbetween things they dont really treat you great but will keep you busy but unless you get a blue badge you arent treated properly
good,This is a fast paced environment especially during peak. Managers have there favorites and it is usually the people that get their work done. They need to increase there pay rate though and that is why a lot of people leave.
good,Not a terrible place to work but not the best. Long hours with high demand and short breaks. Depends on the team and not individual numbers. Does have good benefits
good,"A typical day starts with all employees going to ""Stand Up"".  There we get to stretch, learn about what we have done right and what improvements needs to be made.  We also get to learn if we have been meeting our quota as well as what the day shift has already done.  "
good,"The benefits and salary is the only good thing in there. The management sucks a loooot. They will hire new people and not even a month later, they will fire them just because they are not reaching the quota. I mean, they've only been there for a month and they will receive warnings already. It should be expected from them because they are still learning. It's like amazon thinks the people will do what they want them to do just because they work for them. And what's with the ratings??? It's bs!"
good,"After working for Amazon I would say that the work is not hard or bad. Though the hours seem endless when working nights, Amazon is an amazing for their easy-going hiring process. I don't think that the pay is as well as it could be for the serivces and time that Amazon's Associates provide, still they have a great team building experience and everyone is friendly. This is a job that will allow you to stay aflot when you are inbetween careers, or working while in school, or maybe even an awesome first job. I do not consider this a career field."
good,More associate appreciation lack of managers communications better leadership better benefits better job security better pay longer lunch breaks longer breaks
good,"Consistently brought in outside hires as managers as opposed to advancing from within. Made many middle managers frustrated and unmotivated, contributing to low overall moral amongst associates."
good,Amazon hiring cdl drivers they will have to pay a lot more than what I've seen advertised. Just like people working on the the docks low pay hard work and no overtime
good,"Work you as hard as they can with pay raises only being about 0.50$ every six months with a max to how many raises you get. "
good,"I worked 10 hours a day, I learned how to fast pace, the culture workplace is great but not providing the right accommodations. Hardest part is to beat the productivity. I enjoyed meeting people, earning for living and I calls that's a challenging job I ever had!"
good,I learned how to work in a passive aggressive environment where employee happiness was championed regardless of goals and output. I learned a great deal about different styles of management.
good,"Amazon is a great place that gave me an opportunity. I was able to work in all aspects of the operations. Unfortunately, if you are not in an indirect  you will be extremely tired mentally and physically after a shift. As for management there main purpose is that rates are hit. The best part of the job is the variety of people."
good,I would not recommend Amazon as a workplace for anyone. It is not have equal opportunity. The pay is not worth the amount of work you have to do there.
good,The work environment was decent. It seemed to be more of a job for younger generations that were new to the work force and were trying to build a career history.
good,"Good pay. you can be with a great team or terrible team. Probably a terrible team but if you are the luckiest guy in the world, maybe a good team. "
good,"Just as it reads above. Management is always changing too. "
good,Workday was too long and hard wish the shift was 8 hours instead of 10 hours. Management was immature and showed favoritism to their friends instead of making it fair for everyone
good,Amazon is one of the best companies I have worked for. You work with some of the smartest people in the world on your path to be the best. You are encouraged to make your own goals and progression.
good,"I am working at Amazon as I an in need of a job. The place is good to work but it is not employee friendly, the company focuses on customers and employees have to deal with the pressure and no job security."
good,"The amazon in cranbury, NJ is a very fast pave place to work. You are on your feet the whole 10 hours. The breaks are short and fast. They should offer part time for mom's or students but they don't. Be prepared for your feet to hurt and be physically exhausted at the end of your shift. The pay if okay at $14.00 per hpur."
good,"Career growth is hard if you do not have a manager who knows what they themselves are doing. Expect to work long hours especially during the holiday period. 6 day weeks, 12 hours long are the norm from October to January."
good,Facendo orari notturni era molto faticoso ma il mio incarico non mi dispiaceva.
good,You must meet your quota or you will get written up. If you get 5 write-ups you get fired. Extremely fast-paced and physically demanding. Be ready to ache and sweat. MINIMUM of 40 hours a week but will more likely work 55-60.
good,bonne entreprise mais très a cheval sur la production assez rapidement après le démarrage au seins de l'entreprise.
good,Biggest complaint is that managers are pretty much never on the same page so you get different answers from everyone yet YOU are still held accountable in the end for what you do even if that means you being terminated. High turn over rates.
good,requires a lot of walking so you must be prepared for that. hardest part of the job is not being able to interact while working so you feel like a robot. the enjoyable part is you don't always have somebody looking over your shoulder breathing down your neck.
good,You were trained in you were either inbound or outbound. Then got broke down from there. It was very fast paced in outbound. Time usually went by really fast during the shift
good,It's an ok place to work good money but long hours and hard work and the work environment can be very hard sometimes.  But if you don't mind then it isn't bad
good,"This is a company with, a fastpass and challeging, work environment. It is has the luxury of good people, hard workers, and strong teams. How ever, management is trained with an an, us against them mentality, causing a constancy in low morale. A trend of underpaying and passing over, provingly worth 2nd level associates, is also comon."
good,You are isolated and every second is accounted for. Bathroom breaks were nearly prohibited. Management is not friendly and the work environment is not ideal
good,Great place to get your foot in the door as far as getting warehouse experience. I learned how to work in multiple areas in the building. Getting my pit license was one of the areas.
good,There are positives and negatives. The negative reason im leaving should never occur at any company. There is a LOT of room for educating the human resources and payroll departments all across the board.
good,"Seasonal work through amazon is alright, they really care about their employees to a point. The little medical center they have is wonderful in case you sprain your ankle or need to ice your knee. However if you have breathing trouble do NOT be a picker it's all fast paced and they do heavily focus on your percentage scores if you're not in that margin you're fired after your contract for the season is up, but if you manage to keep them up all season then you have a chance to be hired on fully time not just as a temp."
good,"physical demanding, always have to hit your numbers, they give warnings for everything, very stressful, they don't let you sit down only at the breaks."
good,"I had one of the easier jobs at Amazon, as an inventory control associate. I was required to count inventory, and I was also trained in problem solving which required me to fix various problems with inventory including incorrect titles and damaged items. When I left on maternity leave I had an amazing management team. However when I returned everything had completely changed and it was no longer a place I enjoyed working."
good,"I was not employed through a temp agency as others. I was strictly a Amazon seasonal employee with out any of the benefits offered. Long hours, decent pay."
good,it was fast paced noisy and a learning experience I learned more customer service since it was over the phone and they cant see what you see. I learned about technology too
good,"I took the job because I needed income right away.  I am seriously overqualified for this job but I needed the money and started immediately .  "
good,it was a good place to work I got too move too docks ever now and then and I was in the top five packers and the bosses were good people I was getting converted but they did not have the same days so I lost transportation
good,Great benefits but extremely busy. Always on your feet straight 11 maybe 12 hours straight. You gotta hope you get placed in a good position or your gonna be miserable.
good,"great with benefits, bad with employees, plenty of work, horrible management, money ok especially through peak seasons. lots of walking and no leanency of rules."
good,in my 2 years at Amazon it was a decent place to work with good benefits and a very good pay scale and the work wasn't so bad either. my main complaint is that the hours are odd regardless of your shift and they can often make it difficult to have a real life outside of work the worst part was probably the management they change and swap managers between buildings all throughout the company that by the time a manager finally becomes competent enough to do their job (which was almost never) and had finally gotten acquainted with everyone they were gone and somebody new would come along and change all the processes again.
good,"Great incentives, but bad management. Job security is not there. Always worried when the next write up will come due to the Rate being driven up. very little apparition."
good,"I enjoyed the days that I did not have to work in Stow. I was able to get out of the department for a while and help in other areas that did not require a rate! But when it game time for production, I was not up to par! Some days I really felt like a robot! Therefore my job was terminated."
good,"*A typical day is stressful "
good,"This company cares about their employees, but the culture and promotion process is aimed towards not promoting hard work, but with hiring young, college graduates instead. This produces a horrible management to employee relationship. The management feels entitled and has no problem showing it. It is next to impossible to get promoted in any of their warehouses, no matter how hard you work."
good,Pretty average warehouse environment.  Some stations required more work than others.  Management is very arrogant however.  Basic employees have little to no say.
good,"If you can joke about Amazon being the new form of slavery, that is a bit of an issue. "
good,"Great place to work, Stressful atmosphere in Bangalore Seller services. Work shifts are horrible. 4 rotational shifts. Supervisors are not allowed to participate in rating team members."
good,"I tried to move up in the company that's my goal"
good,"Productive workplace not enough hours during non peak season, breaks were to short. I was there for the grand opening a lot of confusion. The encentives during the peak season were great."
good,I was terminated due to production.  They always said do your best and you will be fine.  Not the case. The pick routes were horrible and they keep uping the production rates
good,"The job pays very well, and you definitely receive great hours during peak season. The constant pushing of making rate, kind of made the experience little to be desired. Management was not much help either. A constant turnover rate of people being hired and fired."
good,"The wages is between £8/9 per hour if you are employee,working shifts 4 days per week,3 breaks(2x15 minutes paid and 30 minutes unpaid),from 15 minutes break you walking 6 minutes(go and return),I start working  from last year in August and until now I have no training,a lot of favouritism even if I'm top performers on productivity,quality and attendance  they don't care.They don't appreciate any employee."
good,"Worked nights ten hour shifts six days a week, draining, fast paced, working alone, pay is good but youd be too busy to enjoy it. quit because of harrasment."
good,worst place ever. management sucks. they don't know what they are doing they bring in new managers who follow the ones that don't know anything. everything is just discombobulated
good,"Managers show favoritism, last minute overtime like literally as soon as you get to work boom 11 hour shifts plus 1 extra work day so thats 11 hours 5 days a weeks sometimes 6. Only a 25 cents raise every 6 months . The building is hotter than satans toenails . Ive been there since oct 2016 in the trucks loading and Ive been to the packing department. No matter where you go you will not be happy ."
good,Management are clueless and majority don't treat staff great. Very hard work with no real thanks for meeting expectation really not worth it. It would be ok if you're young can't see anyone of any real age to enjoy it.
good,"My opinion of the company is not as a whole because the company is innovative and I love being a part of it all. Being pushed passed your perceived limits to help create new practices and systems. The poor job security, management and job culture low rating is due to the lack of knowledgeable and confident members of management."
good,"Woking very long hours, you are provided with three breaks 2-15 min and 1-30 min unpaid break. you have to meet your goals or you will be written up which can lead to termination. Very fast pace work environment and 100% standing on you feet the entire day. NO SITTING PERIOD."
good,"For the amount of work that you do, you recieve very little compensation. The work is tedious and often hard to complete. For an hours work non stop you make an average of around 2.00 depending on the task."
good,"Great part time job for a few extra bucks! Can't really build here past warehouse work. Manual labor is required! Not a career choice, but great side job."
good,My training manager was the only reason I stayed as long as I did. He was an energetic and likable guy but the job itself was not enjoyable. An unknown of when you might be terminated creates an uneasiness about job security. Wish they would just hire straight full time part time so those can receive benefits if they are full time.
good,i loved this job but the hr team let me go because of a technicality  it's very fast paced and you need to make rate or you could get fired other than that it's an ok job but you work long hours
good,"The job is not the issue at all. Great benefits, easy days. You can move around to other departments if you want. The management is absolutely awful. Good luck keeping your job."
good,"If you can get in the door here, and you're fairly new to the industry, this is a fantastic place in which to learn new skills and try new things. Your manager (and, to a lesser extent, your team) will make or break the experience you have here."
good,"It was tough being a full-time student woking 13 hour days at times. The management isn't so bad. Company needs better understanding of the workers. Overall, very rewarding."
good,"Very fast paced and your stow rate is monitored hourly. They have a person that comes around hourly with your rate and tells you how bad your doing and asking what is the problem your not moving fast enough. You are stowing items into bins and the bins are on the warehouse shelves. Your pretty much stuffing the bins with product, I would hate to be a picker, picking these bins you have to scan the product to make sure its correct. Most of the product is smalls from China."
good,"Amazon is a good place to work if you are looking for a job, but unfortunately its hard to make it a career. The employee and management turnover is astronomical and the hours are can vary from less than 20 hours a week to 60 hours a week at a moments notice. But, they do offer great benefits and a good hourly wage, as well as paid and unpaid time off."
good,"No day at work is the same- definition of dynamic and fast-paced.Data collates hourly and plans are re-adjusted every two and a half hours . More responsibilities put onto the plate of an Area Manager in large facilities than are physically able to be accomplished. Expectations set high. Do not expect hand-holding, coaching, or any leadership development or high level support. Not for the weak of heart, will, or for anyone looking for a stable work environment,"
good,"I was hired as a seasonal employee."
good,I learned a lot at Amazon however the cost was my confidence and dealing with a condescending atmosphere.  I became a better programming but I started liking the material less.
good,All Fulfillment Centers are not created equal. FTW1 doesn't have a strict hiring process... creating at times a Hostile/Questionable work environment.
good,"I was in a new department and there was no support from managers whatsoever. Job tasks were not clearly outlined, and when it was, it was so repetitive that they now automatised the process. Yes, they replaced us with robots ! Employment is contractual for too long and planning for contract renewal is non existant."
good,The nice thing about working at Amazon is their benefits. What type of company will get you couple shares of stock when you're direct hired on with them .
good,"A day consists of 12 hour shifts with very little breaks (30 min). Company does not value ESL employees, and management refuses to listen to ESL employee's queries. Workplace culture is toxic, encouraging overwork and unhealthy productivity. The hardest part of the job is Picking, seeing as they set a ridiculously hard and un-achievable targets, which no human can reach. The most enjoyable part of the job is clocking out on the pay date."
good,Pick items on a order picker for 10 hours. Everyone is friendly and gets along. The hardest part of the job is to make rate every day which makes the job stressful.
good,"Steady, honest work with a fine set of benefits that wasn't too strenuous, but they don't know how to manage their employees effectively--or don't want to."
good,"its quite hard to move up, unless you become buddy-buddy with managers outside of work. expect to work hard with little or no recolonization and work overtime for other departments who are too lazy to come in."
good,hard and fast-paced its hot and tiring walking 10 miles a day this place is easy money but hard work I see people crying after work not a job for weak
good,"If you can meet a quota everyday then it is for you, If not, its not the job for you. Its a good paying job but not everyone will agree its worth the money. No advancement opportunity's unless you apply for a management position to begin with. You dont get to pick your hours, when you can or cant work. Not enough breaks. Best part of the job is when you get to go home!"
good,"Starting off as a temp through an agency, i have to say is the worst experience. Despite your problems, your agency couldnt give a toss. Never there for you when you need them the most. They only ever come and see you when they need to, tell you how bad you`re doing... "
good,"I didnt enjoy working at Amazon  because you didnt get treated with respect. You got in trouble for going to the toilet you got in trouble for having a drink, Every hour you would get told your rate,  the target was ridiculously high you had to pack something like 1000 an hour."
good,"The working is very transactional , so managers at different level tend to shift within & out side very frequently."
good,"was told when i applied it was 12 an hour, 3 days after orientation and drug test they sent out an email saying they were ""hacked"" and it was 11 an hour. Everything else just went downhill from there. The only good thing was the benefits which i was only paying 30 a month for health, dental, and vision for just myself."
good,"Seems great at first benefits are good. Managers done care, don't want to train you or let you advance. Only care about numbers for shipping and receiving. How much or little we put out in a day."
good,"Depending on your job placement and who you know at this place, depends on how well you will do. If in stow, unless you work on the racks or case to tote line. Then its nearly impossible to keep your job. In stow there is almost no job security and management doesn't really seem to care about who is working their butts off or who doesn't barely work."
good,"Amazon is a good company to work for, especially if you have a degree. There is room for improvement at conveying reliable information, including the communication between the different departments and management. It also has a few strict policies that sometimes can be a bit unwieldy to enforce or add extra burdens to everyone."
good,"They may have great benefits but they're management and workplace culture is something to be laughed at. They work you until you are dry, then once you finally think you have a day off. They'll give you a 24 hour notice that theres mandatory overtime. If you have anything medical related happen to you, they wont cover you. Just take out the time they give you, such as UPT (Unpaid Time) and PTO (Paid Time-Off) which you accrue every pay period."
good,"Has great potential to be a fun environment that is worker friendly, but care very little about blue collar employees. If you want to matter you must either gain favor of a manager or be direct hire to management or senior ops."
good,"Amazon is a great company for consumer convince, however, it comes with a cost of a high pressure job for warehouse employees with very little job security. In short, if you are not a high-leveled salary member of management within the fulfillment center, you will always come to work each day feeling as if you can be fired at any given moment, even as a supervisor. It is a place that will teach you how to be political to get support from upper management, when you come up with ways to make things more efficient and productive. The management team will rather replace their employees than to properly coach and train them. Maybe that's due to AMZN recruiting those fresh out of college (i.e. those with little to no people or organizational skills), and have them manage a large team, typically 50-150 employees, per level one management. I would only recommend this job to those who are looking for temporary experience in supervisory work, as such, because the average job length mgmt. will allow us either right before you first year, or you second, so that you cannot obtain the benefits that come when you hit those milestones with the company(e.g. paid-schooling, company stock, etc.)."
good,Generally temperary work that doesn't last long I stay in dunoon travel wasn't payed for or compensated witch took a large chunck out of wages if I was to work there again I would relocate
good,"solve problems, unload trucks, lift move and sort boxes, Pick pack ship, quality control. Most days i think its like being a robot and many of of leave sore and tired."
good,"I worked there. The managers were all fake. The money was good, if you did overtime. Honestly the money was great, I cant lie. You get a lot of time off."
good,"If you feel like working harder than everyone else while they are taking their time to get things done, this is the place for you.  This place is terrible because the managers will tell you (if you're a man) to lift all of the heavy boxes while they'll talk to the females.  If the job description says you need to be able to lift at least 50 pounds and you can't do that, why even show up?"
good,"Very great place to work, great benefits, a lot of opportunities for overtime however with the given hours, you rarely have time for yourself. HR seems to know nothing and always refer you to the Hub and some of the managers are horrible at what they do."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work if you are a physically fit person as it requires long hours of standing while lifting light to heavy boxes. "
good,"management are good, discipline. work culture friendly. The hardest part to stand whole day or night in the job place if we are in job. Thay are not flexible with the job time and leave ."
good,"Pros: Money, Smart People, Interesting Business Model"
good,This place is super strict with their time and attendance policy. They do not listen to their employees explanations of why something was going the way it should. Many people are terminated without explanation here.
good,"i was getting great hours but somewhere through the grapevine HR messed up my time log and used up all my VTO to cover it. i was fired for exceeding the maximum amount of hours i can use. when i confronted human resources about it they simply told me to talk to my manager. long story short, my manager and HR juggled me back and forth until eventually i was escorted out of the building and told to come back next year."
good,"A typical day for me at amazon I come in to work clock in, see what role at my job, then do my best job as possible after a long hard worked 10 hour shift."
good,I would rather work for a company who respect you for what you do for them not how hard they can work for you and give you nothing for you effort.  The company is not a easy place to work.  There always pushing to set new records  and the rates higher.  Just to push the slower employees out the door.
good,"There is very little actual recruiting which takes place as a recruiter at Amazon. Most of the time is spent navigating very poorly designed systems to figure out who you are allowed to contact. "
good,Management is the problem they treat you like you do not understand and talk to people like they are children. The lead  have a lot of favorites and if you not trying to brown nose they will find a way to hinder your job they need more older people in management too many fresh out of College and don't know what they are doing. That's why the turn over rate high.  And let's no talk about HR.
good,Its good if you dont want to be promoted. ALot of flexibilty for those that are in school or just want a part time job. SHift times can make it hard to do anything else with your day
good,"if you worked or work at BFI4 its based on whos butt your kissing. If you dont kiss anyones butt, your fired and you are on the outside looking in. This is not a place for just anyone to be able to join and grow with."
good,"Hard to move up within the company since all positions above a level 1 associate is a full-time position. If you do decide to try to move up in Amazon there's lots of politics that come into play (they vote whether or not you should move up or not) which means there's lots of brown nosing that comes along with trying to move up. They pay is great for an entry level job but positions are limited and unless you really know your stuff and get along with everyone you work with (including your manager), you won't be moving up. Even if you do all that, I've seen Amazon opt to hire outside the company rather than inside."
good,its changes everyday long standing. hours  are long u meet new people everyday they have good opportunity's far as going to school  u really dnt have the time to do much after working a long day there
good,"Not a bad place to work but when they offer you a position that is ""sure to come"" make sure you sign something. This left me suddenly jobless and was hard on my life as a result."
good,"I worked from 10 am- 9:30 pm, management was not that good, it would take days to get a response about healthcare questions or just questions in general. There definitely wasn't enough training to do the required job. They say you'll get hired on full time but you don't. They just keep hiring 100s at a time then they'll let you go early. The type of work I did, which was only helping logistics customers and drivers was so fun. I loved my coworkers, the ones I talked to at least. It's impossible to have a life or even to call off because you only get 20 hours of UPT and that's it. They won't let you call off a whole shift even if it's an emergency. The starting pay is incredibly low too for being a job like it is and getting abuse from the customers and drivers."
good,"Work on the daily was like any other job, where you have your, basic minimum wage experience by performing robotic work contraptions, ideal back and forth walking, and repetitive tasks."
good,Il y a une plutôt bonne ambiance entre intérimaire et aussi avec les embauches.
good,"Nice job but, could use better management. There were really a lot of  holes in their system and in the very slow help center. A major lack of any serious help."
good,"Just like any warehouse had long hours, lots of walking, but ability to move up. Management was decent. Hardest part of the job was continuously making your numbers."
good,"Amazon was a nice place to work. Time went by fast. I would work at this location again if the management was different. I was promised so many times that I could advance, become a trainer or assistant. And I waited months for that to happen. It never did so I quit. There was too much favoritism there, and I don't brown nose"
good,"Ambiente lavorativo dinamico e giovanile. Contratto Mog,buona paga. Contratti lavorativo troppo brevi."
good,"if you need work, and you leave on good terms they will work with you, but you have to watch them.......! the LEFT hand don't know what the RIGHT hand is doing, ( you can leave with notice and they say you just no - call no - show. ) Just keep your own info.....IJS."
good,"Amazon can be a fun workplace, weekly pay is great, and people are great, but job security is horrendous, and getting made permanent is frustrating when others get a permanent job and you do not, when you work harder."
good,fast pace and require to maintain rates regularly.It gets really tiring during the peak hours.Organise games and treats during peak season.provide benefits.
good,It was the nice company it gives me the time to study because in amazon they use to give two weekoff in a  week  so it helps me to prepare for my exam
good,"You do the same thing every single day. During that day you do the same exact thing for 10 hours straight. You turn around and grab some items, scan them, then build a box and put the items in. Attach and scan a label and push it onto the conveyer. Repeat process ~500 times a day. All your work is tracked and so is time off task."
good,Its an ok starting job if youre looking for ok pay. People are a little grumpy and it can be very fast paced at times. They'll mess up your occasiinally?
good,"Travail décevant pour une première expérience "
good,"Amazon as a whole i feel like is a good place to work.  Unfortunately i feel as though middle management is more concerned with meeting the numbers that senior management has standardized.  therefore management has a  ""what have you done for me lately"" mentality towards their associates."
good,disrespectful agency staff. very enjoyable though alot of moving twisting manual handing skills alot of walking you could walk up to 12 miles in one night
good,worked here during peak good pay rate provided you work every hour given otherwise its less. i worked weekend shift due to no other choice and couldn't change it. the training was quite inadequate so learn the rest as you go from other workers. good pay and you do earn it with long hours. free drinks but canteen food poor quality. toilets were dirty and not always working and not big enough for workforce. packing is easy but very boring and tape dispensing machines worn out and often faulty causing loss of production which they blame you for. by the time you learn the job you are laid off in large numbers without warning no matter how hard you work. very dusty and noisey if you work near the machines. when they clean out the packing machines they use airlines and blow cardboard dust everywhere right by where you are working. some management can be disrespectful but on the whole they are ok. water machines were unhygienic. was a good experience but would never work here again.
good,The hardest part of the job is trying to get the money owed to me as they owe me over £1000 the management wasnt great the money was ok
good,Lost my job due to a medical flare up when Amazon's emergency services didn't believe something was wrong with me. They put me on a new position that my body couldn't cooperate with and when I asked to be removed from this task the management would not allow it.
good,"If you want to try working for Amazon all I have to say is good luck."
good,Not really family orientated will fire you if run out of time don't except drs.notes and don't care if family emergency. Make sure you don't use up time you are allotted.
good,"Start with a  team briefing   Then told what job and station you will be working on and told the volume of work for the night. What I learned? No matter how good you are at the job management have their favourites. "
good,Great benefits but they work you very hard. They change mangers often. Very short breaks and long distances to get to break rooms. A lot of favoritism.
good,"Amazon.com is a US based company. I work for chat process where we need to handle queries regarding the product missing,damage,lost etc. Incentive offerd."
good,"Typical day starts with getting to work at 7:30AM. Getting scanners, figuring out what area we are assigned to, doing stretches, hearing the ship goal for the day and if the facility had any safety incidents the previous day. Then off to get carts to pick items for the next ten hours. Though it is manual labor, it is not difficult if you are in decent shape. I actually enjoy picking despite all the horror stories. "
good,The people i work with are great and hard working but the culture of the company needs a lot of work.  I run one of the inbound teams and i have worked everywhere in the building.
good,good job but not good hour for me. is too many stops to do in to many place . its not soo good money like i was told . was working five days a week. thx
good,"Long hours, poor management. Wide group of co-workers, physically demanding. Overall easy, depending on your department. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you meet. Good networking opportunity."
good,Amazon has tremendous growth and opportunity.  The company  does have a history of burning through their employees...hourly associates up to Sr. management.  Work life balance isn't where it needs to be.  Amazon's greatest asset is it's ability to rapidly grow but this also leads to other issues with poor upper management.  If management role is your goal then understand that extremely long hours and sacrifices to family and home life will be necessary to be successful.  Amazon has it's very unique culture and it does take some time to learn that culture and be accepted.
good,"You work long days, doing hard work and management does not appreciate any of it. Area managers only care about themselves because it's their jobs on the line if their team doesn't perform at a high rate."
good,"je trouve ke cette entreprise et bien en elle meme apart un pe dur de marcher pendant 7h dafiler , mai les manager son tre sympa"
good,"During peak season you will be expected to work 12 hours a day 6 days a week. Very strict atmosphere. 30 min lunch, two 15 min  break for a 11 hour shift."
good,I liked working here but i  the whole placed lacked professionalism and order. No one knew who was a manager. From the time i was employed there i had no idea who my manager was because it was never addressed to me and i had issues that i was told that only my manager or supervisor could handle but they were never resolved. This alone made working there terrible.
good,"good pay, very productive and overtime opportunities. management was OK but, had to 'pester' to be heard. long 10 hour shifts dragged and the location of work place was difficult (train times in correlation  to end of shift times was harsh)"
good,"Manager turnover rate is ludicrous, no solid leadership. Terrible HR department. The work itself isn't usually too bad. Hours are all over the place. Pay and benefits will keep you working."
good,"Nobody knows what they want from worker. Say's focus on quality, less on productivity. got kicked out for productivity. Lots of thinks doesnt make any sence. You have all the time scan and do something. Another way someone will report as a lazy person. Any problem they got with you, they solves it only one way Negative feedback."
good,Do not feel comfortable saying anything due to the fact this will be public knowledge and I think its unfair due to the fact they are my current employer
good,"They offered good benefits and paid personal time right from the start."
good,"work before the sun is up to after the sun is down.."
good,"Regardless of position on the floor, Amazon is a fast paced environment that requires multitasking, attention to detail, communication. People are generally easy to get along with, though management could use a tune up. Hardest part of the job is the hours. Overall, its the people who make the job worth going to, not the company."
good,I did not mind the job requirements for Amazon. I was rated at the top of my peers when we had to get our rates. I do feel that the company will help you proceed in the direction you want to go in in your career. I enjoyed the job but I did not care for the way problems were solved inside the company. I do know that now they have improved their staff which improved their production.
good,"Tight schedule every day"
good,"Most of upper management tends to talk down to others and blame their mistakes on each other, it's high-school all over again and its tiring to deal with most of the time. The only real way to make this go from being a job to being a career is to just ""yes sir"" them all the time, even when they are wrong. Other then that its a job, not much else to it, no real challenge most of the time so the days go by slow."
good,Good and nce salary but it is so far away for me and unable to come in timmings and we doesnot get any knowledge and no use it is like an part and time job
good,"This is a fast paced environment with the ability to learn something  new everyday. I think the most enjoyable part of the job was being a part of a team and working together to complete customers shipments. I enjoyed the fact that associates worked together to make things run as smoothly as possible. I also appreciated that we were able to attain medical, dental and vision insurance the day we started,"
good,"They are long days, with short breaks. I learned a lot about the warehouse business. I enjoy the people that I work with, and the different tasks that I have learned. I enjoy staying busy and being active. It seems like we never really had stable managment, just people who did put on a vest and told us what to do, but don't know how to correctly do their job, or knowing the knowledge that needs to be known to lead a team. I enjoyed that they play music to make our day a little easier so we don't get stuck with the thoughts in our head after knowing the routine everyday. The hardest part about my job is getting called mandatory overtime with only 24 hours notice. People have already made plans."
good,My typical day at work consist of unloading trucks and verifying the trucks that come in into our computer system.Sometimes having to call drivers or their carriers directly to find out if they are going to make their appointment times. learning how Logistics in our business works is very interesting and sometimes complicated but i enjoy the challenge. I enjoy the people that i work with on a daily basis.
good,"A Honestly Hard days work, But very rewarding when you think of all the kids and adults alike that will have a great big smile on their faces when they receive their products!!"
good,Its an interesting work environment to be in. You do learn a lot in this job and you work with a lot of different people. Management isn't so great depending what department you are in. The job is very physical and at times it is hard to move up because of how things are ran.
good,Long hours on the floor with little time to have your breaks. Usually have mandatory overtime. Provide little room to compensate for time off.
good,After meeting your daily tasks and shifting through the day/night work can be a little rewarding. The down side is though that you always have to guess when the stipulations for your tasks and workload will undergo change without you being aware of it. At the end of the day you more than likely are viewed as a number rather than an individual.
good,Amazon can be a fun place to work but you have to have a strong work ethic. Management is very strict and is it very hard to move up in the company. They are quick to hire an outside person over promoting within.
good,"The pay and benefits are good but like any job they have their issues, and you should be able to keep your job as long as you can make rate and your time does not go into the negative."
good,"Mind numbing."
good,"Poor Management and Training, good team players, poor job work/life balance, bias options by management. Would not advise anyone to apply for employment. Learned conveyor repair and troubleshooting skills."
good,"Amazon is a fast paced environment so to perform well you must be quick on your feet. while working at Amazon I have learned the procures in an online shipping company and how little regard Amazon has for there products. As an employee I have seen the dysfunctional problems that cause customers like myself to receive damaged items as well as the wrong items all together. The most enjoyable part of this job is staying active and compensation. you literally can not associate with your co-workers at all unless its on your short break. This is a job that becomes boring rather quickly; hence, a lot of employees are burned out for this pay rate."
good,"management is a joke. constantly trying to get people fired. after a year of working their i got my first and only final writeup for TOT. after i asked the manager , he told me he took off tge cart change over etc. he did not . so i have a final with the Tot."
good,"Typically ,every day, one has to concentrate on set targets, which mostly are challenging.  Due many different jobs i have done for Amazon, I have learned to work in a team, work with culturally diverse people, work under pressure."
good,Ok overall great friendships bad managers and even worse hr team and LOA team. agreat if you like standing up for 10+ hours a day.
good,"fast place to work at, hit your targets and have nothing to worry about, wich can be done dont and you get points, to meany points and your out, when i was there i had points for having a picking rote that was hoples sending me all over the warehouse but still had a worning so ended up getting the sack"
good,"Okay job, this job hires and fires at will. only way to secure job is work at the rate of system and no negative hours. blah blah blah blaj blah blah blah"
good,Working at one of their warehouse facilities you will find that the management team is very helpful.the hours are long and be prepared to be on your feet at a fast pace all day long.
good,"Its a regulaf work place enviroment, coworkers are friendly in hard working, management are also friendly always asking associates about your worries and concerns and will always give feedback"
good,"Filled orders to be packed and shipped. 10 hour shift using hand-held scanner to locate and process orders. Management was not really there for you. They were impersonal and distant - the hardest part of the job. They just didn't want to help you out if you had problems."
good,Management did not relate well with non-management personnel or resolve issues with the company employees. The shifts were 10 hours long and were often very physically demanding .The company refused to provide reasonable accommodation for previously sustained injuries.
good,"As a picker, we have minimal supervision.  We use a handheld electronic device which tells us what item to pick and where it is located.  The Amazon Fulfillment Centers are huge so be prepared to walk."
good,"A typical day at Amazon involves cheerleading stand up meetings where our goals are updated to match them against team members within the building and elsewhere.  Within a week you are expected to be proficient.  "
good,very inconsistent management. work environment can be unhealthy due to all the dust and lack of ventilation systems. as well as there's many faces to be met and friendships to build.
good,It was really long 10 hour days and required anywhere from 10-20 miles of walking. It was a demanding job that required a lot. The people there where nice and worked together as much as they could. Management was helpful when faced with problems. The most enjoyable part of work was when they had meals brought in our music brought in for the staff
good,"Typically your work depends on the working environment around you. If you team is good, then your job goes as you expect. If otherwise, then you need to do something for yourself."
good,every day u meet new people diferent personalities!! A good work place with verry unexperienced and bad management.And the only thing that it counts at the end of the day is ''numbers''.
good,"Although the atmosphere is fun and relaxed, the management team tends to focus more on numbers rather than the associates' well being. Too many times, I have seen several GREAT employees walk out simply because the management does not listen to the associates concerns."
good,Aprendi como vigilante a ter empatia e fiz muitos amigos a gerencia ficava muito a desejar em relaçao aos seus funcionarios dia mais dificil era sempre dias de feriados  e a parte mais agradavel era quando trabalhava com as pessoas dos orgaos em que eu ficava
good,"pas de motivation car favoritisme des managers."
good,"steady hours, Horrible hr reps, unrealistic standards work wise. Good benefits such as insurance. gets to be very long and boring shifts work also gets old fast."
good,"The day is long and filled with hard work, it is great for people that like that sort of thing. I personally wouldn't call it the best job but the benefits are pretty good and the pay keeps me there."
good,"it is nice place to work and makes u hard working , getting  good experience and improving skills.. it is ten hours aday 40 hours a week.it was longs day but with benefits..."
good,My biggest issue was lack of advancement. New managers came in from the outside and were trained by me. Worked there for 4 years
good,"Amazon has great pay and benefits but it is a very physically demanding job, with long hours. There is not a good work/life balance. Management changes constantly, and there are ""clichés"" within each department. There are some very nice people there but no time to form friendships, The most difficult part of the job is being on your feet for 10 hours."
good,"everything sucks from work expectations, managment, pay, and benefits. also if you're expecting to progress, HA. well unless you're a favorite. And it just isnt one Amazon its multiple"
good,"- you learn something new everyday"
good,"simple work very easy to pick up, understanding management and co-workers, although undesirable work schedules and routines, payroll yet insufficient."
good,They give you alot of run around. You are always learning new things. It is a very fast paced job with alot of heavy lifting. I love the job but it is time to look into a career.
good,Amazon is a place for people with no family no personal life no other obligations other than Amazon. The pay is great but the long hours and the way they treat their employees is no compensation.
good,"This job was fun and also demanding. The hours are long and the IT setup is extremely tedious and difficult. The hardest part of the job was being at home, the temptation to interact with with family was challenging."
good,"The job was okay, it was a temp job or seasonal job and you work hard. work early hours and night hours. day shift and night shift."
good,"A typical day at work was 'Your speed doesn't matter, safety and accuracy. But, you have to do this amount, otherwise you get written up, so it does matter.' The days of that you have? You don't have off. There was a serious lack of communication from the management level, conflicting stories and you basically had no life outside of it. It takes an hour to find parking and 2-60 minutes to get out of the parking lot when you leave. When you were doing the 11 hour shifts, you basically had no time to yourself."
good,People are great to work for. Management could not care less. Management fails capitalize on past experiences. You are just a number here and have no say if you are on the chopping block
good,"If you're looking for work and need a job, Amazon Fulfillment Centers are a good place to start. Competitive pay, good benefits, and reasonable hours."
good,I'd rather not just be prepared to work long hours very hard. They pay good so if you are used to this kind of work. I don't feel like telling you more just experience it for yourself.
good,I would say if you are looking for a place to work and go no where then this is your place.You work hard and don't get anywhere.
good,"amazon is a good place to work if you don't have children and a family and if you are looking to start out your first job"
good,"Amazon is a great job, but not where I want to be as a career.  They care more about production and not enough about the employees.  The lack of respect towards entry level employees from upper management is bad too."
good,uma empresa com poucas dinamica mais em uma area boa de trabalhor
good,"not a bad place to work if your face fits and you brown nose management to progress your career within amazon."
good,"This job was bitter sweet for me. While I loved many of my co workers and peers, the management was shaky and under established. The reasons in which you can lose your job depend entirely on if the system functions properly and if the items we have are properly located and delivered. Job security is the biggest flaw at this job. The week I was released at least 4 other employees were released and they also had an HR team that was incompetent with  paperwork I delivered twice. Needs a newly structured hierarchy of management."
good,"Providing Customer Service to individuals on a variety of situations. including:"
good,"Crazy work days with long 10 hour shifts working from 4:30-300AM"
good,"I found that the work here is easy but very repetitive, which is fine, if you don't mind that for 10 hours a day. The pay can be worth it if your pay doesn't get screwed up. However, during ""peak season"" (November - February) they hire thousands of people each month at each warehouse and in order to compensate for that they rewrite they're system to cause the numbers that inventory counters get to not match up with the numbers they are expected to get. This results in a quality write-up. After 3 of these quality write-ups. Your assignment is terminated (fired)."
good,"it was a seasonal job . it was tiresome scanning all those packages and putting them on the crates , sort of felt like i was doing a puzzle but it wasn't so bad"
good,"My work schedule is from 6:30 PM to 5 AM, Saturday through Tuesday. When I get to work, typically I clock in with my badge or if I am a little early I will sit in the break room. then we meet with our team leader, we stretch, and we are told to go to our respective, assigned work stations for that particular day."
good,Management does not treat employees with respect. Job advancement is based on who is liked the most by management. GM does not listen to employees nor is there action taken when necessary for issues. All about numbers.
good,The work is physically demanding. Pay was low. Overtime is mandatory. Felt like a robot. Breaks were short because it took time to walk from warehouse to break room.
good,Amazon is an overall great place to work for however they do not pay the amount of money a person is work and the management there with the exception of one is an absolute joke
good,"There is an expectation of dedicating entire life to job and offering 24/7/365 availability. At the same time you are able to contribute to almost any group that isn't a secret project, and if you can make something better even outside of your normal purview your contribution will be welcomed."
good,"A typical day Amazon goes as follows"
good,"The work is hard. The people you work with are great, however the management is only out for themselves. Pay is decent for a warehouse job but not that great."
good,"Supervisors were unfair, management was okay, nights were long and were not fun at all, but the pay was great but working night shifts takes its toll hard."
good,"Amazing company for someone starting out or between johs."
good,If you like to walk at a very swift pace for 10hrs a night 4 to 5 days a week this is the job for you. Seems like if you buddy up with the right supervisor or lead you can get a chill job. As a picker to keep your rate up from the time you clock in you have to move swiftly throughout a warehouse the size of about 3 to 4 football fields for 10 hours with a 30 min lunch break & 2 15 min breaks that are actually 10 min. Would be a great first job for someone.
good,"Good company as far as the hour and pay for a part/full time work."
good,"I learned how to work diligently in a team, met great people, and learned to work fast. Most enjoyable part of the job was the breaks we got. two 15minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch. The hardest part was standing, bending, and lifting all day long. Everything was soo far apart the breaks were a lot shorter than they tell you."
good,"Amazon is what is it. It is a very fast paced job that requires a large amount of self motivation, drive, and willingness to adapt to constant change. It can be difficult, frustrating, rewarding, and unforgiving. This is a job where anyone can be replaced, ANYONE, that includes your leadership. Their turnover rate is incredibly high, and has no sign of lowering anytime soon. but with that turnover, if you succeed and prove yourself valuable, you can advance. Don't expect to get any higher than a PA without a degree or several years in a PA role for the company. Amazon is customer driven, not worker driven. You are not the priority here, the customer is, something to keep in mind when dealing with frustrations. You will work overtime, in some cases, what seems to be unfair amounts. It is all for demand, because at the end of the day management has a job. As stated above Amazon is what it is, take or leave it."
good,"The job is really mundane but you do feel supported by management and the coaching staff."
good,"Everyday we would start standups(group) with stretches and a safety tip.We were given a plan to shipout (volume) for the day.As shipclerks,it was our responsility to ensure the proper staffing for a fast start.Most co-workers would rise to there expectations as long they felt included as a team member.I would say the hardest part of the job was not to over staff or under staff the dock,and long shifts(7:am-7pm I would have to say the most enjoyable part of my job was having a good crew to work with  and volutary overtime."
good,"During most of my two years at Amazon, I have been proud to say I worked there and had an optimistic view of my long term career. I have come to believe more recently that there is a culture at Amazon that favors the newer associates and discourages veteran ""Amazonians"" from staying with the company."
good,"I enjoyed working here, the only downfall are the short breaks. My job was fast paced and I enjoyed it up until they started laying people off during the holidays."
good,"I am not especially happy talking abot amazon work. Many people are not friendly, feeling higher than simple agency employer. Also all employers which have target feel pressure always work more faster, better and etc. Amazon have pluses, but not more. For example free voichers for dinner, free coffe, cookies, ice cream if day are hot or especially busy."
good,great benifits extremly hot environment management seemed to care less about employees work hours very complicated for single mother
good,Hard work.  Staff are helpful.  Management not so much.  Several quick meetings per day.  30 minutes lunch breaks means 30 minutes...not 31.  Very fast paced environment.  No time to fool around.
good,Typical day at work is hassle free. Learned how to deal with critical situations. Management is not good. Co-workers are good. Less transparency in management decisions.
good,"Say goodbye to your social life if you work for Amazon. The workload is intense, but you will learn a lot and burn out fast. Get in and then get out!"
good,"I enjoyed working at Amazon but was released due to an illness causing me to gain points, a system I do not agree with. "
good,Days started early at 6:45 am during peak season. Goals and rates were set as well as instructions for departments at stand up meetings. Management was difficult at times when rates were not met due to lack of space for items and employees were sometimes brushed off and told to just continue working. Other employees working the job were friendly and very helpful to newcomers which created a great team environment. The job was physically demanding but with time it became easier on the body and mind.
good,"Worked all the time, mandatory.  Management talked to you like you were less than human, and even yelled, screamed at me.  As production slowed, it seemed as if they pushed people to quit because they no longer needed they.  I still have friends that work there and love it.  Just my experience."
good,"The call center was, at one time, a dream job. Sure, getting yelled at by customers daily isn't ideal, but the atmosphere and freedom to do what you needed to do in order to resolve their issues was empowering. Since the new Director of US CS has taken over, however, most of those freedoms have been taken away and outsourcing for Retail has begun. His new vision has literally turned Amazon CS into every other call center out there... and that's a shame."
good,"Amazon is a place of favoritism depending on who you were buddies with is where you stood in the company the 'nobodies' were basically pawns which the company did as they pleased with. I was hired with a group of about 20 people by the time I left the establishment there were only about 2 of us left. The days were tedious and if you for some reason happen to take a 2 min breather you had a PA down your back threating you with write ups. The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving, everyday was like a release from a cruel and unusual punishment. Non-the-less everyone worked fairly well in the work place, bottom line employees that is, helping one another out making the best of what we had. It was definitely slave work regardless of the pay."
good,over all it was  good i learn to pack and inspected items and work with others the hours was good and was a OK work interment to work in
good,"I began as a temp working as a temp for 6 months.  While i was a temp there i quickly took on more responsibility guiding a group of 8-10 people to do the best job possible.  I got along well with other employees there,  and quickly became managements right hand.  I then proceeded to become a full time employee thru amazon continuing to progress and help others progress as well.  My time there I worked as a tier 1 employee but did a tier 3 job, I did this for another 8 months.  I had full intentions of staying at amazon but with the lack of management my job became increasingly more difficult.  I tried to advance in my field managing the 8-10 people I worked with but management had no desire in paying me tier 3 pay as I had done the job for tier 1 (and temp) pay for over a year.   Now about what was hard about my job,  I would have to say it was the fact that when something went wrong I was fully responsible for it but when things went great (which it went great a lot) I received little to no recognition for if, as well as when I had a problem with an employee not doing there job or not doing it correctly I was unable to convince management to help me correct the issue as well as i was unable to correct the situation myself because management refused to give me the authority to do so.  This resulted in employees doing what the wanted when they wanted and me being held responsible for their actions.  Granite situations like this seldom occurred  but it did occur.  But thru all of this I continued to keep a positive attitude and enjoy my job the best I could (giving the circumstances)"
good,"Work was not difficult"
good,"Amazon tries to be awesome but tends to get mired down in the paperwork.  Management is often entirely uninvolved in anything going on but likes to manage aggregate metrics.  Additionally, they will ask as much as they can from every individual for every hour of every day until you say no, then they will use shame techniques to make you do more."
good,At Amazon you experience a fast paced work enviroment that is challenging and rewarding.  Multi-tasking is key to being successful.  Amazon has taught me so many new skill sets which is key for my professional growth.
good,"A typical day at day was 10 hours long. Managers were always transferring, or leaving.  Most of my co-workers were friendly and helpful.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up the amount of energy  to make daily and weekly production rates. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing all the product."
good,"My current position, as Ship Clerk makes me responsible for every shipment that leaves the warehouse. It is a position that is weighted by high expectations from senior operations staff. The main duties of this job are to, effectively and efficiently; depart the packages, as prepared by other departments. To do this I use Dock Management Systems to control the flow of the entire operation. I am responsible for any delays with trailers arriving and departing and it is my duty to ensure that that no ‘Critical Pull Times’ are missed. This position includes liaison with external logistics companies and all other Amazon Fulfillment centers in Europe. I lead a small team of trained individuals to make sure the final steps of the warehouse’s involvement with each shipment is handled with the utmost professionalism and importance."
good,You are pretty much just considered a number in the warehouse and not thought of as much more than that. The pay was decent but management and everyone I believe could care less about people individually it was all about you production.
good,"in typical day of picker/packer your duties are to follow the scanner systems and picking items, placing them on correct conveyor belts for pacing, notifying missing and damaged items. "
good,"A typical day at Amazon requires one to be on their feet all day. I learned a lot from working here and also through the people I've met. There are many types of people here, you may meet your best friend here, or a significant other. The hardest part of the job is the physical demands. If you can get past that aspect of doing manual labor for 10 hours a day, then you will fit in fine."
good,"Amazon is an extremely fast paced, frenetic, chaotic, team work oriented, talented employees, innovative, smart place to work. Amazon is growing and they understand the importance of investing in new technologies and resources yet do not invest in the employees much as a whole. This is a HIGHLY customer-centric place to work, and not much attention given to importance of retaining good employees or work-life balance. Management is extremely cut-throat and it brags that most of the people we work with are here for 1 year or less (that is because as quickly as they are hiring people, they are getting rid of ""low performers"" who actually would do alright in a normal environment. It is a dog-eat-dog environment and everyone is out to cover themselves. It really doesn't seem this way until you've been there at least 6 months. Despite all this negativity, it's a really cool place to work and I really like my coworkers, who are all by the way, super-smart people also. I've never met so many smart people in one company."
good,The co-workers are good and I learned to work as a team with them.  The hardest part of the job was that the new managers that were new to the company wanted to run it their way when we should be running it Amazon way.
good,Working for Southwire was a great experience. I would come in to work with a good attitude and leave with one. Everyone there did what they were supposed to do and their jobs done. Just wish management would've worked with me when i was in difficult situations.
good,"Targets were hard to hit if you weren't used to that kind of work some of the management were a bit snobby and could be physically demanding. But I made so many friends there, most people were happy to talk while you worked, you could have a laugh while working and the pay wasn't amazing but it was above min wage for over 21s no matter how old you are (I was 18 & 19 while working there)."
good,"If you're stocking, you're literally running close to your entire day. There's no organization of the warehouse; new items get shelved wherever room can be found for something. This results in everyone running like a madman trying to find empty room for new items, and also to find products that have been ordered to get them out. Management knew the system was counterproductive, but still held it against the hourly employees instead of trying to find ways of fixing it so that overall productivity could reach the heights it was, truly, capable of."
good,"You have to be at your desk and ready to take a contact as soon as your shift start otherwise you will be marked a half a point. every second of your day is accounted for. "
good,Fast paced atmosphere - customer driven environment.  Dedicated to improvement and customer issues.
good,"Management could use so retraining in how to treat there employees"
good,Getting Past Teir3 is very hard unless you have some college and or kiss a lot of butt
good,"Get to work, clock in and sort different items for 10 hours. Clock out and go home.  I learned that I don't like standing in one place all day. The management were polite but not sincere when they spoke to you. The co-workers were awesome people. The hardest part was just standing all day and not being recognized for a job well done."
good,"good company to work for, it's just too much turn over, but that's the way its designed. the hardest part of the job was making the hourly rate. the company changed the app on the computer so that you would not know what your rate really was. i really enjoyed making the rate."
good,Very simple.Clock in.Go to stand up meeting.Walk at the speed of light for 10 hours.If your a picker that is.Wondering all day what your going to get wrote up on next or walked out the door.Listen to leadership tell you how to do the job they cant even do.But very few can.Maybe 3 I know of can out of 100.Co workers are awesome people.At least we are all on the same page.Hardest part of the day is clocking in.Best part is clocking out.Over all the place needs alot of common sense.Maybe there is hope someday.
good,"staying on feet"
good,February-September is not too bad. October-January is rough.
good,this job was okay no room for advancement. strict on the job rules and regulations not really ideal for a long term job. good for warehouse experience.
good,"Hard work in a warehouse with variable temperatures. Co-workers are generally easy to get along with."
good,"Decent job but horrible management. lots of hours, mandatory overtime."
good,"Responsible for maintaining accurate stock records and schedules.  Selected products for specific routes according to pick sheets.  Unloaded, picked, staged and loaded products for shipping. Rotated stock by code and receiving date. Followed proper selection procedures as established by the company. Installed protective bracing, padding and strapping to prevent shifting and damage to items during transport.  Worked at a rapid pace to meet tight deadlines.  Removed pallets, freezer boxes and damaged products from returning trailers.  Operated powered lift trucks, floor sweepers, pallet jacks and forklifts safely, with a 0% incident rate.  Used propane forklift to load trailer at warehouse.  Assembled product containers and crates.  Loaded flat bed by forklift and hand truck.  Cleared damaged items and loaded freight."
good,"Excellent place to work at and lead by extremely talented operational heads outside India, but the other factors do play a vital role after a point of time. It indeed is one of the fastest growing company and along the way it has gradually changed its basic priciples in their local offices, which isn't right."
good,"the work in Amazon is fairly straight forward with little complications, the shifts are long and monotonous."
good,"A typical day: listen to stand up meeting, prep your scanner, go to assigned dept, start working, and avoid being off task."
good,I use to love it. When some time goes by you will see how it's a dawg eat dawg world..People will turn on you like a drop of a hat.
good,A typical day consists of picking items to reach my target. The hardest part is working the night shift 4 nights a week. I enjoy being regarded as a competent and reliable worker and being turned to for special duties such as rushed orders etc. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationship I have with my co-workers and receiving high scores at the end of the work week.
good,The job was not what I thought it would be and they don't really help the workers they no longer work with people that has special needs no more waivers so if your not I n perfect conditions don't try n work there.
good,"I works Wednesday through Sunday from seven in the morning to six at night.The hours were actually decent, but the breaks couldn't come soon enough. With driving an order picker, I couldn't make it from the charging zone to the front of the plant during our fifteen minute breaks, due to all the traffic in the charge zone."
good,"Even though you had a specific job title, you never knew what you'd be walking into every morning. I learned that no matter how hard you worked to show that you were eager and capable of taking on much more responsibility, it was never good enough. It was all about the brown nosing and befriending the management staff. The hardest part of working there is that you were never allowed to be yourself.  There were too many contradictions and favoritism.  The best part of the job was being able to talk to your peers, find things in common with one another and making new friends."
good,I like to advance more and amazon doesn't have what im looking for.
good,I worked there during the holidays and their ways of communication are horrible.  Their productivity expectations are ridiculous.
good,It is an amazing place to work with. A person who can prove their competencies can grow very quick.
good,"Had real learning and fun in speaking to people, understanding the requirement, mentoring, training and utilizing all the opportunity available."
good,"The job is physically demanding, but not mentally.  Very clean facility.  Work goals are basically unattainable.  Example is on a daily basis, only about 5% reach the rate goal.  They contend that safety is the number one issue, but it's really pushing employees to achieve the plan rate...which leads to less safety."
good,"Good Christmas Filler, shame there was no long term prospects"
good,"It was physically strenuous place that challenged me everyday. I would come in and stretch with coworkers then proceed to my assigned floor and stock merchandise. I would often be asked to do other tasks around the building like unloading semis or packing up bought merchandise. The management on my shift was not horrible but they often failed to be involved with the current days issues and challenges. I learned that I am stronger than was known, as well as a great communicator. The hardest part of the job was meeting expectations when the shift before mine did not complete theirs. We often had to cover the work that was left over plus the work that was required of us to finish. I really enjoyed working with other individuals and exceeding expectations."
good,"A typical day at Amazon can last between 9 and 12 hours per day, almost the entire time was spent answering phones and talking to customer. I felt that the management wasn't always on the same page with each other. You'd ask a question and it would often day days to get an answer, often times the answer was I can't discuss it with you. The coworkers in general were pretty nice but, there was no real time to develop any professional relationships. The hardest part of the job was dealing with repetitiveness day in and day out. Snack carts were the best part of the job."
good,"Long day's."
good,"Learning about the Report Analyzing."
good,"As a Problem Solver I was in charge of first line errors occurring primarily in the receiving department. I corrected pricing, description, and image discrepancies that conflicted with actual product to fix the online website. I handled problems in receiving, stocking, stowing, and picking of merchandise."
good,We work to get our customers shipments out on time everday I work to stock the selves.
good,"It is a great job starting out- however it is not meant to be a career by any means. Decent pay if anything. A great first job, temp job or occasional advancement."
good,Working here the hours were very long and hard. I honestly did not enjoy this job at all.
good,I loved this company but it has an issue of corporate arrogance.
good,It was a very cool job alot of walking but it was ok. They need longer breaks because u are there for 10 hours a day an on ur feet for the hole 10 hours. The pay was ok but u didnt have no job security there.
good,"The large volume of merchandise that is processed at an Amazon Fulfillment Center is amazing. In order to get a quick delivery to the customer, everyone in the facility works at a rapid pace to keep the production line moving rapidly from picking the merchandise, putting the orders into boxes, labeling, and putting on trucks for delivery."
good,Only hired on as a temp employee. 10 hours a day 4 days a week. Very little wiggle room on schedules.
good,"putting away merchandise . every other week guiding a team of 35 employees to where to work as to get the job done as efficently as possible. i have recently put in to be a trainer. manager said i would be a good trainer. all these things are good, and gradifying but with no compensation attached to it. management is good. at least in my department. i have a good boss. co-workers are good as well, i surround myself with people that have a good work ethic and that are respectful of others. i really have no time for users and losers. hardest part of the job is company overstuffs the warehouse as so it is frustrating to do job as efficently as could be done. most enjoyable part is the people and my boss's."
good,"Good learning experience lot of work, helped increase work quality, efficiency. good work culture. Taught professionalism"
good,"I would show up to work, clock in and go to the morning meeting. When the meeting ends we would look at a paper and see what and where we were working. I worked either as a stower or on dock line. If I was stowing then I would go to the location that I was assigned to. I would pick up a cart and scan the items off the cart and into a bin. If I was working on the dock line I would either check in the boxes, unload the truck, and/or open the boxes and sort them onto different pallets. We would get two 15 minute breaks and one half hour lunch. After working our 10 hour shift we clocked out and went home.     "
good,"typical day at work required mme to solve every problem an order had before it gets sent out the door. It is a new plant not even a year old, the management could have been better they had 21-22 year olds in management position that wasnt properly experienced for it. my fellow co-workers and i had a great relationship. the hardest part of the job was always right before a CPT (critical pull time) thats when you would see most problems."
good,The targets are kind off hectic. I did not get to learn much about what i was doing but got an opportunity to work on different projects and learn other things apart from the actual process but it is completely a fun place to work with. The hardest part of the job would be few leads there and the most enjoyable ones are the people. 
good,Amazon is a wonderful company to work for if you just finished high school and do not intend to study further.
good,"Amazon.com is a place where you will learn a lot not only about online retailers, but also about what is important to you. Amazon will take everything that you give it. If you want to work 100 hours a week, they will take it...you have to set boundaries or you will burn out. If you can do this, you'll be fine."
good,"You are crammed into a small cubical and have to answer the phone constantly. You are given the mandatory breaks and during lunch or break you can not stay at your desk and are forced into other areas where you have very little privacy unless you leave. However 30 minutes isn't enough time. You are allowed bathroom breaks for 3 minutes outside your 2 10min break and lunch. This is a good place to work if you are young, can manage to make people stop talking when they are upset."
good,8 hour shifts with 20 min lunch
good,"The job was not hard and the income was not bad, the job was just a temp job so I didn't get the chance to explore certain opportunities!"
good,Pick and pack boxes to be later shipped out. I learned the order process from order fulfillment to shipment. Management was there but at most times non-existant. Co-workers were there but communication lacked because it was more of a solo job. Hardest part of the job was standing and doing same thing over and over again. Most enjoyable part of the job was leaving at the end and feeling free when exiting the building.
good,"The hours were okay, but waking up at 5.30 to go to work at 7 isn't great. The agency who hired me to work at Amazon were helpful in organizing holiday pay and other things, however, I'd often get to work and be sent home instantly due to the fact there was no work, I think there should've been better communication between management and workers. I got along with most of my work colleagues and noticed that there was often a friendly work environment."
good,"Learned to take charge went it's needed, co-workers were great and always had a good laugh with them. Hardest part was getting motivated for work when starting at 6am, although I managed to learn to get motivated."
good,as a employer I thought the company In all were just OK I loved working there but job security is not very good seems all you the in the place is a no
good,"Work at an excedingly fast pace. No job security, mostly temporary positions."
good,A long day as a lead with working 12 hours a day and having to deal with management lacking a lot of communication between management and co-workers. Best part of the job is the co-workers. Employees are great to work with.
good,The positions at Amazon are fairly easy and the fast-pace is not a
good,"job was very exciting and fun in the beginning. Job can be very stressful and can be discouraging due to the fact that you try to keep up but every week they come to you with a negative due to your quality, rate or something else. They don't seem to help you build yourself up. Hard for the real workers to get ahead. They don't offer sick days for your children and the workers only get 2 medical excuses per year. There is allot of favoritism. Some people love this place, but i say its the ones who are not a tier 1. Managers can be disrespectful."
good,"I worked here twice, both times through integrity staffing. They will tell you that there are chances to be converted to amazon employees but I wasn't so lucky. I worked in shipping either sorting packages, stacking packages onto pallets or loading trucks. Management could have been better. Problems could be avoided but they take no action to prevent them and barely do anything to fix them when they occur. During peak season they have so many people working there (mostly pickers and packers) that there is literately nowhere to park. I had to walk about 5 minutes to get to the entrance. Kind of crazy to have 2000 pickers, 1000 packers and only 20 to 40 people in shipping. Not to say it was always bad there , they did order pizzas and other special food for us. They provided us with free Gatorade all summer and fresh fruit. Just don't count on it becoming a permanent job. I left secure, but lower paying jobs twice to work there and they left me unemployed 2 days before Christmas, Both times. I will not go back."
good,"The management like to pick favorites and those favorites are more likely to advance rather than the person who worked there much longer. I loved working with my co-workers. As a matter of fact, they were the glue to my employment while I was there. The job was easy if you are a fast a worker and like to stay busy. If you don't like to work, don't work there. We had lots of fun on day to day basis while staying busy."
good,The people and fellow co-workers were easy to get along with and hardworking but the management was horrible. The stated rules were changed daily so you never knew if you would get fired for doing what they told you to do the day before
good,i liked it for a while but it was to much time away from my faimly and my home responsabillity
good,"Work wasn’t bad, good environment with my co-workers made the day go by fast but the management sucked. Definitely favoritism with certain workers. But overall not bad."
good,In my case I was just hired as Holiday help and was laid off very quickly. However they let me go on good terms and I can reapply at any time in the future/
good,"If you need good insurance and want some flexibility with your schedule, Amazon is a good place to work temporarily. But there is always drama and management does treat the hard workers well."
good,cant take restroom breaks cant take a normal break because the job cuts into break time supervisor talk mean bascailly threaten you with your job some days its so hot we come outside wet
good,"Driving for Amazon is hard work. Drivers have to be able to not only navigate a vehicle that's as large as an RV, but to get in and out of a vehicle with no step for the drivers, and do this over 150-190 times a shift. Also, having drivers loaded with over 350-400 packages are killing drivers out on the road."
good,Management very unprofessional uses foul language. Picks and chooses who they want to advance and shows favoritism. 10 or 12 hour working shifts also you have the option to pick up shifts if they are available.
good,"It doesn't matter what you were doing before, the management is not interested to help you to learn more. The good points are the job flexibility, it's allowed 1 shift swap each week, and the overtime during the peak times."
good,Non mi sono trovata bene per poter dare un giudizio positivo
good,Trabajo entretenido compañerismo  ganas de superación y desarrollo aunque muchas horas extras sin pagar
good,Moat ppl are temps. They let go easily. If you under perform a few days in a row they fire you. They dont respect your need for restroom breaks. I was fired when i twisted my ankle.
good,"Unfair working conditions, clear favoritism in the work place. States that if you feel unsafe to deliver a package you don’t have to deliver it but management will call you and try to guilt you into completing the delivery."
good,"Man muss bestimmte ""Zahlen"" bringen. Wer das vorgegebene Soll nicht schafft wird zum Gespräch geholt"
good,"Il managment che decide di non rinnovarti il contratto non  ti parla di persona , nè motiva la decisione..."
good,"This is coming from having worked in one of their fulfillment centers. Typically work 4/10s except during peak/prime week(expect lots of overtime). Benefits are great for the job. Decent pay depending on where you live/your cost of living. I've had great managers that I still keep in contact with and I've also had horrible managers that don't have any people skills whatsoever. The hardest part of the job is the monotony, no matter what department you're in it gets old eventually. Best thing I took for granted was how easy it is to relocate if needed. As long as you are in good standing and the destination fulfillment center approves your transfer you can pack your stuff up and transfer."
good,"Amazon has its issues just like any other company, however you can’t beat their benefits. The health insurance alone is well worth it! I quit back in 2015 and swore I would never work for Amazon again but the Health benefits every where else doesn’t even come close."
good,"Frustrating at not knowing about changes until the last minute."
good,"The manager to employee ratio is very skewed.  many employees don't pull their weight because they can hide from supervisors.  The incentives to work there, however, are very good, it is just difficult when everyone isn't putting in 100 percent."
good,"Loved the work and the challenges that I was given to accomplish by going above the set rate per hour. People where friendly for the most part. "
good,"La direction est a l'écoute, toujours la quand on a besoins."
good,You have some managers that took personal interest which I deeply appreciated but personally I was feeling expendable. I worked the night shift which was fine but it wasn’t always comfortable temperature wise. (They tell you that 9/10 the weather outside is the weather inside) They do provide complementary water and popsicles for electrolyte replacement which was greatly needed and appreciated
good,Amazon gets in their own way.  Micromanaging is a real issue.  They provide great benefits and pay is adequate.   The management team in the front office does not understand the tasks or what variables that a Associate encounters
good,"Management will ever make your job easier or will make your job a living nightmare."
good,Must have a second job to survive.  lose a lot of good workers because they rather have a 35-40 hr job.  So you can have a good pay but if you don't offer the hours what good is it.
good,One thing aboiut Amazon is especially they dont have any dress code. Literally you can wear anything you want to the office. Thats the best thing and the Leave policy is one of the best in Industry.
good,Was a very strict work environment and the lunch breaks were too heavily regulated. But the managers there weren't very experienced in in managing large groups of people.
good,The hours were hard to come by. A large workforce in a small side warehouse. Hours were put up very early morning and first come first serve. Hours were not what we were told during interview and as a flex worker it was hard to get more than a couple shifts.
good,When I first started the culture was pretty good and my manager was consistent in giving feedback for performance improvement but after 6 months the management team became more worried about moving forward and culture changed to more about pushing volume than anything else
good,I worked four 10 hour days with two 30min breaks. I would sometimes have to come in 5-6 days for mandatory overtime. No phones allowed and if you were driving the machines you were in silence for 10 hours. Management was all over the place and didn't really care for employees.
good,"Every single time off request must be taken out of a time bank that each employee has, regardless of type of absence or reasons for the absence including injuries sustained at work, and if you do not have the time to cover the absence regardless of if the absence is necessary or not, you are instantly terminated. This includes unpaid time, which is absolutely ridiculous since they always have more than enough employees on the floor at any given time so they are not hurting for productivity by any means."
good,"Six or 7 months of 12 hour long days (59 hours a week mandatory) with no breaks or vacations allowed during much of that time. The position was very stressful. At first, I loved it because I was constantly moving, then it began wearing me down and effecting my sleep. It was good for a short time, but that many months with that many mandatory hours was too hard on my body."
good,Nobody there will help each other in times of need. Most people there are selfish including managers and they don’t give second chances to those who deserve it.
good,"You spend many hours working that you don't really have any time to do anything when you come home. Only during your days off."
good,"Just  be ready to work,mind your own business and if there is room fir growth ensure to do so because it is an environment to grow with the company alongside team mates"
good,"Ambiente di lavoro gradevole, l'aspetto formale della relazione contrattuale di lavoro è ineccepibile, concretamente siamo gestiti in linea con quanto proposto in fase di assunzione."
good,Placing Amazon orders for multiple items into the relevant packaging and ensuring a high level of quality control. Shift pattern was 4 days on 3 days off working 10 hour shifts.
good,Amazon is a pretty stressful place to work  especially during seasonal period. As you have to work very fast and targets are almost unrealistic and tiring. But it's worth the pay for the hard work you do as tiring as it is Most enjoyable part of the job are the breaks and the people.
good,Amazon was a fun place to work at with horrible work schedules..they did not practice what they preached in all aspects but other wise great company to work for...
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the work challenge and met it very successfully, great feeling of customer satisfaction, however, I was very disappointed in the management of the DAE3 facility in Hazleton PA. Very poor support, ignored basic employee safety procedures, Especially toward driver safety."
good,"This place had many expectations to be met and some that couldn't be fulfilled such as getting certain orders out by specific times. Constantly working against faulty equipment, fixing other's mistakes, and body strain. The most enjoyable part was the people."
good,Amazon is a great place to work if you are ready to hustle and put in the hours. Everyone I worked with was super bright and driven and the scope and scale of the things you'll work on is massive. The work life balance (as reported a ton in the media) is not very good and I wouldn't recommend it as a place to work if you have a lot of obligations at home or outside of your job.
good,"Having Amazon on your resume will do wonders for your career but they know that and count it as part of your compensation. You'll learn a lot but since it's almost all proprietary technology, it won't translate well in other companies. If you can last for 2 years here, you'll never be short of opportunities."
good,Virtual work was a new experience and takes a strong dedication to succeed. Your mind set has to maintain the same standards as any other job. Other than your attire nothing should be treated differently.
good,"La giornata di lavoro è bella movimentata, ma non impossibile di fare."
good,They didn't take Dr notes for days off and lack of management and training. people bad attitude and manners.  I wouldn't want to work there again in my life
good,"Working at Amazon seasonally wasn't bad, but it wasn't exactly easy either. If you're a driver you will be let go shortly after Christmas, with little to no warning. Make sure you have a plan."
good,"les cadres sont censés être accompagnés lors de leur début après une période de formation (efficace et dense). ce n'a pas été le cas, du moins pas comme je l'avais attendu en comparant les expériences de certains collègues."
good,If the culture they sell was more instituted in all Amazon locations and the workers were valued and actively appreciated and listened to it would go a long way. Some locations have no opportunity to go full time unless you're willing to relocate or move in to upper management and that is quite discouraging to a hard working employee. It seems a lot like a road going nowhere.
good,"There is no job security at all. I enjoyed the people I worked with. We worked well together. We were told we were made permanent employees,  but that wasn't the case."
good,"Management has no idea what they are doing most of the time. You have no life outside of work due to constantly working overtime. "
good,"The overall company is great, the site I worked at had a lot of management and cultural issues. Expect to work hard, but you are compensated well. Lots of opportunity for advancement if you are willing to put in the work. They will critique you on everything and small mistakes will get you fired. Expect to work the worst shifts first and it takes a really long time to get onto the best shifts."
good,"Although Amazon is brand name, the work culture is definitely stressful and fast paced. You are on your own to figure out solution of a problem. No initial training and handover but thrown into the ocean of their internal wiki. No set process or standard and everything is so scattered that you will feel almost lost. Money wise also they don't pay as per their interview level. There are certain benefits like work from home, onsite TT, fruits and beer tap but on personal life it is stress ful."
good,Laid off no warning. I went in for work they just laid us off with no warning right after the holiday it’s kind of crazy but I guess that’s how corporate places work right 🤦🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
good,They messed up my pay 2 and now I am in the hole with my bank I call but my checks are bouncing from them Amazon. They need to figure something out and fast
good,Most of the staff is replaced rapidly. A lot of the work is mindless and easy. The hours were fairly flexible and the co-workers usually were just there for a quick buck.
good,"Amazon is the epitome of ""its who you know, not what you know"". HR staff seems too inexperienced to deal with such a vast range of employees for entry level to general management. They were often overwhelmed and ineffective when they were needed."
good,Typical day for me started at 6AM. After clocking in and making it to work area they would start with a short meeting sometimes going over goals they wanted us to reach for the day or just general things if new equipment came in. Before starting work employees would stretch. Then be prepared to work a long shift with a lot of walking. 6AM-530PM was the first shift i believe.
good,"Day and night workers need to take care of their sleeping time because the company have two 10 hours shifts so, it may be difficult for the new workers."
good,"Associates help others while management is busy with production. Advancement is available though you have to fight for what you want. Keep your head to the ground,"
good,Typical day at Amazon is ok. They want high quota for stowers but we stowed big items that took a lot longer than usual. Also if you weren’t a favorite of upper managent you could expect harassment.
good,"The work environment is good. The pay is better than most Warehouse jobs. The Management staff is nice. But they are dead serious about the rate you work at and it just burns you out. The rest of your day is spent resting. You do get a month to get up to speed though, so it's really on you."
good,"have to work 4, 10's. and give up a weekend day (any) sat. or sun. but can work up to two days OT, that's where the earning potential comes in. hard work for older persons like 30+. if you didnt have to hustle so fast to deliver packages it would be a good long term job."
good,dont communicate very well and bad management dont treat their employees well you get the run around when you are trying to get the paperwork in for sick time or personal reason. very stressful place to work. have to worry about keeping rate up over a 100% and its not very easy to do
good,"To me, Amazon is that kind of job that will be there whenever you need it or when you need a job FAST. Ive worked at Ont 2 picking and I've worked at Ont 5 sort center. I definitely like ont 5 better. Shorter shifts, but you can also pick up shifts whenever they send it out which is usually everyday. The PA's definitely have favorites and will labor track them so they don't gotta keep up rate"
good,"You get what you sign up for. It's not a glamorous job, but it's easy and non-stress as long as you keep moving. However, if you find yourself wanting a job that allows you to interact with others, this isn't the place. You can tell people are here for a job that pays well for non-skilled labor. I don't think this is the place to start a career."
good,"Very hard, physical work and poor workplace culture "
good,I would never work in the same environment again. Due managerial aspects that were going on inside of the work place and the constant getting hurt. Also the constant place of management falling through when you need them
good,"Amazon is huge, and the delivery service is fairly new. Taking that into consideration, if you are planning to work there be prepared to unexpected changes in hours. Since they take care of the private contractors better than their own drivers, think twice..Is it better to work with a contractor or directly for Amazon? The job becomes very easy after the month of training, the first month can become a little frustrating, so be prepared, after that becomes easier. Well, Good luck with your Amazon experience.  I was there for 4 months, since they didn't care about their drivers the hours were reduce in such a way that out of 20 that started the same day with me, 4 were still working there when I left, Why? because it was not enough to survive in this crazy economy."
good,It was a Learning experience that I learned alot of skills and stuff to do in a nice period of time. Frankly I would not go back because I feel that I have outgrown it
good,"all jobs are a good experience in life."
good,Revolving door. Management changes hands and expectation on very short notice. 3 strike penalty system. Overall a very intersting learning experience.
good,"Work was mind numbing, fast paced, repetitive, and required very little problem solving skills. It would be exhausting work for most average people. On your feet the entire time, on concrete floors, in a hot sweaty warehouse without enough fans. No A/C but maybe it's better in winter.  Basically unloading trailers, scanning the boxes and envelopes, sorting them into hundreds of bins, putting bins onto racks, staging the racking for the morning people to get them to the delivery vans and the flex drivers. A warehouse called DMC2 in Kansas City near the Arrowhead stadium. All the workers are part-time. If you ever want to go full-time you'll have to transfer to a different facility, but that is not allowed until you've worked 6 months. Health insurance for part-timers technically exists... If I remember correctly it's a $500 allowance that's chopped up into 52 chucks and dolled out to you every week after you've worked 3 months. Work was 11:15pm to 5:45am for 4 days a week, so 24 hours a week.  Extra hours were available sometimes but had to be jumped on quickly, via text or through the amazon a to z app. It pays more ($15.10 per hour plus $0.50 differential) than most warehouse jobs in the area. There's a drug screen and background check."
good,"The pay is a lot less than the kind of work that needs to be done everyday. The min pay should be atleast 20$ an hour. Also there is a lot of bureaucracy going around. If u know someone well, work might be a little easier for u"
good,"For the short amount of time that I was working at Amazon, I saw that the management was doing their best to make a better working environment. It showed that they cared as a company, that the employees actually had a voice. There was some things that I felt were unfair, but they were trying and that is something that I truly admired about Amazon."
good,It's just a part time job to help my income. Nothing exciting about it for me.  Great Benefits and opportunities for advancement. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a second source of income.
good,"You will work hard, you will work long hours. This was never going to be a long-term job for me. I knew the wear and tear on the body it would bring, but for a few months, it was worth it for the money. My first week was fifty hours (it was just before prime week). "
good,It was a lot. And the breaks were not really reasonable. Working a 12 hour shift. Get a 30 minute lunch. Then another 30 but you can’t be late from lunches or anything or you’ll get written up. And walking just to the break rooms were so long. Which only one break room you were allowed to even use your phone
good,"good experience for starters, it is different for anyone. everyday is a different is a new learning. it is a very good place to start a career, overall is good"
good,"be prepared to work long, hard, crazy hours in a loud and unforgiving environment. fast paced, and regimented. all bldgs are different tho. Some have better safety culture than others, some are more inclusive."
good,"Nice workplace..but daily production was sometimes mismanaged.But at the end of the day, I would rate it average. That's all I have to say about that."
good,"At the time of my employment, the dept was new, it was very unorganized. The employees in the dept were constantly getting bounced around from manager to manager. From what I hear now they have worked out the quirks and running way more smoothly."
good,"Operations managers oversee their organization’s production of goods and/or services.  They oversee various departments, such as purchasing, warehousing, and manufacturing.  They must make sure that their company’s products meet or exceed clients’ or customers’ expectation.  They must make sure that their company’s operations run smoothly and effectively.  They oversee budgets.  Depending on the size of their company, they may be involved in establishing sales and profit goals.  They must make sure that their company conducts their business in a safe manner.  They must comply with safety and environmental rules and regulations. "
good,Labor intensive position with little room to learn. 10 hour day shifts while standing in one spot. Its all about shipping out as many packages as possible with no concern for employee needs or safety.
good,Nothing here spectacular or bad. They did have a great cafeteria and the parking was lousy.  Parking got better when they moved from Cupertino to Sunnyvale.
good,"It was a decent part time job while I needed it. Management is terrible at my location. Good temporary job though. The hours were good, the time off system was okay. Main complaint would be the managers, I saw many come and go throughout my year there, most of them were awful, and play the favoritism game."
good,"Amazon sfrutta la gente che ha bisogno ,assumono gente tramite agenzie di lavoro interinale li usano come carne fresca la  masticano bene poi la sputano fuori di  amazon su 1000 operai assunti con contratti part-time ne prendono 10 o 15 persone a tempo indeterminato ."
good,"Würde jederzeit wieder dort arbeiten. Angenehmes Arbeitsklima, Busse von allen größeren HBF"
good,"Buena empresa."
good,"You can be let go at any time for inane reasons...have to suck up to seniority to get ahead, work ethic means nothing. Money is the only sentiment that Amazon understands...never appreciation or promotion. A great job if your soul is already crushed."
good,"It was ok. work was fun. management was ok. hardest part was 12 days, 6 days a week on overtime. it makes you feel like you live there. The benefits were ok."
good,12 hrs constantly standing with only 2 breaks. Overall ok company. Good benefits but too harsh environment. Everyone struggles to complete shift due to so many hrs standing and never getting to sit.
good,"There is no professionalism within the company. Management is more like babysitters who abuse their positions. Favoritism will get you far and when they can't use you anymore they toss you aside no matter what position you hold. Drugs and alcohol used in the parking lot.  Modern day slave labor, Started when the doors opened stayed for two holiday seasons and couldn't take the abuse anymore. Its a jungle. You have j-boggie as a manager and they call this professional.?"
good,Consignes de sécurité bien pris au sérieux! Horaires respectées
good,"Fast-paced, stressful and competitive. Salary and benefits are great. Work culture varies a lot between teams. Good learning and opportunity to explore different roles within the organisation basis one's interest and fitment."
good,This job is very simple and easy to get the hang of but it does get discouraging when you notice the lack of communication between management and employees.
good,"Great place to work, management are idiots. To many graduates with no people skills and if your face fits you’ll do well, very cliquey, it’s who you no in the place if you do well."
good,ti fanno fare un contratto a tre mesi poi ti promettono che andrai avanti ma alla fine non tutti riescono a prorogare i contratti. Valutate bene quello che vi propongono e scegliete un full anche se più corto (15 giorni) almeno non buttate 3 mesi della vostra vita. Il rinnovo diventa una lotteria
good,You never knew when you walked in if you were going to work a full day or be sent home due to lack of orders. You are just a worker bee and a number. It is sad when they tell you to work faster and package quicker but they put you at the end of the packing line and you don't get items to package leaving you to make boxes and stock your area. Just sad.
good,"The managers are cool to work with and most co-workers are nice. Plus you do get decent benefits, but the amount of work they will have you do is not worth the pay."
good,"Everyone I work with is great. The work itself is extremely physically demanding. There is no nearby public transportation to the location I work at so I spend the first two hours of work to pay to be there. Overtime is mandatory and very little advance notice is given. If you're late it's considered an entire hour and you only start out with 10 hr, or one shift, of available time to miss. If you're sick it comes out of those hours until you build up paid time off."
good,"You are on your feet 10 hours a day, you only are only allowed to sit down during lunch break and break which is 30 minutes each. Overtime you would start feeling the affects of standing 40 plus hours a week and will start taking a toll on your body. Management seems to care about your production rate more than anything. I was fortunate to have a great manager but this job is not worth the physical toll and you are not paid enough for it."
good,"The atmosphere is depressing. The money is good, but ultimately not more important than your health. Lots of good benefits. This is a great job for a young person starting out, but the workload is HEAVY and you constantly feel pressured to make quotas which are unrealistic and you WILL get wrote up."
good,Trabajo de alta competitividad con poca proyeccion devido a bajo nivel management.
good,"If you're desperate for work, then I wouldn't blame you for wanting to work for Amazon. Just know that most of the horror stories you hear about working there are true."
good,"This company has taught me valuable lessons, equipping me to be able to adapt to any environment.  The work life balance is said but not actually followed."
good,"ambiente gradevole tra manager e colleghi,turni un po faticosi ma ottimo contratto di lavoro"
good,Could've accepted more packages in to the New Castle Station to keep drivers and other employees employed longer.  But the medical benefits were fantastic for a single man with no children but no dental or vision benefits were made available.
good,Amazon delivery stations are like working in a sweatshop.  The work is nonstop and if you have any sort of disability or chronic illness then you're out of luck.  Despite being one of the fastest stowers during my shifts and skipping breaks to catch up supervisors were always on my back.  After 4 months of deteriorating health and morale I decided to quit.
good,Was hired to a new drivers program for that distribution center. I was excited to get in and climb the ladder in the Logistics division. 3 months into it the program was cut and me an the other drivers were given 3 days notice.
good,"Amazon flex can be fun if you are a goal oriented individual. The routes can be really far and use up so much gas and the app misses streets and makes you take longer routes. If you go to a facility that’s organize, you’ll be able to load up your car within 5-10 minutes. Some places lack organization and will make you wait an hour to load up causing you to lose hours for delivery."
good,"After six years at Amazon it is clear that this company, despite its proclamations, is now fully a Day 2 company. They are innovating in some spaces, but the start-up mentality is no longer here. It feels like they simply throw money and bodies at problems, rather than work to actually find ways to delight the customers."
good,Ambiente di lavoro normale la formazione è buona colleghi normale ops manager buoni manager (capi turno) non sufficentemente preparati poichè neolaureati e incapaci in quanto non aventi esperienza scelta delle persone indeterminato sulla base dei meriti ma non sempre.
good,This job has a lot of potential but the management is sorely lacking. I’m over 40 and there are very few opportunities for advancement. The reason I have stayed here so long is the benefits.
good,Working with robots are fun. Work is challenging but intresting. Meeting target is the challenge everyday and  working hard to acchieve it. Work culture is good .
good,"With Amazon, you need to have a great relationship with your direct manager type have any professional development. You need to be a fast learner and you will meet some amazing associates."
good,ambiente lavorativo dinamico .retribuzione anche se bassa ma precisa al cent.politica lavorativa comprensibile ma non condivisibile ....la forza e illudere le persone anche padri di famiglia spingendo almassimo con la speranza di un contratto a tempo indeterminato ma una volta finite le proroghe ...ciao ciao ....continuo ricambio di personale ...entra fisso uno su mille se capita nel momento giusto o....conosce la persona giusta
good,Working with robots and other types of automation was very interesting.  The treatment of fulfillment center employees especially in the pick area was terrible as quotas are set to unattainable levels.
good,Very high unrealistic quotas to meet and expected to make rate all 10 hours you are there.  They will labor share you all over the building so you have no idea what you will be doing on a day to day basis. Short breaks and lunch room is like a zoo.  Inhale your food and back to work you go.  Excellent health plan if you can adjust to working there.
good,Start out a great place until a new manager got promoted and has killed moral and turning it into a miserable place to work. In the last year we have had our salary capped stocks taken away and our bonus taken away.
good,if you like fast past job with being watch its the job for you.never know what city you are going to be at. only have 30mins to have everything loaded and sometimes they are not even ready for pick up.
good,"Learn a lot new things over there"
good,"It’s a job. It’s hard labor and pay is okay. Work in distribution area where we unloaded truck and sorted out packages into bags to sorting to their delivery van. Music is played. Also, work in the actual putting the item into the package, now that place was awful. Felt like I was in prison, poor air circulation."
good,"I learned that even though they say there is rapid growth and promotion, there is hardly any. Payment is minimum wage and they show you appreciation with random days of free food. This job is great for retired citizens or college students that still live at home, but if you are trying to advance in a career or prove your worth, Amazon Flex may not be the place for you."
good,"It's a very large org and hence u can have plenty of options to choose ur carrier in various different roles with an understanding with your manager,  HR is non functional."
good,"Its an okay job, working conditions are different. long hours, breaks arent actually 30 mins. you can get fired for literally just standing there even when there is no work."
good,Working at Amazon is a place that you gain experience that branches off to job positions outside of that company.  It's a very strenuous and energetic job.  Great job for extra holiday cash.
good,"If you drive for Amazon Flex you will find many benefits, but at times you will question if it is worth it when you interact with the employees at the distribution centers. In fact, they will treat you like you are less than human."
good,"While Amazon is a great place to work where you'll meet great people the management likes to keep the employees in the dark or weren't truthful about daily progress or why they did certain actions. Makes it frustrating when you ask if you can advance to something for months and the only response you ever get is ""I'll get back to you on that later."""
good,you will have no social life working in amazon. however the pay is still worth. although by the end of every shift you feel like a complete zombie. my mental health was not worth it.
good,"Manager faussement sympathique "
good,I was a contractor for 9 months so most of my knowledge is from such a perspective.  Very good at allowing autonomy working remotely.  not too many meetings overall.  Very poor onboarding process.
good,"Trés bon environnement de travail."
good,"- Fast pace and stressful work environment"
good,"Hope that you get placed on a good team. The process is basically completely random. I worked on a team that did not match my background, and they had also never worked with an intern before. At the end of the internship, I was left with little feedback and not much growth."
good,"Problem solving,shipping&recieving,inventory rf scanner,picking,electric pallet jack loafing&unloading incoming or outgoing trailers,managing a group of 8, safety fast paste environment"
good,The pay was decent but there was little organization as a whole and there were no guaranteed hours. A lot of days I would go in and they would immediately ask who would want to go home because they did not have enough work for us to do. I usually was done with my route before the 8 hours was up and my choices were to go home early or hang out at the station until my time was up. They also determine the hours you work despite the fact that they ask you what your preference would be during the interview process.
good,"You have to be a strong individual to do this job, alot of walking,  running, no break  other than that you work alone , team work when needed  help, pay is great"
good,"Worked 12 hours shifts. had 4 days on and 3 off.  I  arrived at work, we through security and had to put my things in the locker.  They started with a meeting to let us know what we will be doing for that day. We went to our stations and did our job. The thing I dislike the most was our lunch started and we had to walk far to the break room and that took up most of our time."
good,Most customer centric organisation. Chance to work with very smart and competitive peers and an immense learning with exposure to the entire business.
good,okay very fast paced some favoritism among workers not very good supervision enjoyed packing the art of filling boxes correctly and working with other emplyees
good,It was good because its a fast paced working environment which I love but at the end of the shift tiring because the whole shift you are standing.The co-employees are mostly not helpful and not friendly in my shift. The managers are helpful.
good,The insurance was decent and it’s cool that they give you your vacation time so quickly it was just the most boring job I’ve ever had. It wasn’t worth driving all the way there from where I lived at the time.
good,"I worked at Amazon for more than five years as a seller and had a 99 rating. After one negative review, I lost my account every appeal. I was effectively banned from selling because someone didn't like a $3 book she bought and Amazon didn't bother to make an actual person available. It was awful."
good,Me parese que paraser una empresa mundial que se necesite  peloteo debería ser supervisada y ser juzgados los empleados de acuerdo a su trabajo no por la relación de amistad  o peloteo con su jefe
good,"Too much inconsistency in what different managers. Did not receive the sign on bonus I was offered. Talked to management to claim it and they told me it was not in our area, showed them the email I received and they said I'd get my bonus in about a week and after that week my bonus was still missing and they began to avoid me."
good,"$15/Hour to scan boxes for around 4 hours if working one shift, 8 hours if working two. About 15-20 hours a week. Management strict, unpaid breaks, electronic system tracks you if you're late returning from break."
good,The young supervisors and leads are over kill with beaming cheerleader antics. But they were professionals and pulled productivity out of the chaos. The pace productivity expected hours on your feet. Breaks are non-existent. The from scan to scan rule steals any joy you might achieve on break. Seriously. Like 5 min by the time you walk the entire place to get outside. But seasonal position I made killer money. It was worth it
good,"Every day has its own unique challenges. If you thrive in ambiguous situations, you will like this position. Working to make the whole better is what we thrive for."
good,Can't get enough hours. Too many people working. They don't care about their employees. It is too good to be true. Maybe you can make an extra  100 bucks.
good,"N/A- My position as a fulfillment associate is to work in a warehouse environment selecting, packing and shipping customer"
good,The overall job experience was great it’s just really boring there was no action and it was hard to get schedule in cause they had so many workers I was looking for full time all they could offer was part time management sucked they didn’t know how to do there job
good,"You have to pretty much be a robot there.. Everyone is unhappy. WORK environment is a travesty . Barley have time to urinate or you'll get TOT, too "
good,"A generic call centre atmosphere, boosted by frequent morale building themed days. Management were professional. The experience was damaged because it was a contracted job, and the contracting company were very unprofessional."
good,In my time there most of management had no knowledge of how to run a department and relied on their PA's and in turn they relied on working the associates into the ground. Always made a fuss about making rate and how you should improve(they didn't pay more for higher packing/picking rates)
good,Good experience overall. Experience varies according to team and manager. Expectations may not always be clear or measurable.Good benefits and employee perks like concerts and events.
good,The management here was  corrupted. They did not care about employees health or well being. I had sprained my back and they still tried to make work. I went on an LOA when it was suppose to be workers comp. They stated that they gave me the wrong paper work. I asked for the right paperwork and HR ignored me so I called the main office and they paid me for all the days I had off when I was suppose to be working.
good,"This is a fast passed environment, your pulling pallets and driving forklifts. Taking case of products off a conveyer line and put them on a pallet to be taken to the dock for loading trailers"
good,Amazon company is way to huge to not pay their employees enough. They want us to do hard labor and manage our personal lives but dont pay us enough to even manage our lives. They are favoritism in amazon and I think everyone should be treated equally. They have us like we in the army in this place. Everything is time time time. We get write ups for just time. Not a place for me.
good,"Poorly managed company."
good,"Average job, decent environment. Pay is next to nothing compared to the excess of work. Plus no benefits for seasonal associates. Discouraging to take days off, attendance points are dystopian."
good,"The work itself isn't too bad but shifts vary between 3-5 hours, so you could work anywhere between 15-30 hours per week depending on how many shifts you have. $15/hour isn't enough to live on since the job is part time. Managers are easy to get along with if you do your job"
good,Not the kind of job I would recommend to anyone only if your really desperate . The hours were really long and you only get 1 break throughout the 10 hour shift your on and you can’t quit midway since the bus only comes at certain times
good,"Mind numbing job, which personally I could only handle for three months, however there are people who have been there for years, so it all depends on your personality."
good,Big brand and great learning in your role. One has a chance to move across different teams and learn new skills based on the interest. However overall workplace has lot of stress.
good,"Area Managers are underpaid for the expected work flow.  Good job for  college hire to boost resume.  Internal promotions only warrant a 10% raise, while external hire peers at the same level earn 30-40% higher."
good,I feel when you work 12 and a half hours ..you should get more than an hour and a half of breaks..that's 11 hours on your feet ..puts a toll on your feet and on oneself ..wasn't just me..my co workers feel the same
good,"Busy work day from beginning to end, management don't care to much about employees. Just cared only about moving products, good for benefits since benefits start the same day you begin your employment. And plenty of room to advance but, long and tiring work days."
good,"The environment is very competitive between employees, making chances for advancement extremely difficult. nobody follows up with rules leaving a lot of gray areas for you to be written up, and eventually fired."
good,Great place to work for about the first month until your managers expect you to do everything so they can not even show up to there job.  They constantly move managers around so others can't get trained or moved up.
good,"This was a really good job but there was a lot of packing and lifting (sometimes heavy goods only) which wasn’t always healthy. Pay was considerably good. "
good,"Job was very frustrating good pay bad hours , I’m only doing this review because indeed won’t leave me alone . But if you do get hired here I would say it’s best to focus on getting a paycheck"
good,Reward those who do a good job.  Do not pay everyone $15/hour.  My manager is a good manager.  Her manager was very poor and lies out of his teeth.  He knows nothing about hard work.
good,"high production rate. high stress. good benefits. you get vacation time, paid time off and unpaid time off. 4 day work week. to much voluntary  time off."
good,"Aucune indemnité de frais kilométrique, cadence très soutenue et pression morale"
good,There is no job security and no one can never apply again for job ..if you say truth to customer  it means you will no longer part of company.if you are able to move bull around field then you will be successfull
good,"If you want to work for Amazon you already know you're going to be selling your soul. Don't do it if you have any personal integrity and don't mind stepping on the backs of honest, hard working people and manipulating others to get ahead."
good,"nice company to work for but compensation/benefits don't match expectations of performance; management not consistent with methods of operation, too much penalization for missed time"
good,The benefits are nice but you don't have a life outside of work.  I was not allowed to change my schedule after almost a year of work.  My shift was  6:00pm to 4:30 am.
good,"This was a okay place to work if you need something quick and something that will pay you fairly. This isn't a place where you will get too many hours, no more than 30 per week. Good part time job."
good,Too many change overs when it comes to managers. If their was a complaint about a manager you really had no one to talk to about the  issue. At the time I worked it was 85% production rate which was customers giving you a yes as to handle their problem which in my opinion was not fair because so people did not answer the questions that was sent to them after the call and some that did gave you a No for no just reason. Customers calling about a price change and knowing that you could not would give you a No which would be a negative impact on your rate which went against you having a job
good,If you don't mind warehouse work this job is for you. Standing for long periods of time and lots of walking. On the plus side it helped me lose weight.
good,The job was alright but it was really unorganized . They wasn't prepared as well the products was all over the place .the dispatch didn't even keep up with the routes it was all over the place
good,"Working as a case receiver in the warehouse was a lot of hard work. Heavy lifting, dragging, counting, unpacking, and repackaging are all a part of the job as well as making rate. However, being a hard worker can pay off, if you get noticed there is an opportunity to move to other areas of the warehouse and develop skills in different areas."
good,"Amazon is not for everyone, very cutthroat environment. You can make decent money there however you will feel like you sold your soul to get it. Lots of smart folks, those who are just starting their career are likely to leave after a short stay Those seasoned folks will likely stay for a few years but be faced with is the money enough to keep making home life sacrifices?"
good,"Worked the night shift Problem Solve at a small location in San Antonio, it was tough. Imagine going on a 5 mile hike on concrete with a plastic back full of other people's breath, sweat, and smells over your head (with no AC). It's basically like that + you're constantly crossing your fingers praying that there's water in the water dispensaries that you work near. Not to mention you're constantly looking over your shoulder trying to look as busy as possible if/when a manager walks buy so they don't pull you from your work to help with something else (and in Problem Solve here you have to CONSTANTLY be on top of things or else it can slip up everyone else)."
good,There is a lot of stress working for Amazon and sometimes the Management doesn't help you to release this stress. The work/life balance is quietly awful.
good,"So when I first worked at Amazon it said I could work part time but this guy said this is only a full time job, then I was saying that I had to go to college and I have not had everything situated in college so I don't know my hours yet so can I do part time and he said talk to H&R on your first day and I did and they said they work with it and then gave me a selection of hours that still didn't work, that was the week I found out my hours for college, but if you want to work there full time it's probably like 11hours, and good pay. Oh and it's a lot of lifting and you get hit with box's a lot and your fingers get hurt too, even if your wearing your gloves, I picked up a big metal that I had to find the sticker on cause they did it wrong and put the sticker at the bottom of metal and they're supposed to put it out where we can see it and my fingers got smoosh and my nail was bleeding."
good,You are just a number at this company not a human being. Could not recommend to family or friends not ones you care about anyway. I have never worked so hard at a job and my whole life.
good,Very favoritist and biased in regards to advancement opportunity and job development. If you're looking for great career opportunity just keep in mind that you won't fit the bill if you're a minority with exponential experience rather they prefer others with a certain physical appeal or a heightened background in social and economical status. Don't be fooled. Use it for whatever it's worth only.
good,"The work isn't difficult, but a few managers provide a source of stress by micromanaging. "
good,"Be prepared to work at least 12 hours, (more during peak and prime week); you need to work in an independent project to improve the processes on top of a really hectic shift requirement. The PA development also reflects you, and some people just don’t care. High turnover rates among associates so having someone to train properly will be key."
good,"Monotonous production based atmosphere.  Seemed as if management was more worried about productivity than the actual employee. I am used to an environment who focuses on the well being of the employee and works on their development, so this was a change."
good,"managers never know whats going on, everything is constantly changing, productivity goals are unrealistic, hours arent to terrible until the holiday season comes around"
good,"They have several schedules to pick from.  Can get very repetitive.  Very hard on body, standing all day.  Can get hot.  Have mandatory over time that can be 10 or 12 hours depending on what they need.  Management doesn't always communicate very well.  Get vacation, personal time off and unpaid time off.  Have an online employee site where you can request time off and see schedule."
good,Keep changing managers and have issues with the way the work is setup and no problems resolvers shortage of people who at least resolve the issue.  Explain what steps to improve get it working and then a new supervisor with new set of rules.  Favoritesm in the company within the managers and employees.
good,"They pay ambassadors the same as temps but expect management work ethic. Reports, coaching, assignments etc. You run the shift while the management sits in the AC offices. You are not paid for doing this job but required to do it. And for the most ridiculous aspect, no AC on the floor. Almost 100 degrees year round in Florida and many times vending machines are empty/broken."
good,I don't have enough space to talk about that place. The communication is awful... you have 150 managers and they all tell you different things to do.. no one is on the same page... you double work... I DIDN'T WANNA LEAVE A REVIEW BUT IT FORCED ME
good,Job very stressful. People are promoted because they are quick packers and not because the know how to manage people. High turnover. Lunch breaks are short.
good,They hire to many seasonal employees. Filled out for conversion to full time. I worked hard but no way of being hired full time. Supervisors did not know what needed to be done.
good,"The experience at the Amazon facility was based upon that it was a unique opportunity into how the Amazon process proceeded. Each area worked in its own way to fulfill the process of getting items moved, packaged, and shipped. If not for the long hours and odd shift, I might have enjoyed it more."
good,Heavy boxes. Not for women. fast pace. Your scanning and lifting boxes then sorting in bins by area code. Or you can sort from the converter belt. Or you sorting from the frieght truck. All of it is lifting. Good job for a strong built man.
good,"Worked in a Fulfillment Center as an Operations manager.  Job was mentally challenging and extremely fast paced.  Expectations are high, and poor performance is not tolerated.  Type-A personalities do well, as well as those willing to make others look less competent to benefit themselves.  Overall great learning experience and I am continuing to use some of the things I learned at Amazon in my daily work life."
good,a great company to work for! the driving position is very strenuous. its a lot of getting in and out the car with packages some being extremely heavy. This position is seasonal with NO benefits.
good,"Micromanagement"
good,"You will hurt every day you are working here. 10 hour work days. Sometimes 11-12 hour shifts occasionally when on mandatory.  Mandatory overtime is awful and can consist of 55-60 hour work weeks for weeks at a time. November-December are 55-60 hour work weeks. Don’t expect any holidays off from work except Christmas Day.  You do get 8 hours of paid vacation for 4th of July, but if it’s not your day off you work all day."
good,"Be prepaired to work with idiots. The type that place boxes, clearly labled,""heavy,"" at the top of 6ft pallets. They fall off. They hurt. "
good,I was a seasonal employee. I worked in shipping loading trucks. I also packaged and labeled outbound freight. Other duties included restocking boxes used for shipping. Cleaning assigned work areas. A typical day at work was not a stable day. You may start out in one department and end up in a different department. The workplace culture was diverse. There a variety of personalities to work with.
good,Enjoyed the job. Easy work. No brainer job. Can be physical at times. Paid well. Benefits were good. The 10% discount could've been better; only amounted to $100 a year. Can't advance unless you are good looking or kiss a lot of butt.
good,"The job isn’t hard to understand and do but the work demanded is too much. The warehouse where I worked, there was no a/c or fans in each station unless you are lucky to find one working or that no one has taken yours from the your work station. You have to be careful on how many bathroom breaks you take and how long you take to get back to work because it will cost you. The pay is great but the hours put into it is ridiculous. I was full time, working 10 hour shifts for 4 days overnight, the breaks were two 15 mins and lunch/dinner was 30 mins. I understand a job is a job but I’m not sure if this type of work environment is for everyone. It didn’t work for me, I made it a year there and was completely drained physically and emotionally."
good,"Coworkers often complained and slacked off. Most of the management was pretty good from what I encountered. The most frustrating part about working here was that the coworkers wouldn't do their job properly so, everyone would get in trouble and their job would have to be redone by someone else."
good,"If you keep your head down, work hard, and stay on task, its an easy enough job. The shifts are long and the adjustment can be difficult, but the compensation and benefits are worth it."
good,"Basic repetitve work, kinda depressing over time, if your in school its perfect for you. If your not going to school and just want some easy bread this is the place for you."
good,Prefer to have college education with little to no experience in the actual work force in management positions. Unfortunate for those with skills and talent other than assigned job task.
good,"I did not enjoy working at Amazon. Management could’ve been better. Employees did not seem friendly. The atmosphere was sort of competitive, but did not make sense seeing that everyone is doing basically the same thing."
good,i worked hard and l did my best. The company need to pay money for the long work hours they make the associates perform. Amazon rate need to go up. Life is good.
good,Not a bad place to work for a second job in the side. Many workers are lazy and management doesn't help. If youre good at the job they expect that everyday all day no matter what. Cliques galore and every shift blamed the other.
good,"Good for benefits and salary at the management level but very poor  work life balance. Metrics driven, scheming management with a toxic culture created by a cabal of people mainly from the armed forces."
good,"Worked at DLA5 as it’s as starting out. There was a lot to figure out and our work crew were the test subjects. The team was run by a manager who was just a kid. We’d arrive as scheduled and sometimes there would be no work as the trucks were late or we’d have to leave our shift early because there wasn’t that many incoming packages. There was a lot of favoritism and those favorites would get the less mind numbing jobs and were taught more valuable things that could help them advance their career. A lot of horseplay and drama between coworkers. The management team tried their best to creat a fun work culture. However, breaks are 15 minutes on the dot and start as you start to walk to the break room. That really sucked for some at the other end of the facility, as it was a 3-4 minute walk to the break room or bathroom. Pay was okay for what you do. Definitely not a living wage but better than most places offer for a “warehouse” job."
good,"this isnt an enjoyable job, its a grind that slowly wears you down throughout your time there. expected to hit high targets and told off when you dont yet are giving as much as you can to get there."
good,"Lavoro individuale, organizzato e controllato , contraddittorio su alcuni aspetti su cui fondano il marchio."
good,It's just a job with a limited chance of advancement. The pay is fair for they ask of their employees but the rules are set. They are not flexible at all.
good,"Managers were too young and thought they knew it all. Acted like they listened but turned around and would do the exact opposite of what was promised to me face to face. I was hired to manage a few specific things and another manager thought he could tell me that’s not what I was hired for, creating a confusing and frustrating work place. When I’d confront my manager about this he would take the other managers side. Toxic and manipulative. When I did confront my manager about a couple things that were happening he literally said I was acting like a victim. Yeah, so there’s that. He acted like I could go to him with things... Who wants to open up to a manager who tells his subordinate that? No thanks!"
good,The expectations you are required to meet are far more than a standard workday. Forced to work nights and weekends often. Work-life balance is the biggest downfall.
good,"Amazon is not for everyone.  You will be paid a lot but a lot will be expected of you.  The ability to accept real time feedback and adjust accordingly is essential."
good,"when people would work and talk at the same time, they would get in trouble while management's favorites would stand around and talk to one another as well to process assistant or ambassador"
good,I like working at Amazon it was the hrs. I didn't have enough time to spend with my grandchildren. In the morning i would judt have enough time to say have a great day in school and when i got off it was time to eat dinner and then the kids had to go to bed.
good,"nada que destacar, trabajo en contact center atendiendo llamadas, lo mejor los compañeros y el horario de mañana con pocos fines de semana"
good,"With everything you do there is a rate you must reach. Yes they gave a nice raise, I was almost to $14 and now, even the day 1 people make the same. There will be another raise in 3 years."
good,"Fast Paced, lots going on, plenty of change, progression if you have a degree, working with exceptionally talented people, pay and benefits are good, a very diverse workforce, and you will gain huge amounts of experience."
good,it’s an okay place. But if you are not promoted within first 2 years you will stay at the bottom until you quit or get fired. But it’s a good job to support a small family
good,Opportunities are available if you are willing to forego your home/work balance and not think for yourself. Management is usually recruited right out of college with no real life experiences and look for ways to pass the blame vs own up to their own short comings. Management is known to just give lip service vs trying to find out what the real problems are.
good,"Only way to advance in this company is to kiss the manager's butt, which I wasn't going to do even if you worked hard. Hard to advance in this company if not in a more important role."
good,"-typical work day was hot and crowded with stress"
good,"The work at the distribution center is rarely challenging, but it keeps you busy.  There is always more work to do and its nearly always fast paced.  I enjoy the speed of the work, but I don't feel Amazon's interview process is designed to place employees where the would best benefit the company.  I am thankful for the quick employment, but my skill-set is largely untapped."
good,"Driving for Amazon is cool except leaving and helping others.  For example, if your shift ends at 7, even if you do all your work by 5:30, they find work for you that goes past 7."
good,"Amazon is a huge company with competitive pay and great benefits but they find each associate replaceable within seconds there is no second chances, no minor offenses first strike and you’re gone, you can’t bring your phone into work and you have to go through airport like security in order to leave the building, the work environment is very loud I didn’t mind working here, however, I wouldn’t make a career out of Amazon unless you plan on getting a bachelors in business and moving up in the company."
good,Good security at Amazon is dependable upon productivity and attendance.  The management at Amazon is mediocre. They care for themselves. Training is done by same level associates as an entry level associate. Job work/ Life balance is difficult with the ten hour shifts.
good,Often sent to places that require a 4 wheel drive and eventually broke the front axle of my Acura.  Not real happy about that.  Aside from destroying my vehicle I do enjoy driving and delivering. It would be nice to have a company vehicle.
good,Simple jobs but hard to progress or get noticed for potential improvement. Steady job and easy to get to as i live in Rugeley. Wanted more of a challenge.
good,A fast pace job that treats you like your just a number and not a person. The job pays it's employees weekly. They have three shifts you can work.Its a job that will give you a lot of hours.
good,"Working from home, in your pajamas if you want, sounds great... unless you actually care about the work you do and want to help your customers. If you care about doing a good job, you'll quickly find that your supervisors have no idea what they're doing and all of your reference materials that you rely on to do your job are being re-written on the fly, sometimes while you are accessing them. There is little to no guidance working from home, so you're on your own to do the best you can. I found the lack of structure and organization very unprofessional and stressful. If you just want to do the bare minimum and get a check you'll probably be just fine."
good,"being an Amazon employee teach you how big companies work what tools it uses what big vision is, but on the other side at Amazon you would be lucky if you get under good manager who could treat you good and promote you if you deserve, but in general working to Amazon will teach you a lot of things that you would never learn it in smaller companies."
good,Amazon is a fast paced work environment where you are always stretched beyond your role and responsibilities. The find those who are willing to sacrifice the most and work on promoting them. You do not get to hire you're own team or pick who you work with or promote.
good,"Amazon is not a place for everyone to work. You have to be a very hard working, have lots of time, and willing to stand for 10 plus hours a day. You have to have the mindset."
good,"The management process is abusive, and I'm currently a manager. I've seen too much ""behind the wall"" and hate how our individual performers can be treated. You are forced to ride people and stack rank employees...I've been forced to give good employees bad overall ratings because of politics and stack ranking."
good,"Au sein j'ai pu m'exercer a travailler a un certain rythme , ainsi qu'un autonomie."
good,You are just a number and are replaceable. It sometime feels like there is favoritism by your leads and managers. The more you do the more they expect and never make you feel they are thankful.
good,"Must be able to stand on your feet for ten hours.  Overtime is periodically and a must at times, sometimes only notified within eight hour time period."
good,Amazon used to have a fun atmosphere but now it’s just another mundane place to work. Amazon is a good place to work if you’re just looking for a stepping stone and not a resting place. The benefits are amazing. The pay isn’t as good as it sounds and almost everything you read in the papers is true.
good,"This company operated at a very fast pace, basically every job you do for them will be rated and you must maintain a minimum rate of 100% or you can be terminated. the shifts are long and can be very boring. and it is very hard work. "
good,"Good to work and learn with other Software Developers , challenging problems to solve, the scale is tremendous and compensation is at par with industry."
good,Poor Management  was not very helpful when not meeting the needs and listening to or fixing problems. Work environment was poor could not leave station to use restrooms.
good,it was okay! i felt the workers were more of a help than the actual staff (team leaders) was a lot of friendly people who worked here but overall some days things would be poorly set out!
good,"Amazon is a very competitive work place, everyone is replaceable in the managerial eyes. Employees aren't treated fairly and are easily taken advantage of."
good,Amazon is a great place to start out at but it’s likely that you will never get past bottom level. It’s just as unfortunate that management is as new as the fresh starts.
good,"Fair pay and benefits for hard work, but not for the faint of heart or body. Advancement based on work experience alone is unlikely. Very casual and sometimes hostile environment."
good,"The pay is decent but the hours are not guaranteed. For instance, if the volume of packages coming in is low, you'll only end up working two or three hours but if the volume is high, your shift may range from 4 to 5 hours. It varies. One of the main things I dont like about working there is that you're treated like a robot instead of a person. There are a few good managers but most of them treat the employees like they don't matter. HR sucks as well."
good,Productive.  They only offered part time work when I worked there and not enough pay or benefits.  However it was a nice place to work.  The people were nice and helpful including mgmt.
good,"Pros:"
good,Seemed to be a pretty rigorous job culture. My manager seemed to be resentful of me as the performance of the team increased under my supervision instead of his...
good,"The company has a less accepting Leadership. Amazon over the years have deteriorated in the quality of it's people and hence the company in itself. It pays well to outsiders but doesn't deploy the concept of market correction for it's in house talent."
good,"The first start up for Amazon Prime in Atlanta, hired as a Dispatch Supervisor for Prime, than was thrown in to Logistics without any training tools for the warehouse , The manager was not very nice did not have any training tools for logistics."
good,"Amazon is a leading e-commerce company."
good,"fast paced environment working 10 hour days 4 days per week, extended to 6 days per week mandatory during peak season. "
good,"Extremely fast paced sink or swim environment. Not a good place for work-life balance, but definitely a career booster. Its like getting a masters degree in fulfillment and operations."
good,If you have family this not the job for you.  The job comes first and you will feel like your family is not important.  You will miss many things in your family's life.
good,"The company has potential to grow the management in different areas need help most managers are not qualified to do there jobs the hours are long and being crossed trained in different areas would help the day go by faster is you could change you station . "
good,"Stressful if you're not used to it. Fun at the beginning. after that, its pretty much repetitive work for 10 hours, 4 days a week. Rate is everything. You must meet their rate/quota of the day, everyday. "
good,Enjoyed working at Amazon.  Was looking forward to becoming a permanent employee as well as upcoming promotional training. I would consider future employment in a higher-end job.
good,"This is a small operation in a small leased space located behind other businesses. You are either stowing packages or doing small sort during night shifts. There isn't a lot of room for advancement, all of the ambassador positions are filled and there isn't a need for rotation in loading/unloading the trucks. "
good,Was hired as seasonal/temp in early October..Have been told since late Jan. we would be converted to a permanent position with bennefits. Now late March still no bennefits. Very fast paced job. Nice co workers.
good,"For people that will not buy into the work culture it might be hard to assimilate. My department specifically introduced statuses we had to log on, where we basically were controlled every minute of the day to see what were were up to. When trying to contest the introduction of such system, we were met with dissent."
good,You must be fast...quick.  Nothing is slow at Amazon.  You either get it or your gone.  No sympathy.  Your entire performance level is based on your ability to be fast and accurate.
good,"Work environment was good. Too much walking. "
good,possibilité de travailllé en toute autonomie une fois que la confiance est présente.
good,Being in diverse businesses Amazon is a place to learn through curiosity. Extremely fast paced dynamic work environment which constantly challenges you.
good,"Due to all the changes from management, the Amazon environment has become more volatile and not as easy to get used to."
good,"- Coworkers and Mangement are friendly (most of the time)."
good,"Ugh. .  Management is lacking, coworkers couldn't care less, and that to the Whole Foods atmosphere of customers..."
good,"Amazon operates in a very machine like fashion. essentially your a cog in their bigger picture and they are allowed no sympathy for any kind of misgiving that may happen. It was one of my first jobs so I can't say with certainty if my opinion is biased or not but from how i remember it, I wouldn't go back to work there."
good,"A typical day is 10 hours with two paid 15-minute breaks and one unpaid 30-minute lunch, so 10.5 hours from start to end of shift. The insurance is great, but unless you can keep up with the constantly increasing rate/workflow expectations, you may find yourself out of a job. Managers are shifted at least yearly, if not semi-annually, so you may have 1-3 managers in one year without changing your shift or department. The hardest part of the job is maintaining rate consistently throughout the day, even with system problems. Sitting is not allowed during work time unless you have one of the specific jobs that allows it; if you are found to be sitting, you will be asked about it. The breaks and lunch divide the day into four quarters, which can make the day more manageable. There are multiple break rooms with vending machines throughout the building, but not many restrooms for the size of the building. During times of high order traffic, you may be expected to work 60 hour weeks, sometimes for weeks in a row, but will be scheduled a minimum of 40 hours per week as a full-time employee. Overtime is paid at a rate of 1.5x your normal rate. They do offer Voluntary Time Off when they have too many people for the workload, which does not count against your personal time, but is still unpaid. It is unlikely that you will see your manager more than once per day, and that would only be if they happen to be there that day and not in meetings."
good,zombie life style but good money. everyone was walking around tired and exhausted due to long hours and short breaks. targets were always increasing and people been paid off quite a lot
good,"Enjoyed working as ICQA Specialist and PIT operator. "
good,"Very talented and highly educated people.  Long hours and a super competitive environment.  Leadership at Amazon means pushing your team hard. You will learn a lot of skills, be entrusted to make decisions and encouraged to take risks.  Compensation packages are generous.  But you are a means to an end, a replaceable part.  If you are looking for appreciation or loyalty this is not the place for you."
good,I'll say the hardest part of working there. Would having to balance is your walk speed going to and from east/west wing. Also going up & down four floors of stairs under five minutes.
good,What can I say they paid my bills.to much Where in tear It was a very hostile environment too many people complain.for the most part people could leave at any time we had personal time and vacation time that we could use any day if we had any Emergency
good,no support in hours. no guarantee of hours. no Opportunity for advancement for hard working people. If u have connections u will get promoted otherwise forget it!
good,"I worked at Amazon for over 5 years. When it was smaller, I was empowered to achieve a lot and teams were more supportive. As the org grows, however, teams across have become much more political and bureaucratic. There are resource fighting internally and people can be cutthroat to try to get ahead. "
good,Casual dress code. Most people are nice. Some groups of people do not do as much work as they should. This can create stress with other workers. There are groups of people that work hard and there are groups of people that get out of work all they can. Some of the people that get out of work have been there longer.
good,I was working for them for 3 1/2 years and I quit due to not being able to advance with the company at all.  I was trained for every position I held and I can not complain. I simply did not like the fact that when it came to the training department they would not show any one the few steps in Microsoft Excel that they used at the time.
good,Peak is too stressful. Working 50-60 hours a week on christmas vacation is ridiculous and strenuous. The Pay and benefits are amazing though. But I’m not about to kill myself over a job working too much. Also PTO and UPT are unethical. There needs to be more. Second and third Manager were the best.
good,"You will learn a lot at Amazon but the culture is also harming people.  Amazon, as any big coporation penertrated a culture that you need to know how to navigate within the giant machine, unfortunately this is getting worse, what you can do don't matter as much as knowing your way around."
good,"Would recommend as a part time job during holidays for extra cash, other than that, don’t waste your time unless you’re a college student trying to get a more technical job with a growing company like this."
good,"amazon as a company is a great company that gives many opportunities for the employees, for example, the career choice program apprenticeship programs but the management inside the warehouse don't care about employees too much they only care about the business goals"
good,"Die Arbeit an sich ist nicht schwer, man wird auch gut eingearbeitet, doch danach steht man mehr oder weniger alleine da. Das Arbeitsklima wirkt kalt und stur, ein Gemeinaschaftsgefühl entsteht nicht. Die Bezahlung/das Gehalt ist für die erbrachte Leistung gut."
good,"Fueled by loads of coffee and a continuous stream of telephonic chatter, I would deal with online queries and complaints / compliments. The environment was very easy-going and relaxed but below the easy atmosphere was a firm and controlled dedication to duty, carefully monitored by our supervisors and managers."
good,"Rewarding but no Life Work Balance"
good,"It is hard on the body to stand in the same place for 10 hours or more a day. You have to keep moving the rest of your body constantly though. 30 minutes lunch break is not enough. "
good,"Pros: Benefits are great. There is a snack store in the break room. Opportunity to travel to other states or countries to train others. Opportunity to learn development skills. Career program."
good,It was fun at first then it started changing and u have to let your vacation and other time off options build before you can use it. Some managers are rude and you can’t make a decision to quit something that u don’t want to do anymore that is considered as indirect work that’s not what you got hired for. Really easy to get written up. No music or headphones. A lot of voluntary time off and mandatory overtime days up to 60 hours a week.
good,"Delivering Amazon Prime packages from own vehicle. The past year has seen a serious decline in flexibility. Routes are given out instead of selected, and all routes are now at least 20 miles from the warehouse."
good,These past couple of weeks have been quite informative that there is a fatal disconnect in communication from the higher ups. Shifts and hours that they had for the workers are being switched around and taken with little information as to why or what to do. HR gives promises and solutions that aren't followed through and the managers don't try to assist their workers in fixing things. A cycle of disappointment for those thinking they could have a good job there.
good,Typical day at work varied from place to place wherever you worked in the warehouse. Shifts are 10 hours long with two 30 minute breaks (of which only one is paid). Work can become very repetitive therefore it is always advised to try and move around to other type of work within the warehouse. Applying through agency will give you very limited job security.
good,"make sure all the customer orders are fulfill and resolve any issue within the processes."
good,"you get a half hour for lunch, two fifteen minute breaks. overtime was mandatory, they provided free earplugs in the areas were earplugs were required."
good,the amazon culture is wonderful along with the perks.. the only thing is in my opinion you are nothing but a number to amazon. Day started with exercise and a brain wash session. then it went on to a fast paced walk around the very very large warehouse collecting items for two and half hours then a 15 min break that was really seven minutes with the time it takes to get to your break destinations. then it went back a fast paced walk gathering items for a hour and forty-five min. then lunch time. then we did that again for another five hours
good,"I was a ""picker"". You clock in. You scan your ID badge with a hand held scanner. You then proceed to where your scanner tells you. Pick the item(s), put it in your yellow tote and proceed to the next location. You received two 15 minute (paid) breaks. And one 30 minute lunch break (unpaid)."
good,"I worked for Amazon for 3 1/2 years, with highly different experiences any time a new manager was hired in either due to someone moving on or if someone grew. Almost all new managers were never good at their jobs or listened to their experienced employees because Amazon doesn't do strong enough career background checks and personality tests to keep the weakest wannabee despots out of the building. Punishing higher level managers is near impossible with the structure and the company does not work with employees to improve their standards. Most managers do not walk out of the office to communicate with their team or to build morale/develop. If one does work on the former things, there is very little incentive and overall the culture is too difficult to improve without another manager face lift. Development is fickle if the managers do not personally like you and qualifications mean very little. Higher level managers admit fully that politics is the name of the game and they have no interest in critiquing it or improving the culture."
good,Stressful place to work. You have to maintain quota which is hard to reach or you will be replaced.  You must be available to work overtime with little notice.
good,"Travail pas très intellectuel mais plutôt répétitif, manuel voire physique selon certains postes. Entreprise très désorganisée dans l'ensemble. "
good,Worked there almost 3 years management was terrible. Wouldn't go back. Pay was average at the time but not enough to live off of without a second income
good,"I enjoyed the time I work there but management is very poor and it seems that you have high clique vibe and Im too grown for that, if you kiss up to the managers your fine but your work and performance is not even notice."
good,Très agréable passée un bonne période la préparation commande ma plu énormément.
good,Your home and work life balance is not balanced at all. Promotions are a gesture of favoritism. Lay-offs are minimum but during the holiday seasons is when you work the most.
good,"Good company to work and learn from, everything is done differently to every other company I have worked for previously.  Some of this ideas work and others not so well"
good,Typically most workers at Amazon scan packages to be sent to the post office after the packages come down a conveyor so that customers may receive them. A large majority of the day is figuring out how to place boxes together neatly and safely so that the post office has little trouble in sending them out.
good,The hours available for shifts at my location were basically night shift only or low hour day shifts. The night shift was interfering too much with my other job and personal life. If you are looking for 24 hours a week graveyard shift this job is a good fit as long as you are willing to deal with a few obnoxious coworkers.
good,Can manage better such as full break time instead of 20 minutes of a 30 minute break rates could be better to achieve as many people cant work faster than others however their should be free travel instead of paying 2  pound to work and 2 pound back to area which is ridiculous.
good,"Working for Amazon is a great experience. My management and co-workers were great. Friendly and agreeable. Management definitely listens if you have concerns. "
good,It was not easy work and some times management cares more about productivity than safety. Great benefits and decent pay though. The entire management team was straight out of college which could become difficult to deal with.
good,Its was greater working there in the beginning when I first started in Moreno Valley CA at Ont 6. Which is a sortable facility. Meaning there are more departments and opportunities to move around and advance within the company. It's also more people with a higher exciting morale making it a fun and enjoyable work environment.
good,Employees asked to keep a high productivity pace and efficiency when task training is poor and they do not allow employee to get a full understanding of the task before moving them on and then giving the employee negative marks for poor efficiency.
good,ok work place for a step and stone most management is young and they don't know how tot alk to adults. they pressure you in to wrking really fast then when they are slow they don't want you to work as fast. Give out a lot of vto when there is no work.
good,"the work is really fast paced, some of the managers are really great. i would have stayed longer, but the building management messed up and would not give me a new badge so that i could ask for more days off and paid days off. luckily it was just part time position, but that was still not the best. not all centers are probably as unorganized as that one was, so hopefully others are better."
good,"An okay place to work, seasonal graveyard and didn't make enough money to stay, coworkers where kind of jaded, really repetitive tasks and role assignments"
good,Amazon is a fast pace job that is always looking for innovated ideas.  Long hours but they went by fast as you were always moving.  I enjoyed the people most
good,When working for amazon you must be ready to endure increasing pace of work while employees are constantly hired and fired.  While compensation used to be generous recent changes have eliminates several bonuses and stock options.
good,"I enjoy working for Amazon but there are quite a few things that need to be change. This is a fast past environment and hard in the body and occasionally the mind as well. Don’t walk in thinking this will be a picnic in the park because it won’t. Work hard, stay positive."
good,"Work with all the latest AWS tools which is fun.  Get used to running at a speed of 8-9 out of 10, non-stop.  The engineers are treated more like livestock then humans.  Not much caring goes around and work is a constant pile-on with unrealistic expectations.  The people were generally nice and smart but it was overall just a depressing experience.   It's a first-world trap due to the high pay, but it will be a trade-off for you happiness."
good,I was lucky and landed a temp / seasonal job in Large Items Dept.  Good people.  Spent most of my time on the phone with specialty careers tracking down lost shipements.
good,"Working for AMazon can be interesting but ask a lot of time, after work theres not time for any avtivites because the work is really intense with really short brakes."
good,Amazon is a nice place to work if you don't mind doing repetitive work. I learned a lot about logistics and working with others. Some management could be very rude sometimes because they don't know how to talk to others with respect. hardest part about the job is working on your feet for almost 10 hours and getting hit with MANDATORY over time. Management is very strict when it comes to break times you get 2 15 minuet breaks ( which they cut down to 10 minuets because they want you to walk back during your break)
good,I worked under a company who is working with Amazon and I received no training and I worked through by my experience of assembling at home. The managers tend to tell me to figure out by myself and hope it works so I hope my experience of working in Amazon will be helpful for me someday.
good,"Mitarbeiter waren alle sehr nett, paar Manager waren mega unfreundlich ansonsten Atmosphäre usw auf der Arbeit war Gut"
good,"we get to wark th ebosses tell us what to do , we do it, and when the work is done we either take a break or ask what other work needs to be done. If therre is nothing gong on, and we are looking for what to do next , the bosses ask us we we want to go home, or retape the floor."
good,"If you get sick you get points, 6 points and you're out. Each shift missed is 1.5 points. You cant flip your schedule during peek, I've had to cancel my educational classes because of my work schedule and until december 25th, I do not have the options to change my schedule. It's also performance based, so scan fast or else you get points."
good,I only worked at Amazon for about 6 weeks - it was a seasonal position so I didn't have an opportunity to really get a feel for the company or it's culture
good,stood on your feet for almost the entire shift scanning product. it was very fast paced and a lot of strain from standing in one place at a time. overall though the pay was good and a lot of hours
good,A typical day at Amazon during peak season is in a fast paced environment. I have honed my skills in Yard Management System (yms). Currently management gets a C rating because of the number of managers i have had.
good,"no work life balance, repetitive and mundane work. not really any upward mobility unless you have technical experience or software skills or are willing to relocate"
good,"Amazon Robotics is an organizational disaster - a couple of people in the management hierarchy usurped the tops and everyone else haz to suck it up. Corporate HR, please take notice."
good,So much walking made me feel 20 years older. Needed new shoes every 2 to 3 months. The repetition of the job gave me tendonitis. Changed mangers every few months.
good,"Would not be a bad job for a young person.  However the work was very physical and long.  The norm is 10 hour days, four days a week with, at times voluntary overtime of 10 hours but at other times mandatory overtime of 10 hours."
good,"Fulfillment Centers work environments are different from Prime Now Centers. In Fulfillment Centers you need to learn ""a"" task with the option to learn more (smile) if you want. Do your task fairly well and management won't talk to you. Big ""factory"" mindset."
good,"Job is for a younger person.  If you managed to stay there long enough, you know the system, if not...too bad. Favoritism was evident after a couple of days on the job. Minimal training then your thrown to the wolves."
good,A typical work day is about 8 hours with two fifthteen minute breaks and one thirty minute lunch break. I learned to how to work at a fast pace and how to operate the slam area. Management is tough and in your face.The work culture is laid back at times and very freindly. The toughest part of the job was being asked to do things that other people were trianed for but not doing it. I really enjoyed interacting with my co-workers.
good,Really fast paced and great benefits. Need to make sure you are making rate at all times. Also family life has been interrupted by working so many hours and overtime during peak as well.
good,"You're responsible for your time, basically you can't be late more than a certain amount of times or you'll be terminated. Hours are set and you must work 40 hrs a week or you'll be in trouble. Using the bathroom is a hassle, you literally can't go unless a supervisor covers you."
good,For a part time job it was okay. The shifts went by quickly and I liked all the walking around. What I didn't like was working with all the people that were not interested in working hard. They were there just to get a paycheck.
good,"When I first started at amazon, I liked it. The managers were nice and the atmosphere was relaxed. Then the old managers left to go to other locations and they were replaced with horrible managers - managers who made coming to work a dreadful experience."
good,Loved my job loved the work happy with my hours. Emergency came up had to leave out of the country. Was told after a year I could reapply same position and now they're not accepting my application. Very disappointed was told I could do and wouldn't have any problems and now they're not even interested in my application. Not happy!
good,"The culture at Amazon was really laid back. Co-workers were awesome but the leaders were too inconsistent with one another. One told you to go left, the other told you to go right."
good,"Very fast paced, busy place to work."
good,The holiday season begins around black Friday for their employees. They will hire a bunch of temps for the whole month of December and offer extra overtime as well but you cannot work more than 7 hours there. The pace is crazy all the management cared about was meeting quota for the day. The break was cut short numerous times so that we could get back to work. If you don't have a job this is a good option but I wouldn't recommend doing it long term especially if you reside in a warmer climate area. The heat can be overwhelming at times.
good,"If u want fair treatment and good management, Amazon is not for u with the favoritisms and petty supervisors, and the making of new rules as they go to benefit them."
good,"Typical day when you're in the singles packing department, you're pushing numbers all day at a high rate. There's a very high chance of developing a permanent work injury in this environment so you need to be able to pace yourself accordingly. It's a business, no one is anything but a number. If you're interested in figuring out what a warehouse is like and how to run a business, this is a good place to figure things out. The work culture isn't too bad but you can't interact with people much due to everyone having their own responsibilities and the way everyone was isolated. Hardest part of the job was amount of intensity you had to apply on a consistent basis. The most enjoyable part of working here was fighting for voluntary time off amongst coworkers."
good,"Liked managements coaching mentality for teaching employees and correcting employees.  Safety or employee welfare does not seem to be a big concern for Amazon, as employees go through security to leave the building but not to enter."
good,"Poor management and poor moral of employees, they hire alot of inexperienced managers that do not  have people skills. I feel because you do not have a degree does not make you unqualified for a management position."
good,it Has good benefits but I would not work for The warehouse again no career advancements. It’s easy to get fired from the job and I would not recommend my family or friends to work there
good,"job requires a lot of walking through 2 block long factory, so it can be bad on your feet. Team leads and management wasn't as helpful at explaining things which i usually will learn things quickly."
good,"Good place to work, but I have to drive two hours one way to get to work.  Wears and tears on vehicle."
good,"For Some people, Amazon could be a great job. My main issue with it is that it is basically soul sucking. You walk at least 10 miles a day, picking random items off the shelf to put into a tote and send off to shipping. All the while having to maintain a rate of 100%+ to goal, which FYI they don't tell you at the beginning what they want you to pick at or what the goal is. Try to pick AT LEAST 125 items per hour. And for people who are sociable, this job isn't for you. You can get yelled at by management for trying to talk to someone. You are forced to pick fast and silent and pray that you don't have a terrible pick path, which they haven't revised at my location in 2 YEARS. And the silence gets to you. You're not allowed to listen to music, and they don't have any background music playing, unless you enjoy the sounds of heavy machinery. It really is true what they say: you are treated like a robot here, like just another cog in the machine. But like I said, it's not for me, but it might be great for you."
good,Its not a bad job just boring to be honest. You don't interact with barely anyone. Also the hours did not work for me. I worked from 6pm until 4am so I missed alot with my kids.
good,Extremely competitive with high performance expectations. Always on 24/7 with the goal posts always moving. Scaling globally through self-service or automation critical.
good,"J'ai eu la chance d'avoir une bonne équipe et de faire des rencontres formidables, c'était une motivation à se rendre au travail. "
good,the compensation was decent being that i don't have much responsibility. my manager would let me know if something was wrong with my rate or quality..
good,Pays some of the bills. It is hard work. You will be on your feet for the full 10 hours a day. Most people there are nice. It has decent health benefits when it is not an emergency situation.
good,"Forced to work harder and get more done as time goes by. Been there over a year and work load is almost doubled with the same pay rate, same hours and the same amount of workers or even less since I started working here."
good,It's a job not a career if your in college or need to catch up various types of bills maybe but it is a high pressure rate based job who always ask for mandatory overtime doesn't really work with family life.
good,pays good but morale is low. You'll quickly feel drained and regularly go home exhausted. The benefits and stock options are great it can be a career if desired. stick it out for at least 2 years for the stock.
good,It was a good job but it was hard to commute. It was a huge warehouse. The interview process was fairly easy. I would recommend them to anyone. I would love another chance to work with the company again
good,"I would work 6 days a week putting in lots of overtime doing over 200 stops daily. It got to the point where I started rescuing term for helping out those in need that could not complete their deliveries . It got very stressful since I was doing 200 plus on top of that 25 - 30 stops from other drivers keep in mind without taking my lunch ..  Dispatch would message your own personal phone to verify how you were doing constantly being paranoid if you would have time to help out other drivers ...  That was a huge disappointment because you were done with your route and still had to help other drivers if you did not comply to those terms dispatch would threaten you with a write up... what??? ridicules much... As far as my time working with amazon money with overtime would help pay the bills. According to my review I am being very blunt with my experience working for Amazon, but if you would like to work here give it a shot.. Keep in mind it is fast paced and stressful at times but thats any job..."
good,"Move to a different post at least every day."
good,"Amazon was okay. If i ever need extra money on the side, i would definitely return. However i would not make a career out of it. Does not seem to have advancement opportunities"
good,"just started training for vcs."
good,"An environment for young whom is new to the work place. Micro-managing environment with few opportunity for advancement and without merit increases."
good,the job is good until the stock of the facility gets too high (happens near holidays or sales and last months) then the management will tell you they understand but will not lower rate requirements. Of all the people you are hired on with (13-18) it is normal for only one to make it past a month.
good,Don’t pay for the work I do. Normally doing 2/3 person jobs by myself most days. Don’t mind working nights but managers have no idea what they are doing.
good,"It’s a job can’t complain, every department has a rate you must meet. If you are a good worker and just come to work and not BS then this job is for you. Benefits right away and nice big break rooms and a good selection of food to buy. Most warehouses are 4-10’s but newer ones are 5-8’s. Peak schedule can be a little annoying since there are black out days but the extra hours worked just means more money."
good,"Most of the job is manual labor and there are always tight deadlines. The culture is extremely unique - low-level associates are encouraged to address management with ideas for improvement, although most do not. For a better understanding of the company culture, look up Amazon's 13 Leadership principles. This job isn't for everybody... Performance under pressure is key and practices often change."
good,"The managers, supervisors, and coworkers were all really nice. They would always ask you how you were doing. One supervisor in particular was really nice and talked to me multiple times a day. My only complaint is the unfairness of making rates because no matter how fast I went, I was never able to seem to make it."
good,Always changing day to day. Slow then fast fast then slow. Trying to keep your job is key. Time management is essential. Hardest part is dealing with a team that does  not understand the word team. Helping people
good,you sign up they tell you will work full time hours i was barley getting 22hours a week and they force you to leave hours early before your shift end.
good,If you enjoy being on your feet all day with cheap insurance this is your place. Do not even have the expectation of compensation from any injuries if they do happen.
good,"People at Amazon are often two-faced and looking out for themselves. This behavior is more often rewarded than penalized, and the company does not even address the fact that this is a problem. It's not in the core values."
good,"Working at Amazon is about moving fast. All they care about is the packages. The employees get treated like trash and the supervisors seat around and do nothing all day. Also, they do not help when needed."
good,its an ok place to work not the best but not the worst. low wages no care for employees but its a  job and its stable and you will never not have a job
good,"Rate is very important there, if you don't make rate you can get a write up. You do the same thing all day everyday. You are on your feet all day. They want you to work like robots. If you get hurt and go to AMCARE they act like you get hurt on purpose they are not thinking that you get injured just doing the same thing every day."
good,"Fast paced work, requiring a lot of hustle to keep up with the volume of packages.  Mostly good group of people to work with, but not a place for low motivation slackers.  Some good managers, but not very experienced.  Also not a good place to try to advance if you are an older worker.     "
good,"Better for you if you make friends with management and make yourself seen. Very unorganized structure at the Boston office. Most managers don't know your job or how to help complete it efficiently. They only send you to other trainers and make sure you attend sessions. Never ensure your training are effective. If you want to over work yourself  and also be social with managers to get ahead then its a good place. If you want fair work load and to be who you are then you may not keep your job or ever advance here. You have to go above and beyond to be noticed. Sometimes that is good, but its also good to reward those who are consistent and can work with coworkers, not just managers."
good,"Les conditions de travail sont très dures, certains postes demandent beaucoup d'efforts physique."
good,Amazon is a great place to work if you just want to come in and work and have no relationship with anyone and just want the paycheck. I worked there for three months and my manager never spoke a word to me. It feels like you are just a number and they can replace you at any time.
good,"have to be able to lift 50 lbs, stand for up to 10 hours, and walk at least 3 miles a day; 10 hour shifts with 30 minutes for lunch; management limited break times"
good,working in the grocery store (Sprouts) was fun.  Enjoy setting up the orders.Enjoy working with customers and cco-workers..  The training was fantastic
good,Focus all on management with hourly paid workers little chance of advancement only there to do the grunt work and make the management look good. Management only worried about ticking the boxes even those that help with improving there teams skills little chance of progression as management positions filled by graduates with little or no work experience.
good,"Fast paced,fast training,management was fair. They attempted to provide a fun and safe place to work. The labor is hard,the pay is low with a very small chance for advancement in salary growth. I enjoyed meeting new people."
good,Nice managers that try to keep an upbeat atmosphere surrounding it's work force. The temperature varies with the outside climate so make sure you dress for the season.
good,"This was a fast paced enviroment. The managers changed every three months and were not well trained. The rate set for people to meet was not attainable. People received two fifteen minute breaks and one 30 minute break. The breakroom took 5 minutes to get to. There was no assistance lifting anything over 50lbs, even if you asked. You were treated as a number and as if you didnt matter. Write up were given for talking, not making rate,  bathroom breaks. And the bathrooms were monitored and time."
good,"Culture is robotic not for humans if you pass your break for few minutes and your performance is not over 95% you are in a dead end, coworkers are very competitive in not professional ways and managers do not care about you at all, seen people crying almost every week over the micromanage culture, no training unless you teach yourself, no working tools and this will be taken over you ...careful !"
good,The stress of not making rate can sometimes be frustrating and I don't feel on site management can be effective with the policies set by upper management
good,It has its ups and downs. Some of the employees were treated fairly and others were not. I still think it is a great job to have but maintaining the job is a bit difficult for some due to the fast pace nature of the job.
good,"Walked in to clock in, brief stretching before the start of the shift, announcements, then on to picking for the next 10 hours. No one stands over your shoulder, you just go out to the floor and do what you were trained to do. Two 15 minute breaks, paid, and one 30 minute lunch break. 10-hour shifts."
good,"la journée commence par du picking, puis on doit remettre les colis aux chauffeurs"
good,"Amazon was an enjoyable experience but there was no change, it was the same day in and day out and the managers didnt speak fluent English so communication was problematic"
good,basically a god place to work if you come in and mind your business and do your work. if you have interest of moving up there is always someone standing in your way keeping you from it.
good,"Great place to stretch and learn."
good,"not a fun place to work."
good,"The typical day at work was very restricted and required excessive hours, and had to do voluntary and mandatory overtime. The workplace culture was indeed diverse and the hardest part of the job was to unload trucks for the first 5 hours."
good,Absolutely hot and cold. No A/C. Not enough staff. To much labor not enough pay. Don't believe the bonus because that's added into your pay and you won't get a raise.
good,"Good company.There are allot of thing to be emproved.I work here since 2014, but i am sure things could go better then use to be.Management could make some improvements."
good,"Good for a temporary job as the wage is good especially if you are doing night shifts."
good,"its was a ok type of job , allot of lifting and moving packages along with sorting . only fun when you have coworkers you are comfortable working with ."
good,If you need a busy active occupation this is it. Theres alot of moving around as a picker or packer and you can ask for that title they will easily give it to you.
good,"A typical day at work started with physical stretching to prepare for the extreme physical constant labor for 10 hours. Management though appeared professional really lacked on consistent flow of employment information and the HR was really no help with problems, both with employee interaction or physical toil. the hardest part of the job was standing on my feet 10 constant hours a day with really few to no breaks and the constant management tracking of where you were at all times. the most enjoyable part of the job was the pay, overtime pay and benefits. if you are talking enjoyable about doing the job, constant physical labor that never stopped."
good,You're on your feet for 10-12 hours a day. Very strict on break times. Must be on time coming back from breaks. Must make rate. Easy to get fired. Loud environment.
good,"The work is easy, the do give you some free items and or food to help motivate you throughout the day/week. Management cares more about the numbers than the people. Only raise that is given is when you move from white badge to blue badge."
good,"The workplace itself needs to be reevaluated. Some managers are nice, but then you have those who are power hungry and I strongly believe the people in HR and the ERC could do better to show they care. Especially when it comes to my leave and my accommodation."
good,"The only thing is that the pay rate is too low, but it is a good environment to work in as far as warehouses go.  I am no longer there but I want to go back in a different position or location. I do not like the revolving door Joliet has."
good,Easy job nothing to complain there. They do treat you like you are a child though and if you get sick they have no remorse. If you get hurt and have to leave they take your time for leaving when it their fault you got hurt. They work you for long hours without a break and they lie about the volume.
good,I worked here briefly as I was in university in 2015 summer trying to get by. I was working with friends as I had heard of it before it was ok not too back braing as I was a packer. We usually finished our line of work quickly and was waiting around for more work. Does get boring sometimes and I had to take strolls around to kill time.
good,They encourage to work hard. 10 hours a day for four days.Hardest part is that It is not challenging enough for me. I am used to being a teacher and a classroom setting. I love to deal with people.
good,Amazon is good as company but it depends on process you work. Seller Support is not at all good. Management at seller support is not approachable. Monetary benefits and growth development is there however too much pressurizing.
good,"I enjoyed working there. It is physically demanding but I didn't mind it. I looked at it as being paid to go to the gym to workout and seeing results. There are heavy bags filled with packages that can weigh up to 50+ pounds. What you have to do is place them on baker's racks in the order you picked them from top to bottom and left to right. Then you have to stage them in their designated areas. Sometimes you may need to load them into the delivery vans. Each shift has their own specific jobs they do. I just described my shift (5:30 am -10:30 am). Great place, I loved it and fast paced."
good,"I enjoyed the always busy type of work because it made the day go quicker."
good,"same thing everyday, never any variation, and if targets are not met hen you are disciplined even when its not your fault, the agency coaches don't have a clue what they are doing and the agency expects people to listen to what they are saying and learn from it"
good,"A long day of work, late at night. For 2 hours, we either received packages and put them on shelves or sorted them into bags to be sent out. We received and unpaid lunch and then worked for 3 hours before getting a break and then we worked the last 3 hours until we left."
good,"Amazon is a very fast-paced, loud, and crowded place to work. They don't play games here. You want to work, that's what you're going to get work, work, and more work. The money is good here, that's why they make you work so hard for it, but you'll have to be very dedicated to this job and prove yourself if you want to see the benefits, which are very good by the way."
good,"Amazon has long hours, many supervisors, lots of work, people  get fired everyday for small stuff, lots of drama and gossip, robots will have most of these jobs in the future."
good,"As with many large companies, your experience will largely depend on your individual team, especially the manager, and your org. As a contractor, I was there to perform a specific job and did not necessarily get to experience the range of mentoring and task variety that FTE employees may enjoy.  However, in general the people who oversaw my contractor teams were supportive, helpful and provided good training. As a contractor, I had 1-2 weeks of intense all day training.  After which, I spend the days doing the task related to my project, though there were usually short meetings for check-ins and follow up training. As a contractor, I was generally not allowed to work remotely but my hours were flexible after the training week was over. In my case, all my tasks were very metrics based and our success was generally how well we could meet a set daily goal. "
good,"Experienced employees seemed to leave to find jobs with better salaries and benefits.   There are paths to advancement in Amazon, but those are difficult to follow when such a large workforce is competing for a very small number of open positions."
good,"Subcontracted subcontractors, spent all day working on spread sheets gathering data and not on our actual job (IT). Our boss's sneaked us into events so we could enjoy working there but the days were hellishly long and the weeks felt endless."
good,They need to offer more pay to make people want to stay. They don't offer competitive pay but they have great benefits. The managers are number driven.
good,Great place for advancement and growth professionally and personally. To much physical work not enough pay and the culture doesn't make it any easier.
good,"Fine company but type of work was not for me.  I worked as a seasonal package sorter and we were always busy which was great."
good,"If you can handle being a mindless robot that can always deliver the numbers that they want. You will be loved here. It all comes down to numbers at Amazon and that can be hugely stressful for everyone that makes the work environment not that happy of a place. Also, I've seen great workers that don't quite get the numbers pushed out because of it."
good,Amazon is a good company for someone who work in a factory warehouse before they are very fast pace and they don’t give train you like they should consider your dealing with a danger Pit machine
good,"---------------------------"
good,"Amazon works their seasonal employees very very hard; and if you don't make the cut within the first few days, they don't keep you. The transition from their temp agency to Amazon full time isn't open to everyone."
good,"This place sucked to work at. Unfair treatment,  they ramp up expectations to avoid giving bonuses. An overall dissatisfying  experience, unless you really like to brown nose."
good,"An sich ganz okay aber es wird viel zu viel Stress gemacht und zu viel auf Zahlen geachtet, schafft man die Zahlen nicht wird man einfach ersetzt."
good,"Great time off in offseason. Great benefits. Not so great pay for the sought after shifts, and managers seem a bit inexperienced. Hardest part of job is walking miles for 10 hours every day and staying focused while doing it."
good,"Expectations are high, it is a fast paced and challenging work environment. There are many talent coworkers to lean on for support. Be ready to work hard, have fun and make history."
good,"You never get any holidays off except for Christmas, and if you drive an hour away, it is 12 hours a day total, which is taking a lot of time from your family."
good,"Amazon.com is the largest, and best online retailer in the world, that does not come easy. It is fast paced, physical, often boring and not very fulfilling work."
good,"Alot of pressure from agency and you never knew when you were going to get sacked, EU people are favoured and manage to get all the best jobs and everyone else just gets shafted with the rubbish jobs"
good,"after a while they put games on the floor by the break area, and in the break room. The people we worked with as far as employees were a odd bunch. They would talk all the time and never got punished for it. The team leaders were great and we worked hard for them. Security was very strict when we first started, but then they turned the security off. After that everything went down hill. The temperature in the building was very hot, so they provided water fountains at each belt area. I would still work for them if they would make the pay rate reasonable for all. Overall it was a good place to work and would be better if the work situation was improved. They did a great Job with Safety and fire drills."
good,Good start and great stocks but Work tends to tiring and so jobs have better job stress based on different positions. Area Manager outbound is the worst position to be in.
good,Amazon has lowest compensation rate compared to any progressing company. Amazon has plenty of money but is unwilling to pay employees what they deserve.
good,"The money isn't the worst but the job they give is soul-crushingly boring. I counted items for almost 5 hours straight with very little breaks and long walks across the huge warehouse when you do receive them. You dress pretty casual and the benefits of full time are there, but boy is full-time a pain. If you really need the job, they hire just about anyone but get ready to feel like a complete robot while you work."
good,"Boring.  I pick items from warehouse and bring to dock.  Its boring. "
good,I started at Zappos. Then Amazon took over. tHey had a deal with Zappos to keep culture for 5 years. Everythimg was going well until end of 5 years. Then everything changed.Team members were unhappy. people quitting or getting fired like crazy. Was not the place I wanted to work at anymore.
good,This company helps emploee to move next step some specific industry for paying tuition or another. So it is temporary job mostly of them. Then very diversity nationality and culture.
good,A lot of long hours doing the same thing. Very repetitive.
good,"Depending where you are in the business and who your manager is, the company can be fantastic. While there is a main goal and general consensus on how to get there, many people take ""bias for action"" and other leadership principles too far. The competitiveness and demand for 120% is entirely too much for a long term career, particularly in the staffing industry."
good,"It is okay as a first job or stepping stone and there is advancement available there, but the hours will get to you and the work environment that one is subjected to was not worth it to me. Also felt unsafe in the warehouse."
good,the bathrooms were disgusting and the people i worked with smelled terrible and my manager was a 23 year old punk. i was fired for no reason and called on the phone to tell me i had been fired while on vacation.
good,"it is a fast paced enviroment"
good,typical days at work were when bosses are not in the mood you would get the brunt end which is very not fair. but the wage was very good for the work.
good,"Its easy money for easy work. As long as you abide by the rules and focus on working, you should be fine. Management is a huge issue but if its not a big deal for you, its a cool place to work."
good,"Cool job to have after getting out of school, but management can be a lot better. It's a quick-paced job and it can get stressful at times. If you do well enough you could end up learning something in another area."
good,I loved working for Amazon during the Holiday Season. It was such a great fit for me to make extra money and at the time I already had a full time job so the 4 hours they needed was fine. I soon grew with this company and became full time.
good,It is very tuff work if your working the night shift. Day time is easy work. Pay is only $12 starting for temp workers. $13 for permanent workers.n Only 3 05 hours a day
good,"The hours were appropriate but did not last the 39 weeks."
good,Work Life balance was tough however it was a good place to work with great benefits. Con is the HR department does not communicate with staff as to what is going on.
good,Be on time. Be aware of the safety rules because that will get u terminated. Willing to work and learn from others. Great place to start for first job.
good,"I have worked at Amazon for two years now and although the work is easy, my sites lacks structure, managements and some nights equipment. If we had managers who enforced rules, it would make associates who actually work hard feel appreciated. So many managers have come and go which says a lot."
good,"Hard work, very productive, long hours but room for advancement if you want it. Wok/life balance can be difficult at times and you cant make any plans from thanksgiving to Christmas."
good,pay is good but its not worth your sanity or your health. It is a good seasonal job. Beyond that I would suggest you do it at your own risk. Very high turnover rate.
good,I do not wish to leave any review except for  its a great place to work and room to excel in a career. Very fast pace work environment with meeting your deadlines.
good,Across the world amazon is know a the biggest e commerce site but to make it the biggest eCommerce site many employees are losing their work/life balance.certain time shout on their sub ordinate to get relief fro the frustration.
good,I liked working there.  I just ended up getting burnt out. I worked the inbound dock and sometimes receive.  What i saw was if you did your job as best and quickly as you could you were fine. I loved working peak as they played music and always had employee engagement.  I just think they need to get more competitive with their pay.
good,"Everything goes smooth"
good,"I worked in warehouses and factory`s and earned a lot of experience. My last job was at Amazon, where I managed to evolve quite fast, in a brief period. I was trained for admin and yard marshal, I learned very quickly how to deal with Amazon system (sending report`s, making settings for different parcels, checking the drivers and the parcels). My responsibilities in this role included providing face-to-face interaction, with all the drivers regarding the parcels, as well as assisting on the floor with stock movements. This position has given me key employability skills, while also allowing me to experience working in a professional and fast-paced work environment. As a Yard Marshal, I had to take care of the good running of the cars inside the yard using the health and safety rules and make sure all the parcels arrive at the right driver."
good,Managment usually has an idea of what is going on but at the first sign of trouble things fall apart. There is no communication between managers either. The shift I worked on was 12 hrs. During the holiday we had 2 weeks where we worked 60 hrs. That means 5 days in a row of 12 hr shifts. The only thing that made it worth it was the $16 plus overtime and benefits.
good,fast paced long hours benefits unfair management is all over the place some good days some bad days worker are nice the ones that aren't stuck up stay to yourself
good,"Ok for most, but as someone who spent all day on their feet the building was just too big. Lovely place, but 12 hours a day walking, just too much. Aalso security was ridiculous!!!"
good,"sorting, cars, packages. The Mangers not all , make choices which go against some of the company policy. It was fun at first than, things took a sad turn. Some of the employees are to afraid to say anything, they don't want to lose their job"
good,same thing different day. the managers only really care about your rate and nothing else. they are very rate driven and dont care about excuses. i only work there cause they pay for college
good,"Once you get over the ""dazzle dazzle"" that comes with working with this large company, you soon realize they are following standard call center protocol."
good,Amazon was an ok company to work for but they do not develop people with warehouse experience to manager level they tend to take people with any kind of degree.
good,"Overall nice place to work for, but different ways we did our job changed and we weren't getting paid more for the changes that affected us. Made it a little difficult to perform our task in a timely manner."
good,"Coworkers are great! Everyone is usually pretty nice and respectful of one another. However, management is not that great. "
good,"Good company  if you seek for career progression, but you need to be willing to work on shifts if you opt for the operations and logistics department."
good,You'll be dealing with a lot of day to day ambiguity when it comes to the amount of packages that are brought to the warehouse that day. Which can lead to a lot of stress.
good,"Great benefits, great hours (only work 4 days per week, 10 hour days, most of the time). Pay was pretty good- $13 starting on days, an extra buck for night shift, with $0.25 raises every quarter. Winter holiday, though, was absolute h*ll. 12 hour days, 6-7 days. And if you have any aspirations to ever do work beyond that where you started, forget it. They like to pretend they promote from within, but that's garbage."
good,"Management is the worst. they are all mean and most of them are waiting for you to mess up so they can write you up or get you fired. when you are working they are watching your rate and if it is to low they will write you up, so most of the time you have to hold off on using the bathroom because you don't want your rate to drop."
good,It's a decent job. The hours and start positions just become boring. This was a reasonable job to get me comfortable in a new area that I had just moved in. I needed something quick. I got hired really quick and started even quicker.
good,"-  Long shifts,"
good,"Disconnected and robotic. To big to care. Management brought in with different upbringing, backgrounds and cultures interjected into unfamiliar territories based on their resumes and are expected to lead and thrive very toxic mix. Seems to be a glass ceiling for minorities as well but because the compensation and stock options are so strong nobody is raising a hand to the issue. The positives are it is a global brand with a very strong reputation, very faced paced and changing daily. With this comes a lot of instability no time for personal connection and a lack of  quality development."
good,"I'd say that Amazon is great to go in a learn tons of whatever it is that you do. I got to work with really smart people and I felt like I had to keep up with them, which helped me sharpen my skills and decision making process."
good,"Like any big company the ""culture"" depends on which group you are in.  The Amazon stack ranking (they don't call it that) is a real problem.  I have talked to many of my friends working at Amazon who love their job, the work environment, their boss, and everything about the culture.  But in my experience the top down pressure and micromanagement that came from my direct supervisor made my job of managing my team impossible.  In addition to that the fact that every group had to find someone on their teams to get rid of made competition among managers who should be collaborating incredibly difficult to fight through.  And upper management gave only lip service to the problem."
good,"Coming from 16 years at UPS I was shocked to see this level of disorganization. Day starts with a daily briefing and assignment and then people go to work doing what they feel like.  Management is well versed in their job or company rules but have little skill directing and managing people / job functions. Upper echelon management is disconnected from sort operations, and does not change with input leaving everyone scrambling at the end of the day to get everything done.  No one has any standard for appearance so supervisors with green or red hair are not uncommon."
good,"Not very good place to work unless you have stock options. The work is nervous but well paid (if you have stock options). If not, basic salary is lower than average in the industry."
good,It was a descent work place good people working around you.Everyone's professional and respectful.I love the way they take the time to train you and train you right.
good,It wasn't a bad place to work. It's cool if you don't mind being on your feet for a few hours. The management was terrible. Poor communication and lots of confusion. One day they make a rule and the next day it changes. Lots of favoritism. You might get sent home early if they have too many workers. The pay was decent.
good,"Pay is a little on the low side, not by any means enough to live off of. Very relaxed but albeit fast paced job. Managers are friendly but when they choose who to promote I don't think they are too sure on what they are doing. At my location you can expect to work between 5-7 hours, although I've heard other locations are less. If under 5 hours you get 15 min paid break, over 5 hours you get 30 min unpaid break."
good,"10 hour shifts, 30min lunch, two 15min breaks but feels like 5mins not even because you have to walk to break room which is far from wherever you are working."
good,"I truly enjoyed working for amazon, it was a fast paced position. I was constantly busy while I was there. the only downfall was that it was a temporary position. I did last longer then most seasonal help though but like all seasonal positions it had to come to an end. the only bad part of the job was the company was not very organized. the bins were very messy and you had to go all over the place just to find one product."
good,Management doesn't work with you. They can write you up when you are not at work and not tell you. Then come to you and say you're not meeting the production quota but fall to view that they move you from area to area aka cross training so you are never in your area all the time.
good,"Ok to work for, but Manager leads through Intimidation and Retaliation. If you cross the Manager you can count on it you will be fired for something. Rules state you get a verbal warning, then you get a write-up then a final, not in Maintenance, you go straight to a final."
good,Level 4 and above are good paying positions. Level 3 and below are underpaid. Many of the departments are very repetitive and very stressful. There are some really good co-workers within the company as well as some good managers.
good,"Worked scanning packages. Breaks are very short since it will take 5 min to walk to break, and 5 min back. Extremely physical, I could barely walk by the end of the shift. This was very fast paced, but is a good temporary job. Unfortunately, they usually only offer part-time positions."
good,Fast-paced environment yet very political management structure. Hard workers get left behind. Career advancement is a toss up depending on your manager.
good,"The workplace is pretty fast. The managers barely even know you.. they go by the face and name on their laptop (which they carry around all day). You are hardly recognized there. On the bright side, the pay is good and you work plenty on hours (40-50 a week)."
good,"A regular day get in and wait for instruction of what needs to be the plan for the day.  Learned for what i  follow in how to be a lead. Manager should be putting more attention on workers production. All kind cultures are join to work, learning and knowing each other is the best part, sharing sides of culture.  To make all our hrs of work would e the hardest part of working for amazon. All you learn from the kind of company and management  and about your job is the most enjoyable part is educated you about something diferent"
good,"Every Big fishes are getting cheaper day by day and not ready to hire full Time ."
good,"At amazon you're constantly on your feet and once they give you a break by time you sit, 2 minutes later you have to go back to work. they train you yes but after that they dont help you or even pay attention to you."
good,"You are on your feet in 0 hour shifts, depending on you job you may be able to sit a moment and you may not. Advancement in  Company is tough to do. Its a job for someone that is in college or single. Not for a married or older person unless you just had to it. About reaching and getting rates so can be very stressful"
good,some times you have work and some days you don't have much or they will just send you home. if your lucky you can get vto.
good,"They offer a decent pay, and a nice schedule. There is very little advancement, and after 2 years you hit a pay cap that won't increase. "
good,"Quand nous arrivions nous avions pour habitude de nous échauffer dans la bonne humeur , les managers étaient très cool"
good,"Flex is wholely app based."
good,"Where to start?? I really like working here as far as I love being apart of a big company, but they treat you like a number and expect you to be a machine. You have a rate of what you are supposed to do an hour and some of the managers listen to you but don’t hear you! If it wasnt for the pay and benefits I wouldn’t of even started here. I feel like it would be so much better if they took their associates in consideration or if it was an union"
good,Limited hours off and do not work with your schedule if you are a student. Not bad but not ideal either. Pretty good pay but the work was depressing seeing everyone around you crushed by reality. Working two jobs to make ends meet was pretty eye opening for me to see.
good,"Working at Amazon is a twisted game of Monopoly. External hires to work in critical roles is very bad for business. Also, very hard to get promoted within due to their myopic perception of their Tier 1 associates."
good,"Amazon will fire you for things irrelevant to your work, and they won't give you an explanation as to why they actually fired you. Management seems to only care about their career advancement and it's dog eat dog."
good,"Lot to learn, one of the best place to work and top level management is helping. "
good,Data Driven Culture - Highly cost focused with multiple and shifting priorities. Heavily reliant on IT software applications and less focused on process controls.
good,I worked for amazon for three years in total. 2 years as a picker while performing indirect jobs in my spare time and 1 year in management training new pickers coming into the building. it was an ok place to work but management is more about favorites than anything.
good,I found the job to be more fun than it was stressful at times.  You meet a lot of interesting people and see a lot of interesting things.  The only issue I faced was that I didn't get paid very well and that doesn't change very quickly.
good,This job is for someone who doesn’t like to do much. The work is easy and at times was fun just wasn’t for me. The manager on my floor was great. And everyone that worked for the company was very nice.
good,".From early in the morning to late at night you get two 15min breaks and an hour lunch, you do the same things day in and out depending on department."
good,"The job itself isn't hard, move box A to location A.  However, it's so fast paced that a shift (4 hours) feels like a full 8-hour shift.  If you schedule yourself for 2 shifts a day, your feet are going to be bricks when you get home.  Add in the fact that Amazon regularly ""Flexes"" up an hour, so your shifts often become 5 hour slogs, and you barely get 30 minutes before the next shift."
good,"On any given day you are required to make 'rate' which they monitor every day and if you don't make it, you're out the door. Breaks are 15 minutes scan to scan, which means you better hope you're close to the door or your break is going to be VERY short, (if you don't make it back to your designated first scan you will be talked to about it). Honestly, it's only the people you meet and some of the benefits that make the job worth it."
good,"Was an interesting place to work at."
good,"A lot of overtime, gave you a lot of pto, worked long hours you are not able to pick your shifts they are given to you, a lot of security you're always being watched, managers don't care about you."
good,got up in morning got to the agency got there transport to amazon went in went to the locker room put my jacket and my bag in locker locket it then came out scan my finger go red get searched go green go in get head set sign in go were it tells you now you walking for time 1 hour lunch and 2 15 min you can take your 15 in when ever you like up to you.
good,fast paced work environment. Very long hours and physically demanding. Have minimum rates to meet in most departments. They do offer benefits and PTO hours
good,"Standing alone at a station and counting inventory for 10 hours a day, no music, just factory noise. Decent health ins benefits though. Little to no human interaction."
good,"Jest dobrze Ale jest jeszcze wiele do poprawy.."
good,Enjoyed the fast pace but this was only seasonal for 4 months. They did exercises at beginning of day and after lunch and provided free bottles of water to keep from getting cramps.
good,"Repetitive work and rare communication with people."
good,The company brings in a lot of people because they let them go fast and frequently plus the way they treat people make quite a few leave quickly after getting hired. Plus they let people go that will put up with how they ae treated by them.
good,"Its a good job to have and they give you all the benefits but I feel that its a type of job that says ""I give you everything that you need so just do what I say"" basicly."
good,Very hard to make the required hourly rate. The hourly rates are set very high and difficult to reach and maintain. The warehouse work is physically demanding.
good,"NO FULL TIME FOR WAREHOUSE ASSOCIATES."
good,"For the state of Georgia, Amazon does not pay enough hourly wage for the production they mandate on their employees. The benefits are great but do not compensate the low hourly wage."
good,"I enjoyed parts of my job, but felt under appreciated at times, in the way that what I accomplish is never enough. I could be at the top of the hour on stowing making rate but not good enough, they always want more and more and more. Limited restroom breaks although we are encouraged to drink a lot of water due to fast paced job. Stressed out, long commute. What really made me want to quit was the lack of organization. Temps would be hired on and automatically sent to the best positions in the warehouse, while all the Amazon full time employees rot in Stow and pick which are the worst positions in my opinion and super hard to transfer, HR NEEDS TO GET ON THE SAME PAGE! They say one thing then flip flop. Tried to transfer numerous times was made wait months and then never notified that transfer didn't go through."
good,"Typical day at work, sometimes stressful and flexible. Hard labor expect so much from you but do not pay you what you deserve. It has oppurtunities like career help."
good,The position that i have now is a Field Transportation Specialist is very competitive but positive and uplifting and motivating to help you want more in life to be successful.
good,"The opportunity for moving up is minimal and discriminant. The favoritism is apparent among managers and upper staff. There was a lack of communication in regards to everyday objectives and goals. It's a place you want to work if you're saving up, young with no experiences or would like to go to school. As far as being a long term career, it would be best to have an alternative or better selection altogether."
good,"its a good place to work but they dont keep there words with the 4hrs shift we signed for. they always cut workers hours. if you are ready to work here you have to get another job to add to it, so u can be able to pay bills and take care of stuff. there managements are very polite and friendly.."
good,"The longer I worked there the more lost I got. Management continued to change their minds on what we were to do had us put something somewhere one day and then the next week moved it all back. Can't blame them too harshly though because it was a very new idea and they were just trying to get things into motion. "
good,"Amazon offers plenty benefits and a decent base pay. But the work environment is inconsistent when it comes to enforcement of safety regulations, also there are countless demonstrations of favoritism which limits opportunity for growth/career development. The  most enjoyable portion of my time here is training new associates and having the opportunity to instill a positive understanding of a good work culture. Contradictory tendencies are often displayed within management and human resources when seeking understanding in standard/policy and changes in rate of function."
good,Working here wasn't bad but I think the managers I had weren't very good and made everything harder for us because they didn't optimize but lifting boxes is not very hard and its open so people talk to you and can meet new people
good,Amazon was really stressful. You have to meet their quota at 100 percent or you will get a write up. Many new employees did not last the week. Some did not even last the day. No help from HR. No help on a personal level.
good,"The Company was Very Arrogant and they use people..But obviously if you work hard enough and they like you it is a good place, the best thing about this job is just the wages; if you have got friends that work there with you it is a better environment but in total HR do not care about the workers as much as they make it seem, but it is a decent job if temporary."
good,"Worked as an order picker for quite sometime always had an outstanding productivity rate and denied several transfers or cross training to other departments despite having seniority for about 2 years, and watching co-workers that had been there for 2 months get accepted. The quality systems are flawed and will receive write ups for things that are out of your control.  Too much favoritism and unfairness when it came to receiving training for advancement or in-direct roles. HR always gave you a run around on concerns and always had problems with trouble tickets. Got called down for things that didn't even concern me at times or were somebodies else's mistakes."
good,"Everything was a dream at first. It went on that way for a multitude of weeks. But soon after, you learn that promotions are scarce and do not happen as regularly as they claim. the casual attire was great, but the management was never in communication, always unorganized and more than half had bad attitudes regarding work. they stayed on their phones and forced others to do their work and when it came to down to taking responsibility, the entry level workers always took the fall. never enough workers in any area and people got fired for the smallest of things.No position was permanent except managerial positions, People were constantly being moved from one position to the next."
good,It's a good paying job that requires you to work as a team and to work fast-pace. Met lots of friendly people there but management was very poor in a way that I've never talked to my supervisor.
good,"Good hourly rate, helpful staff, customers are friendly, sometimes difficult delivery locations, flexible working hours, high expectations with no contract."
good,I could not ask for a better job but the management is horrible. As long as you make rate and make friends with as many people as you can there is nothing wrong.
good,Working at Amazon wasn't stressful. I was in packing department. When you came in we always did excise to warm up. Then they would give you a work station. You start to packing.
good,this was a nice place to work i learnt alot with the running of a busy warehouse and got lots of training in all aspects of warehouse work however i only had a 12 week contract
good,Amazon has so much security you need a badge to enter the building and another to get into the Amazon suite.once your inside you have a locker to place your thing cell phones paper pens pencils sticky notes etc are all prohibited from the Amazon floor no back packs or purses either..but you can however eat lunch at your desk and bring your favorite coffee with you.the dress code is causal but i dont believe hats are allowed I the floor
good,"It four days a week with ten hour days, two fifth teen minutes breaks, and 30 minute lunch. When it peak season (Late October to Mid December) there will be mandatory over time and blackout on paid time off and vacation time."
good,Working here the pay and benefits for fulltime are great however the hours and mandatory overtime are brutal. Furthermore the medical staff only seeks to protect the company and not the health of employees. THe Human Resources department solves nothing on premise and continually relies on Corporate Hr to solve Problems.
good,Very stressful and fast paced. You have to be quick to get hours as soon as they pop up or you'll be stuck with night shifts. You don't get much for a break either unless you schedule a break in your shift times.
good,The workplace atmosphere is great. Both co-workers and managers are easy to get along with. But I found out that even though you work very hard and your productivity is on the best list you are not rewarded for it. I felt that all my hard work went down the drain because I was terminated after the high season while other people that did not have high productivity as I did got to stay. I was told that I could reapply in 3 months but I honestly I do not want to work for a company that pays so low when compared to other warehouses and you are not rewarded for your hard work.
good,"This is a job for someone looking for extra money.They do"
good,"The typical job tasks and expectations are good. They are simple, mundane, and eventually become second nature. This seems good at first, until your mind starts to wonder and eventually the lack of community seems to be more of a concern. It is hard to imagine, but for the most part the management team is somewhat unapproachable. They tend to yell, to point fingers, and to be in a very bad mood. It is of course understandable that the management staff is under a lot of pressure to meet their quotas by the end of the day in this incredibly quick paced delivery company. But this negative tension from those employees above your position tends to make the atmosphere more intense, and on top of that if one of your co-workers are slacking off or causing security violations putting yourself and countless others at risk, its hard to find the person above your station that can help or is willing. Some connections with your co-workers can be made, but because of time restraints and quotas the upper management tends to break up small talk and separate friends. In other words, no talking because it slows you down and we lose money. It is understandable that many employees tend to get carried away, and not even work. but for those few who can manage your work load and carry a conversation, the management team seems way to strict on this issue."
good,There was too much favoritism when it came to certain employees. managers were unprofessional. black out days were the worst you work your butt off for six day 12 hours a week.
good,It's a long 10 hour day on your feet making and packing boxes. i learned nothing standing in a station following computer prompts. Most of the managers I had were good people who tired to help and checked  in with packers through out the day; my last manager i never meet after he was introduced. I had no life outside of Amazon during the blackout around thanksgiving to Christmas.
good,Overall it could be a decent place to work if they didn't treat you like a modern day slave with a number ICQA).. They're expections are based on numbers on a daily basis and it's almost impossible to make rate everyday unless youre only receiving small items; which is impossible!  We can be stuck with same asin containers containing big items and they will still hold us accountable for not making rate if there are no small items.
good,"Amazon is a great company to own stock in. The returns are great, there's no reason to fear that the market will plummet and gut your stocks. But as for a place to work, expect to be worked over pretty hard. In my area, the starting wage is $13.75/hour, and pay raises only happen based on seniority. Last 6 months, you get an extra quarter."
good,The job is easy but you have certain managers that can make a job hard. The pay start is ok for someone who never made over 10. The work can go easy if you have a friend to talk to. But can be hard.
good,Very unorganized but they paid well. Its a good place to make quick money but managers and HR aren't of much help. Questions were never directly answered and managers were hard to find if you needed them. Most direction was unclear and it wasn't like I could find anybody to clear them for me.
good,"In the beginning of your shift you have a meeting ( telling you the days quota, what`s expected of us ,etc;) then we go to our stations and work for 3 hours before break which is 30 minutes . you have to clock back in at a certain time or get written up( even though its hundreds of people clocking in at the same time ). At the end of the shift if we don't make the quota we have time up( stay until its done)"
good,"They ended my 3 month contract one month early, and all others who'd been hired on a 90 day basis just before the Christmas holiday as they didn't need us anymore. Never worked harder at a job. Didn't even get a thank you or goodbye from co-workers. You get nothing as a contract employee, but permanent are highly paid and under trained/always stressed. Lack of structure."
good,"It’s ok, you’re standing all day so I recommend you wear comfy shoes. Management is somewhat alright, favoritism is definitely shown though. Pretty diverse."
good,It's great here as long as you don't depend on it as your primary source of income. The management really listens to the workers and the safety and well being is taken seriously. It's not hard to earn money here. But they don't pay enough for them to be your primary/sole source of income. They let you know almost daily that your work there should be supplementary to something else you're doing.
good,"Average 15 hour per day working overnight. Peers are very cut throat and Senior Managers have unreal expectations and lack leadership in providing vision and guidance. No work life balance, often working 60 hour a week minimum."
good,The delivery station is not like the fulfillment centers. We depend and plan on product being delivered according to schedule. If schedules aren't met it requires making personnel adjustments on the fly.
good,"very high stress to meet numbers "
good,"A typical day starts with a five-minute meeting for all associates to stretch, and hear announcements and (occasionally) production goals for the day. Associates then go to workstations that are usually not completely work-ready; work tasks are fast-paced, repetitive, and rated. Breaks are 15 minutes long so associates have two-and-a-half minutes to walk to and from the break rooms due to the sheer size of the buildings. Lunch is 30 minutes."
good,"While the pay and other benefits may improve the longer you stay with the company, the initial starting salary, combined with the intense physical labor and fairly short break times, will prove difficult to overcome at the start."
good,I have personally worked at Amazon for a year. It can be a crazy job at times 10-12 hour nights. The people there are great but if you fall behide you can lose your job. They push you really hard. In pretty much everyones opinion harder than they need to. They expect more from a person than mos.t people can give
good,"I did not enjoy working here because the environment was unprofessional, the coworkers were unintelligent and unprofessional. I was not paid fairly for the amount of hours I worked a day all day, everyday."
good,"I worked 10 hour days"
good,"Amazon is a great place to work if you are struggling to find work. Really long hours but if all you're looking for is money and don't mind what hours and days you work then its great for you. There is always plenty of overtime available at Amazon. It can be difficult to get work if you don't drive but there is different ways to get to work like buses, taxis, cycle or you can car share."
good,"In general, Amazon is a good place to work. It is very physical, so if you aren't into labor, this is not the job for you. You will work with people from all cultures and backgrounds."
good,"Coming in and getting straight to work grabbing your scanner and walking to the mods. In your first 15 minutes of being in the mod you need to stow 45 items in that time frame."
good,"their Moto is ""work hard.""  I think its incomplete, it should be work hard like slaves for little pay, don't work smart."
good,The best part of working here are the benefits! Excellent benefits for full-time employees and flexible schedules with options for paid time off and accrued vacation.
good,"If you enter as a Prime Now Associate, the only way to move up is to transfer out of Prime Now. Aside from a discount capped at $100 per year, there are absolutely no work benefits. The work schedule is incredibly flexible, but not guaranteed. Shift availability is first come first serve and caps on weekly hours fluctuate from 25-40 a week. Bottom line, this is a great side hustle and a way to make a couple extra bucks a month, but nothing more."
good,"The work seems much to mind numbing and there is not as much isolation but there still is enough to get to me. The breaks and lunch seem very short and management is very strict on breaks even though it takes a good while to get from place to place there should be plus or minus a minute or two depending on the area you are working in. The turn over rate seems high and I believe it is because people aren't satisfied and don't feel like their time is accurately compensated for the mind numbing work and there is nothing to stop management from working you to the bone. I believe the work would be much better if there was a union formed that could help the people . For example better pay, better vacation, and holidays off for high seniority people"
good,Working for Amazon certainly has the potential to be a well-paid and full career opportunity.  I only interned with them but their recent fast growth certainly leaves it open for anyone in the future interning or employed with them to be eligible for plenty of opportunities for growth within or outside the company.
good,"A typical day at work would be so bland, you had to much favoritism. Coworkers would make the day a bit better but you would have to work long hours. 7:30-6pm. So basically you are there all day. Its not what you think."
good,"you are on your feet for 10 hours a day,,it is a good paying job with 4 days on and 3 days off, nice people to work with most of the time. if you don't mind being on your feet for hours then maybe you should check them out!!!!"
good,"Overall it is okay place to work if you enjoy pressure, meeting quotas and watching others advance not because of skill but because of self promotion."
good,"its ok, could be a better place to work but again anywhere can be the same, i learned that Romania is no longer a country as all the Romanians now reside in Leicester."
good,"Amazon has great benefits if you can stand on your feet for 10 hours. Advancement is fast for young, pretty, people. They don't work with you if you have any problems with the work itself."
good,"Have to count items, picking was stressful there’s no air , breaks are short , no fun , managaers never know their job , breaks are too short , hr never helps"
good,"I started at Amazon about a month and a half ago. Going in, I thought it would be similar to my last job but with better opportunities to advance. Shortly after working here I found out that’s not the case. I got stuck in a stowing position, which I hate. Probably the most boring job you can be put on. I asked a few times if I could learn something else because I was bored. The answer was no. I went to HR to talk about transferring to a different department and was also told no you have to wait 90 days. There are a few perks to working here. They have great benefits. They have a new Mother’s room, where you can bring your breast pump on your break times or before/after work. I enjoy the other people I work with but dread going to work every day just to be bored for 10 hours."
good,Overall pay lower than other companies.  Associates do all work yet management receives bonuses.  Procedures tend to differ for each manager. You sometimes feel misled by managers.
good,"euk5 Department is worst place where i was worked"
good,"They are very focused on production and not advancement of associates internally. I like the experience here , just had hopes of being promoted and it never happened."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the diversity of the workplace. All the different cultures and languages floating around without affecting team work and productivity.
good,Amazon requires a lot out of it's leadership and is always demanding more.  Not a good work/home life balance.  Amazon is great if you're a team member but very stressful if you are in a leadership role.
good,"I really liked working here, but advancing proved to be more difficult than expected.  I have found out in multiple areas that favoritism plays a roll."
good,"Working at an Amazon Fulfillment center is incredibly monotonous, and upper, facility level management make last-minute changes to job assignment and hours with little or no notice to employees.  In general, these manager demonstrate little regard for their associates."
good,The company only offers a 4 years' package.   And they expect the employee to works for 4 years with little promotion and stagnant salary raise.   Career advancement is pretty much stagnant.
good,"With this job it is constant stress from management to keep up with a certain rate, if you can't keep up, even if it's fault on Amazon's end you get written up. If you get written up 3 times you get fired. The pay and benefits are nice however but not worth the constant stress that management puts on you."
good,Travaille à usine tout ce quilien y a de plus normal
good,"Very fast paced work environment with no shortage of exercise,  one had to quickly learn the assigned job or be moved to a different department. Decent pay within a no lulls warehouse industry, the sink or swim work ethic would not be for everybody."
good,You will do good if you are young and healthy . I enjoy the people I work with but not some of the rates that was in place. Can be a fun place to work at times
good,"Amazon is not a bad place to work, the company has a lot of money but lacks vision, and leadership not that good. However, it can get better once Amazon starts developing more leaders."
good,"They need to get rid of the point system, life happens. They need to have eight hour shifts instead of ten only for associates, and increase pay to at least 13.50 for everyone the cost of living is real"
good,"its a place to work and make money. if you dont care about moving up and love walking, this jobs is for you. great money and benefits. plus all the overtime you want. they are always open!"
good,It was just a job they come they go there’s never an in between. Mine was only just temporary but turned out to be less time than I was hoping for. Overall though it’s ok.
good,"Decent pay to start off, hard work, good time off, "
good,Having to meet high rate and quality standards makes for a stressful work environment. The company has a severe lack in advancement opportunities and it is cut-throat to try to advance.
good,Physically demanding position with low pay. Worked in hot and cold conditions. Worked as a dispatcher for Amazon delivery. Amazon delivery devices are antiquated and often malfunction.
good,You are unable to maintain a work/family balance with 10 hours shifts. Amazon should provide 8 hour shifts for associates to have the ability to have an evening to spend with there families.
good,There were too many people trying to be in charge. The culture there was bad. They would always find something wrong somewhere and then hassle you. The company was all about the upper management and NOT the workers getting things done.
good,Amazon is a place that gives you opportunity with the career choice program but it has become very hard to work for. The amount of work required is too much compared to the pay .
good,"Day was long and hard at times, didn't learn much, management was fine front half;back half was way more lax. Culture was relaxed under some managers, super sticked and stressful under others. Hardest part was I couldn't pick or have a say in what I wanted to do. Most enjoyable part was working by myself."
good,"If you like to work long hours and be underpaid, this may be the place for you. The benefits are great and the managers are awesome but the high turnover, long hours, mandatory overtime, and physically exhausting work make this a hard place to stay at."
good,The work is not for everyone. You have to be motivated and have confidence. The management as a whole is lacking in personality and helpfulness. The overall spirit is one of stress and discontent. Once the new wears off every one just stays for the pay or the benefits. It is not a location that is willing to help someone that they don't want to.
good,You will be treated like a number on a spreadsheet from day 1 and they know you can be replaced any moment they do not want you there.It's not worth it.
good,"There are two types of people who work at Amazon; those who love it and those who hate it. Amazon is not for everyone and your experience there is mostly determined by your manager. It is a very exciting time to work at Amazon and lots of opportunity to make an impact on the business. You will surrounded by extremely smart who are passionate about what they do. The hours are long and hard and you will constantly be pushed. I learned so much (both personally and professionally) during my tenure at Amazon that will only benefit me in my future endeavors. Use Amazon to learn as much as possible. In the end, Amazon was not a fit for me personally, but I value every lesson I learned."
good,the jobs good if you haven't got a family to provide for. I really struggle with child care and I hardly get to see my children. when peak time comes its even worse as over time is compulsory which means less time at home with my children.
good,good first job for people coming out of high school. helps pay for school with good benefits. definitely wouldn't recommend for long term stability. overall good job.
good,Amazon is a fast paced work environment. Much contact and exposure to many people. Unique work place culture that isnt for everybody. Great benefits for employees.
good,"productive and competitive place to work, however the management is a little messed up. they don't follow their own rules before they terminate people."
good,"Amazon was a great place to work, I was apart of the reserves program, It was still kind of new and lacked a lot of guidess, Management was awful, inconsistent and only chatted with you if they got in trouble for not doing their jobs. honestly I'd go back if they would pay more attention to what is going on. When I say great I mean the customers yeah some are rude, but most of the time the people were very sweet, they made the job enjoyable."
good,Management doesn't care about your concerns. You get timed on how often you go to the restroom and if they think it's unnecessary you get wrote up for the smallest thing
good,"Managers seem not to have formal training. It appears that when an associate is promoted, they feel they no longer have to work. The lead by example method is not evident at all. It gives the appearance that the company would rather have attrition than to keep long term emp!oyees. This ius their way if not having to pay out stick options. Just not a friendly place to make you're career."
good,"Currently back at Amazon.com and being CSA (Customer Service Associate) for the U.K Retail and Ticketing dept, It's a great company to build a foundation on for customer services and care, to develop and learn on different tools within programmes on the computer. "
good,I have been with Amazon for almost 7 months and during that time i have grown a huge respect for the brand. The standard to deliver the very best to our customers is incomparable. The associates take the job seriously and do our very best to complete all scanning by the appropriate time. My body has been pushed to limits and at times the work load can be overwhelming. I do enjoy being fit and in shape.
good,"Customer obsession is the core focused principle which amazon follows. The best part about my current employer which I believe what sets apart is that it keeps the customer first and works everything else backwards. I.e. no matter what it takes just to satisfy the customer experience it doesn't care about the obstacles to achieve it, let it be to any possible heights."
good,Job was easy.  fast paced.  poorly run.  Hours are unstable.  One week you are asked to take time off.  The next week you had Mandatory overtime.  Would not recommend job.
good,Could be a very stressful job depending on the type of person you are. Every day was a hard productive day. The company tried their best to keep us motivated as we worked long hour shifts.
good,"Managers need to go at DTP1!"
good,"The job itself if very demanding. Although the pay and benefits are good, the work is hard and very tiring. Consider other options before working here. Most people are in and out within 3-4 months. Amazon makes you feel like you're replaceable."
good,Good place to wokr but only for those who can take the long hours and heat with little breaks. However the three to four days off compensate pretty well
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was the friends I made while working there. While my shift started at 7:30, I usually started at 6:30 to get my area set up for a smooth day."
good,"I want to say working at Amazon is great. In reality it stresses me out beyond intent. The long hours, and barely getting enough time to sit, it's always hot in there and there aren't any fans. It's a good place to work when you need benefits and paid time off. But you hardly get any time off."
good,The workers and leaders werent there for long because it was a new warehouse but for some reason all the leaders were egotistical... (some of them). Alot of workers didnt follow safety precautions and picking in some areas was impossible but you were tracked and had a quota so it was very hard.
good,"On paper, Amazon is a great company:  it has recognition, it's stock is on the ascent, it attracts talented individuals, and more."
good,"Management needs to work on a few things seems like they didnt know what they where doing "
good,"Often asked to game the numbers at the expense of pretty much everything. "
good,"Amazon isn't as terrible as people make it out to be. As long as you do what you're taught and keep up on your rate (100% everyday that you work), you'll be fine. The hardest part was standing up for long periods of time and your breaks barely last ten minutes, not giving you enough time to recuperate. The most enjoyable part is seeing what people are ordering from there; it feels like you're christmas shopping."
good,The quota you are required to meet is unrealistic on some days. The breaks are too short for the amount of labor you are producing. The pay should definitely be more.
good,"Amazon Fulfillment expects very high numbers for your productivity rate. There is minimal communication between departments' managers, resulting in conflicting interests between the departments that interact via inventory."
good,Good company to work.  Management realizes and listens to suggestions to improve efficiency to do your job better.  The best part of the job was the opportunity to work in different areas and get to know all of Amazon.
good,Packing or picking items for customer orders.  Management is constantly changing and is for the most part straight out of college.  People are friendly and very diverse.  The job itself is the hardest part.  The push for quantity or rate per hour sometimes seems to be the lager focus instead of the quality of the product and the service we provide.
good,"The work is fine at amazon. Perhaps it is a bit tiring, but overall its an okay place to work. I wouldn't mind working there again. The worst thing about working there is the long hours."
good,Amazon carries through with a great amount of sincerity to try and take care of its associates so that it can put itself apart from the rest of the shipping and insta-shop companies. It only fall short due to uncontrollable elements in the environment of the warehouses and the short comings and unprofessional conduct or attitude of the managers that sometimes climb up the ladder by faking a similar amount of caring. There are more genuine positive manager while still promoting the exceptional environment that amazon is aiming for. I would always suggest giving Amazon a shot. They are worth even a possible less then fantastic experience because they work hard and are still innovating for their workforce.
good,Work for Amazon in the warehouse. While in their emply we are not permitted to comment on what transpires within its walls on any and all social media sites.
good,"I liked working there a lot because it was easy to stay busy and time went by faster. Mostly everyone there was nice and easy to get along with. I think that you should be aloud to have 2 errors per 1,000 items."
good,L'ambiance de travail est agréable les tâches à accomplir ne sont pas compliqués les horaires sont bien ammenagés
good,for the majority of things it is a good place to work with good benifits and pay ... it isnt all of the management just some but mostly the hr team that need an attitude and rank check
good,"Zero work/life balance in my group. Other groups/departments seemed better. 'Suggested' overtime was commonplace, aka 60+ hours/week were expected although obviously could not be required."
good,they give so much of stress though if we r working too hard still they come to us for giving us bad review  and they never appricate for doing good work
good,"lavoro  tramite agenzia interinale ottimo ambiente lavorativo,organizzazione ottima,orari di lavoro su turni con possibilità di straordinari,richiesta disponibilità sabato e domenica,impossibiltà di passaggio a contratto indeterminato"
good,Best advice is to come to work an leave .be reliable dont call off a lot an you will never have an issue.learn all there is to know because once your out on the field your basically on your own
good,"they just lie to you every day telling you quality is a must, but when you don't meet the target you are in trouble. Same with health and safety regulation."
good,"Amazon is an awesome place to work if you don't mine working 10 to 11 hours a day 6 days a week. This job is not for everybody but, if you can handle it this job is what you need. The company is the highest paying local company with more that one location."
good,"Amazon has an extremely past paced environment where you often work more than 40 hours a week. Managers at Amazon are generally inexperienced and young. Work place culture is competitive and at times toxic. Managers are pressured to be better than their peers, there is little team work between shifts and within departments. Hardest part of the job is burn out for the long hours. Best part of the job the flexibility for time off"
good,There's nothing to do but sleep and then go to work for long vigorous hours with short breaks. The only thing they care about are your numbers. Also there is a lot of favoritism.
good,My time at Amazon had its ups and downs but I have no regrets. I would go back and I'm eligible to go back now if management would let me go back is another story. The management there is very poorly executed. No real source of leadership nor authority. There's too many cliques even among the management. Amazon is like a  second round at high school.
good,"I started out like every other employee in that I just scanned packages to pallets and moved pallets. After a couple of months I got moved to a position as an auditor. So  every day I have to check every pallet to make sure that it is built and wrapped in a way that will not fall or injure anyone. I have to check labels on pallets to make sure they match what is on the pallet. I have to make sure that each pallet is in the correct place for shipment ( meaning that that which should be going to Chicago does not end up going to Michigan). I also have to use a CPT screen and work with logistics to get the truck drivers out and en route on time. "
good,Amazon has great benefits. Hours are long and the floors take a toll on your body. Most enjoyable part of the job are your Coworkers; they are what makes this place fun but the management sucks. Hardest part of the job is working 10-12 hrs.
good,"the company ships things all over the country.  Amazon is even in India , that's great. I've been working there almost 6 months now and I'm still learning new things everyday."
good,"For the most part, the actual job is easy, but you are required to make rate. You'll have many opportunities to learn many jobs even though they all pay the same at tier 1 levels. Management could be better, but I'm pretty it varies from building to building. Hardest part of the job is basically just being on your feet for the whole shift, and sometimes you may have mandatory overtime. Most enjoyable part is the few benefits they offer like stock checks or around the holidays, you can win some good prizes"
good,"If you are looking for an easy job for some quick cash and don't plan on staying long this is the place for you. You can be the hardest worker there and management wouldn't even notice. Its not what you do, its who you know and what you do for them. In other words brown nosing."
good,"I liked Amazon a lot at first, but now I regret staying with them."
good,"A lot of good people left. It was like a revolving door.I constantly found myself training new people, and disciplining lazy co-workers. A very fast pace environment. Which required you to be on your feet the entirety of your shift."
good,a typical day at amazon is arrive to work at 7;30am proceed to stretches pack boxes lunch at 12;15 come back from lunch then its back standing on your feet until 6;00pm packing boxes or rebin work
good,"A typical day at Amazon starts off with stretching for about 5 mins twice a day, once at the start of shift and again after lunch. Working there you must have a thick skin and an even thicker mind. That company will do nothing but build you up just to happily see you fall flat on your face. The associates are even crueler and more vile than management can be. I was with the company for a good three years and let me tell you, the only positive I have is the consistent pay raises and the benefits. So if you like to make money but at the expense of your mental sanity and social life, Amazon is the perfect company for you."
good,"all managers are fresh out of college and have no idea how to run a warehouse. warehouses are extremely large wich means your 15 minute breaks arent actually 15 minutes but they are 5-10 minutes depending on where you are in the building. most managers will be on top of you if you are even 3 minutes late from break. the phrase ""work hard have fun make history"" is false. all you do is work hard. there is no such thing as having fun in this FC"
good,Good global company. Very data driven business. Very fast moving company in terms of decision making and actions. Very intelligent colleagues who are very helpful
good,"one big problem had  never saw a manger there   , its ok job  but  how the y treat   people could be better  but that just me  . i think they hire only for money to be honest sad i have to say that"
good,Amazon is a descent employer. Need to invest in their leadership team. Very long hours. Team are set up in silos. Limited advancement with the company.
good,"come in ,clock in, get your supplies, have a small stand up meeting, stretch in unison go to the section I work in find an aisle  create the bags in the system fill in any sections that missing bags go  to line to grab packages scan the code and take them to the correct location scan it keep doing that. management - ahh, culture - diverse hardest part the quotas. most enjoyable part going home."
good,"I have lot of sense to sell this type of things, bikes, cloths, mobiles, computers, etc i was sell this item to the buyers  i have experince to do work"
good,"I was working 4 10 hour days.  Working of 4 different floors with use of stairs only.  Very hard on your feet. Very tired, shift was from 6:00 pm to 4:30 am."
good,"Amazon will ask you to give your 110% into the job, little to no work life balance.  Management is typically good and makes the right choices but if you require work life balance this may not be the right company for you."
good,"The job is fairly simple and is a good place to work, unfortunately for myself there is no progression. Very hard to move up in business when university students get manager positions and team leads cannot move up to management level as they are all filled, disappointing."
good,"Some of the people that they have working in management do not belong there. They treat people unfairly and play favorites with their friends. The pay is wonderful and so are the benefits, but you have to put up with a lot of unfair treatment."
good,Pay was ok not the best. the people were interesting. You could be great at your job but you could get fired the next day. The management is bad they have no idea what there was doing.
good,"Although Amazon is a great company to work for, as far as benefits and perqs, considering my experience, the pay is modest and the opportunities for advancement are few and far between."
good,New Managers are rude & caused me to quit My job due to harassment in the Hawthorne location . But We Were frequently given Oppertutinty to voice opinion on things we were concerned about though things were NOT Changed in a timely manner . Great job for part time. Just not long term .
good,"This job is great for making money quickly, at an above-average wage. The work environment is difficult at times because people are always difficult. Management is focused on numbers only."
good,Just didn't like the people who worked there they made the work place very uncomfortable and hard to work in. The managers are never there when you need them and when they are there they are really rude and disrespectful.
good,"As long as you aren't a tier1 in a path function, the place is good. Management makes questionable decisions and decides to experiment a lot with things that don't make any sense with no explanation."
good,"Great Pay, You will work hard, Devices prone to errors thus you will have High Turn Over.  Work closely with HR. Watch for your UTO keep it high. No worries about PTO. And try to keep that Amazon Pace 2 steps per second"
good,"Amazon would be a great place to work if they had pay differences. starting pay is 12.00 an hour, I have been certified on 3-4 other jobs other then picking which I was hired to do and I still get paid 12.00 an hour. management has poor communication between them all and seem to never know exactly what is going on. Plus they change rules and way to do jobs every week. Turnover rate is super high."
good,"its a fast pace environment,but fun to work with,you will learn a lot from inbound to outbound process of the products.cant say uch of the management and co-workers coz i didnt work there that long.but all in all i still recommend them."
good,"In the year I have been with Amazon, I have grown and developed in my field. I have been give opportunities to lead senior leadership in several initiatives. Process improvement is a passion of mine and I have deep dived on several processes and have made more effective and efficient processes."
good,"Having to constantly try and get others to do their job."
good,"Been working here almost 2 years, the pay is decent, the work is not very hard, although it is demanding. Sure beats working out in the heat for less money, however management is everywhere, not everyone is on the same page, lots of micro managing going on, i cant stand the fact that my job can change in the drop of a pin. ""Company needs"" is what they tell you, however, they only look at numbers on the computer screen, anything you do to go above or beyond, goes unnoticed and you will not be rewarded, as long as you are not the bottom percent, you have no fear of being fired, place is overall just a joke, and i am obviously on here looking for another job, lol. Not a bad place to work short term while looking for another job, that is for sure."
good,"Safety, it’s more than wearing a reflective vest. We’re committed to providing one of the safest work environments, which means stretching, safety tips, and yes…following the rules."
good,"Amazon is a great career when they are busy, but when there isn't much more you wont get the hours your were initially hired for. The break were not long enough because of all the walking you have to do just to clock out."
good,the job is good paid but the management is very poor.the manager picks a side instead of being fair to all the employees.good benefit and good schedule .overal is an okay job
good,job was only temp during holidays.  lots of work during the holidays.  felt like I lived there always had overtime.  people were very friendly and work place was pleasant.
good,"Performance is the beginning and end to any day at Amazon. If you cannot preform your life will become very difficult. Management will only notice you if you do not meet expectations, don't expect any real relationship to be created desired. The culture is the same, it exist to promote performance, nothing more, and it leads to high turnover."
good,As a company as a whole it's great but when you break down the interworking is when it starts to fail. They do take good care of their employees as a whole but on a one on one it's who you know and how well the like you.
good,"Comfortable Company with Good benefits in place. Plenty overtime allows for decent pay. Terrible management, continuous rearrangement leads to disarray."
good,A typical day at work was a great environment full of humor and hardworking people who was more than willing to give tipsm advicem and help to one another to get the job done.
good,"It was always hot, we had very short breaks , sometimes we didn't get a break at all , some of the boxes were to heavy. they did care about safety a lot ."
good,"Different schedules available."
good,I worked at the last stage before the boxes would leave the facility. I like working there time would fly by. I loved that I was up moving. when I walked into work I didn't know what I would have been doing that day from loading truck to working in transship it kept it interesting. the down side of amazon is that if your were not friends with the managers there it was really hard to move up and not only that but the positions do not become open often. My most favorite part of the job was when I got to get training on a forklift I love when they would schedule me to drive it. I had to leave that job because I hurt my back loading the trucks and I used all of my paid  time off dealing with that and they let me go.
good,"it started out fun. really enjoyed it, then they started to push needing numbers did not care if you were hurting hot  ect..  did not matter that we all had lives out side.  they have us working overtime.  some managers are wonderful and then there are some.."
good,Company is really good but Management is worst. Its really bad in terms of promoting worthy employees because of the management who don't actually look what an employee is actually doing to get next position
good,I feel like they should help you with Nrr more.  They just put you out there and when you mess up they call you out .  No permanent positions. Seasonal only
good,over worked in harsh conditions a lot of unfairness in the workplace there's so many people working there that it's hard to get any help most of the time
good,"Good  job but sometimes the production rates are very high."
good,"Great coworkers, but you will have no work life balance and the princesses you receive of angry customers as well as the constant nagging you receive regarding metrics will leave you self esteem in shambles. Working for Amazon is detrimental to ones mental health and is much like being in an abusive relationship. They always make you feel that you are doing something wrong, they monitor everything you do, and they have a knack for making it seem like you can never leave, while guilt tripping and often forcing you to work overtime weather you would like to or not. As mentioned, the coworkers are great. But upper management is a joke that only cares about numbers and will dispose of you like you are nothing. (I quit, I wasn't fired by the way). They have nice benefits, nice potlucks, and great opportunities to move up and travel the world, however."
good,"The job is okay as a last resort, but from my experience, there is not a lot of room for advancement and it's incredibly repitiious. Would not recommend."
good,"Emploi instable. Trop de pression, nous sommes des robots."
good,"Best place to work when I started in 2010, I used to love going to work. The job wasn't so bad and managers did their best to make it a fun environment, we used to get rewarded often with pizza days, sweaters, movie tickets, etc. Forward to 2017 worst place to be it has become very unstable barely have enough work for all their employees and hold them accountable if they don't make rate. Management SUCKS, don't treat their employees with respect and talk down to them. The only ones who would say they like it are the ones that are always sucking up to the managers, if that's you, you'll love it."
good,Not much to say. It is like any other walmart. Paying you very little and expecting you to do a lot. I worked overnight as a stocker. I got a dollar extra but 5 dollars worth of more work
good,"This job is under an NDA so I can't speak to the actual position, but I will say the team is big and easy to get lost in. Not very much opportunity to move up within this team."
good,a typical day at work was parking your car and walking to clock in and going to your pit machine and getting ready for work. i learned patience. management had an negative attitude all the time. the people were sociable. the hardest part of the job was to find parking. the most enjoyable part of the job honestly was going home.
good,I have worked here for 1 year & based on this experience here are my Pros & Cons about the company. You have a lot of things to learn but the systems here are not well organized.
good,"Correre avanti, indietro, destra, sinistra tra gli scaffali.."
good,"They try to Over work you for the pay they give is not worth it, if you know more than one job and are a ASSET that doesnt get taking into consideration! nor does your pay rate go up. you could do more than your AM ( Area Managers)  and still get paid same as the person who does little to no work! little to No appreciation"
good,"This warehouse is actually very professional and has gotten better over time, but they have lacked a lot of investment and innovation from their bottom line and the passion most of their associates can contribute to the work."
good,I liked working for amazon but the management was poor they did not show any care for the employees. The pace of work was to over whelming and required too much. I wish I had another position over all.
good,The work culture of Amazon is very good. Employees are taken care of and benefits are good. The productivity and quality standards are high and is a good place to launch your career.
good,Must know the job description you are getting into. If working in a newly opened warehouse there is room for growth within fairly quick. Advancement is certainly favorites.
good,"You can and will def grow, however if you know the right people you'll grow within the workplace. Managers Intimidated by people that work under them and get rid of them if they feel so."
good,"The best part about the work is that 40 hours a week is guaranteed, and you can do it from the comfort of your home. However, the time constraints of what is expected as you are on Amazon's time is definitely an inconvenience to workers. Training is self-taught or given by whoever feels compelled to help; but don't count on it too much. Management, for the most part, handles their duties from home as well; there's no telling the kind of rapport going on between management and employees. I don't have the energy to continue spelling out how their standard of customer service is a contradiction to any other's standards."
good,its a great company to work for if you don't mind transfers every 3months. met a lot of people working for amazon and also built some great life long relationships.
good,"Was a fun company to work. Leadership was mostly friendly. Great break area. Work wasn't difficult. Met a lot of great friends/co-workers."
good,Fun environment because of fellow peer associates. Good benefits when you start work. Bad work environment due to upper management not controlling day to day incoming and outgoing volumes correctly (some days it seems like they don't have a clue on what's going on at all).  The hardest part of the job would have to be having to stand in one spot for ten hours doing monotonous repetitive work with just two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch and that is still the same as when required to work an 11 hour shift.
good,"Bar Raiser program is great idea with poor execution.  The company is run via great data analytics, but, it's hiring via the Bar Raiser Program has become highly subjective."
good,"Amazon for me was a fast paced job, not hard, and good daily work out. Usually i would just be at a desk with a conveor belt in front, and basically u pick wich item u wanted to pack, complete the packing process and make sure its in the system and let the belt take it. There was also a rate you had to have by the end of the day, as long as u keep moving and have a technique then rate wasn't a problem. Hardest part of the job would be getting a big order to pack that was heavy or didnt fit in the box ect. Could have used a management change though."
good,"Several groups different parts of the bldg. doing stretches and receiving different information. some got right information, others wrong. Moved around a lot."
good,"You have to have the ability to work successfully in stressful situations. Working varying shifts including holidays, and weekends."
good,"Long hours, but the culture of the place is very nice. Management seems to respond better to buzzwords than job performance."
good,"Its not a bad place to work for only a short period of time. Constantly active and moving around, I loved to people I worked with but the leadership and managers could have been better"
good,its amazon pretty decent off peak time cool people basic work peak is rough but the pay is good very adamant about time off task they really clock you
good,"The job itself is not hard to learn or difficult. The ""hard part"" as a picker is having to keep up with the very demanding quota the company tries to uphold."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work, if you're not directly dealing with the customers. As the company is an International one and delivers world-class service, it has made some of its customers too accustomed to privileges and perks that they have become indolent. "
good,"I have learned a lot from my coworkers, The work force is awesome and you can learn a lot from all of the various workers that are there. The job it self is easy but the lack of mental stimulation makes it harder."
good,luogo di lavoro impeccabile ma totale mancanza di sicurezze per il futuro essendo principalmente indirizzata all'impiego di manodopera a tempo determinato.
good,"The work day was 10 hours long although the work week only has 4 days, very packed work in the day and keeps getting more demanding. Amazon as a company always tries to keep you motivated with rewards but the management sometimes fails to do the same."
good,"The workplace and culture are definitely cool but, salaries are just plain okay. Sales customer associate have the hardest job, if you are not in a least bit interested in it"
good,"The can be hard oin your body. The pay is OK. They should pay a little more for the type of work you do there. The have great gifts games and prizes."
good,"Working at amazon is very stressful mentally and physically. You are harshly graded on your productivity and forced to meet their unreasonable standards. You have very little off days for holidays. the only holiday that we are off for is Christmas day. Management is crossed, restrictive and shows an immense amount of favoritism. The only upside to working here is that they have a set schedule and it is a good backup plan because they do hire everyone. It is not difficult at all to get a job here and they pay a good amount to not have any credentials but there is a reason why because they will work you like a slave no doubt."
good,"Management all college graduates young and clueless to what their doing. Hr dept are friends with management so you cant talk to them either.AM write you up and you don""t even know you have a write up until its almost a final then your fired.The pay is good but taps out after 1.50 in 3 years ,This job is for young kids not a career also they VTO so you can leave because of no work on the lines.Amazon will always have a high turnover but if you can stand on your feet for 10 hours the work is easy.Also your held accountable for quality mistakes on day 1 so you usually have a write up the 2nd week because of the mistakes you made doing learning the job."
good,"Arriver a 5h30 rangement des affaire ."
good,Extremely LONG hours... may be required to work up to 11 hours depending on the time of the year. They pay well but the job will consume your life. Is a good place to work if you want to work temporary.
good,I recently worked and Amazon. The working environment was very large and fun. The co workers were awesome. The extra gifts u received during the holiday were a nice thing too.
good,"Learnt a lot as was my first job. Job was very hard but enabled me to try my hardest and succeed in new things."
good,This warehouse setting has been one of my worst work experiences. Managers were unprofessional. HR did not have their proper work settings. People were not treated properly as far as being excused from work. The LOA team has always been a waste of time and is an unecessary extention to the company. Security needs to be held more responsible for protecting the building aswell as personal vehicles and beelongings. I dont understand how cars along side the buildings windows in front of a security window can be broken into and not get noticed by security as alarms are flashing in front of the guards.
good,"Long hours, no benefits. Only thing good was the pay. I only recommend this job to somebody if you really need money but not for a career."
good,"good standard of training for work "
good,"Worked here during summer break. The first 3 weeks is fine, but the work takes a toll on your back. I worked here for 6 weeks. The job was easy."
good,"Amazon is an amazing company to work for - but is better for those 3-5 years in their career. The university programs need more development, and this is not a company that promotes growth for entry-level employees. Management is great for some teams, but definitely needs more comprehensive development for others. Managers need more training in general, for as quickly as new employees are being on-boarded. The atmosphere of many teams are like a start-up culture, and it is a ""horizontal"" culture, meaning there are no barriers in communication between you and your superiors. Amazon is moving rapidly, with the latest technology on the market. Their competitors are trying to keep up. They are innovative, and it is a great place to leverage yourself and work harder than you've ever worked before. But if you are not ready to put your head down and sacrifice to make your work a large part of your life, this may not be the company for you."
good,"Nothing overly-special about the environment. Production-fueled work atmosphere where good numbers matter more than anything. Sometimes there is an appearance of effort towards associate satisfaction, but for the most part the people who work there complain about silly things and most managers have gotten jaded."
good,great job! but... management its horrible. Why ? They hire none experience 4 year degree people who are willing to sign a contract.
good,"What I enjoyed most about this job was the benefits and not being monitored all the time when out on deliveries. You basically run on your own time, but still have to get done with your route at a fair pace. The hardest part was making sure packages don't get stolen when they're out of your hands after the package was delivered. A typical day I would start early, hop in a assigned Amazon truck with my route attached to my scanner, load my truck at the warehouse and afterwards, head to my destination and proceed with my route. Usually, I used to finish within 7-8 hours then I'd get to go home. The one thing I learned with this job is to have patience, because most times, you'd be in a rush to go home, but this job made me realize to be patient and calm and everything usually goes smoothly."
good,"This is basically High School all over again folks. You work around 10+45 people at any given time with the age range of 18-25 year olds predominately there so keep your head down at first, know who to talk to and who to stay away from. Managers are a joke, if you work and don't talk a whole lot you'll blend in and be okay. Only the Sort Warehouses in my opinion are worth working at. Those ones won't fire you because you didn't hit the expected rate, although they do check for that. Sort Warehouses are only part time though, and if you want full time there you'll have to have some kind of degree. Some people use this job as if it was eHarmony. Don't get caught up. Don't get played. This is good first job, just be street smart."
good,good place to work good place to work but they weren't organized and that's something I really don't like but they did have good food and a nice size cafeteria
good,"Depending on department, job can be easy and boring, or challenging and frustrating. Everyone get use to the long employee tours, the security clearance, and the short breaks. I've learned many warehousing areas, educational programs, and how to maintain myself during the 10 hours on the clock."
good,Management did not utilized the talents and skills of it Associates. Associates with experience and education were passed over for associates who were more favored rather then qualified.
good,"A typical day at Amazon usually consist of trying to force yourself to keep going for another ten hours. I learned how to drive PIT which is a great skill to have but other than that, I honestly don't have any more positive things to say. Management as a whole are an OK bunch but when you get to the Area Managers that's where the slippery slope starts. You can either get a really awesome I'm going to teach you everything you need to be a better person or your going to get ""I'm only going to spend my time with these select few and help them on their path to success."" The hardest part of this job is that I graduated high school a couple of years ago but it honestly feels like I'm back, especially with all the THOTS walking around and all the men who like to complain and rat on everything and everyone, but in all honesty the most enjoyable part was leaving everyday. The ten hour work days are excruciating but the three-day weekends were worth it. I do not recommend Amazon as a company to work for unless you are a brown noser."
good,"Amazon is an interesting place to work depending on where you are placed. In CVG3 it just seems that the AM's (Area Managers) don't really care for their associates as much as they say. When the PA's (Process Associate/Supervisor) is having troubles the AM's just get mad at them because they aren't making the ""numbers"" they should be."
good,"I was forced to move to another team the first 4 hours joining the company following a 4 round ""team match"".  Marketplace team have no ambition towards technologies. Heavily driven by business. "
good,"I believe that if they took control of bad situations that they would be able to have a lower turn over rate. In a typical day they would make you go over the same thing over and over and it was incredibly tedious. I felt that if they put people in certain jobs and considered their abilities and put them in functions that would work better for them, they would have a better work atmosphere."
good,Not particularly hard to work lots of chances for overtime but not much in trying to get up in the ranks of management. You will always know what you are doing day in and day out. It is not a bad thing for some but it can make your work life feel empty.
good,"It is a pretty simple job and goes by quick. Since employees are not interviewed and only have to pass an assessment to get hired, you are working with people that have no care for the next person. Very rude staff, managers don't care much about employees. Constantly moving during the entire shift is a nice work out."
good,"It is a great atmosphere, just when it comes to working the higher management likes to push work down that managers have no time to get completed. Instead of staying and helping, they leave early and never answer the phone in situations. Love the place, would love to move up through the company, but unfortunately my morale with them has went down and I would like to move on."
good,"In such an advanced workplace with robots and machines producing outstanding results, the human error margin is very small and will not be tolerated.  In my full-time leadership position, not labeled as a ""Manager,"" I was exposed to many people from all walks of life and my daily task was to rally my team of over 50 associates, sometimes over 120 during Peak Season, and ensure that they were working as one team and achieving the daily output goal set by a computer."
good,Benefits were good but did not look at your strong points or your concerns very unsafe place to work and very unclean. There were rates the same rates for everyone so 50 year old were compared to 20 year old ...not fair
good,Although this had brilliant pay there was just enough breaks and the hours that you have to do when working here are just out of control the hardest part of this job is the time limit you are set to get everything done
good,"The facilities maintenance has six shift schedules ten hour shifts working 24/7 days.The company has Picnics every year, and turkey dinners every year."
good,"does not give you long enough breaks. management sucks, they don't care about their employees. Amazon has okay pay but fantastic benefits. That is the only reason I stayed"
good,Easy going job. Management sucks. You just go to get paid that's it. They over work you during peak season but then write you up for the littlest of all reasons after December.
good,best part was meeting new people. your numbers were never good enough they wanted more always played mind games. never had time to take appropriate breaks.
good,"I only worked one season as amazon's picker and the first few nights were actually quite fun. I enjoyed the somewhat friendly environment between shifts. We're required to do stretching exercises before starting our 12+ hour shifts. The pay is very nice, but that's about it for PROs. You're assigned two 15 minute breaks every 4 hours of constant moving around and you're spending most of that just walking back to the break room from your post. To make matters worse if you are even one second late, you're instantly written up before crossing through the security line. Though you get paid for those 15 minute ""breaks"", you only get a 30 minute lunch unpaid and with the insane work load you're putting yourself though, that's hardly enough time to refresh before finishing the rest of your shift. Myself and many others complained about this to the management and none of cared at all. Their job is basically to stand/sit around for the entire time hounding at others for either not being fast enough or not at all. They just don't get it. I believe in hard work, but there's only so much a person can do running on 5 to 7 hours of sleep. Employees at Walmart get treated better than this!"
good,"I was able to further my customer service skills, but did not like to stay in one spot for the duration of my shift."
good,"I didn't like the management, wasn't good or well put together . need some structure. but I did like the typical work day, gives you chances too learn other machines and some opportunity."
good,I only worked there on a temporary basis but I was not very impressed with their staff treatment.Not very well organised. Disappointing lunch breaks (Half an hour lunch break over a 12 hour shift and only 2 x 15min. breaks
good,"Morning briefing at seven thirty and then ten hours of constant hard work with periodic cajoling to work even harder. Learned how a large scale semi-automated facility is run and how a multi-cultural workforce can co-exist effectively. Less that impressed by some of the management who lacked meaningful experience and occasionally appeared out of their depth and unwilling or unable to make decisions which might challenge the status quo. Kaizen was poorly implemented. Fantastic bunch of co-workers though, friendly and most often helpful.  The hardest part of the job for a lowly Fulfillment Associate is undoubtedly its sheer physicality. Every day is like ten hours of aerobics - at the end of a week you will usually be dead on your feet (but the four day week and three day weekend helps with recovery)."
good,"If you're looking for decent pay and benefits, Amazon is for you! Be prepared for long shifts on your feet, and constant criticism. Not too accomodating in regards to abilities (too short, can't reach, even with step ladders). Favoritism is huge; most upper level management and HR will nod and smile, but not listen. It's a numbers game, and unfortunately, you are a number, too. Overtime is called at a moment's notice, so forget that time with your family/friends you had planned. "
good,"I first started working for this company though a temp service when they opened a new warehouse in Indiana but got laid off because it was a seasonal position. I came back a year later through that same temp and got hired as a Amazonian. two years and 9 months there has done good for me. we got a dollar raise, got to cash/invest in stocks, great and affordable insurance for me and my family,college reimbursement and great pay. the downside (for me) was the work. Its easy if your doing a simple task that has a rate but it can be hard work and your are often trained (without a pay increase) in other roles and expected to do three or four things at once. Multitasking is an understatement. Growth in the company often feels impossible. Seniority has nothing to do with moving up the corporate chain  which is good if when you work hard. On the other hand it seems that you have to ""know a guy"" in order to move up. Right now (in my opinion) some of the management team are not listening to what the employees have to say about what goes on in the company/or department, or when they do, it isn't taking as seriously as hoped for. There is clearly a lot of favoritism taking place as well as taking advantage of hard workers at the expense of their health. Overall, The pay, and Benefits are worth the stay. Sometimes the hours, which is typically 10hrs a day, four days a week with possible  mandatory or voluntary over time(an extra 10hrs=time and a half) Its peak season will definitely test your patience and will power to work 60+ a week for the holidays. But more money making opportunity is"
good,The management at amazon was not very good at all. It was like working in a sweatshop. Amazon doesn't care about it's employees.
good,"Team members Over worked "
good,"A typical day at Amazon is very fast paced. Be ready to get straight to work as soon as you walk into the building. I was able to learn many things working here from building great team working skills to even building personal analytical skills. The management from my experience try to create a flexible and evolving environment in setting the goal to accommodate every employee at Amazon. Working at Amazon will enlighten you with some of the coolest co-workers you will ever have. The hardest barrier you will experience working at Amazon is the great amount of walking you will do each day. If you are in the Picking Department, as I was, you will walk at least 10-15 miles per day. The most enjoyable thing about working at Amazon was the opportunity to make extra money. Amazon almost always offers overtime every week, allowing its employees to rack up on extra earnings."
good,very diverse workplace they embrace people with military experience. The potential to move up is more from an outside applicant then an inside associate
good,"You would come in and do the same routine and everything was based of a production rate, that determinant how much work you accomplished that day."
good,Everyday is a challenge and there's lots of standing and walking. The people that I work with are very approachable and willing to work with you. We work hard and play hard because Amazon expects results!
good,"Typical work at amazon is good have learned lot of things to do there "
good,"Changes rate value to get rid of more people. They did not want me to progress to a different department. They do not care about the workers. As long as the work is done, our feelings and opinion is irrelevant."
good,"PA ordering and departing pick ups on a daily basis insuring departures on time, insure rate is at standards  amazon not always take to account of situations on hand. Not fair. managers often favor associates for advancement or exception position assignments."
good,"Warehouse full of somewhat motivated young workers.  "
good,I don't recommend working here they only care about numbers there is really no connection to the associates. They monitor you like a number. They look down on you if your not making your rate and will fire you because of it.
good,this job offered many hours and over time which lead to a good pay check. the hardest part of this job was that is was 10 hours a day and you didn't get much time on your breaks.
good,"Management at PREVIOUS location is kind of poor. Stowing grew very tiresome. Not sure if there is room to grow here. A lot of MANAGERS quit. Overall, benefits and pay are great. "
good,"Amazon est une unités commercial virtuel leader sur le marché du E-commerce"
good,"A typical work day is long and you are constantly on your feet. Having to work in such a fast paced environment is hard, but when you do well and meet your productivity targets it can feel very rewarding. "
good,"Stower :"
good,"A lot of favortism! Hard to grow with company! Horrible pay for warehouse work! Easy work, but at times can become overwelming."
good,"its a good place to work if you are a hard worker like myself, but there i long hours and very short breaks and lunch. so yeah thats my review to all you people hope you happy anyways"
good,"it was a12 hour shift "
good,I liked working at amazon because it was fast past and made my day go by fast. I didnt like the fact that they didnt have alot of work at times and would send people home early a couple times out of the week.
good,"Pay is great, hours are rotating nights and days.  Tough to be a manager here.  Overall atmosphere is a good to be around.  Good start for anyone looking to transition from the military or college."
good,They are very strict with safety and productivity. you are expected to meet their rates which is hard to reach in your first few weeks. Then after a few weeks your body gets used to it.
good,"It was a good fun job fast pace i learned teamwork , and i got a lot from that job.the hardest part of my job was leaving cause when you start to work you be having so much fun the time just goes passed."
good,"Prepare to learn multiple tasks in work environment. Managers like to switch employees around to perform multiple tasks. Four long 10 hour night shifts. Be prepared to do a lot of walking and physical labor. A job like this teaches you to manage sleep schedule, work at fast pace, since every task is a rated function, and also performing various labor tasks. The best part about the job is the co-workers. Everyone is very friendly. Management is very inconsistent. Expect to learn multiple tasks and perform them well because every task is rated. The hardest part of the job is maintaining rate everyday, especially in a task that you may not perform very well."
good,"This job is very fast pace , working alone to meet goals and deadlines. With a little help from fellow employees you can barely get through the night or day."
good,"Its a pretty easy going job, but not much room for advancement. Also management isn't as involved as they should be. But overall its a nice place to work if your just looking for a part time job."
good,"A typical day at work usually started around 8 am and the higher ups would tell us about the quota needed for the day. Management were okay, however they set seemingly impossible quotas and never really cared to know more about the workers. It felt like we were mostly random cogs of a well-run machine."
good,"The work is monotonous, HR is horrific and management is hit or miss. They have good benefits, way better than most. The 10 hour days are good but bad since you have to spend most of your off days running errands."
good,the staff at Amazon were friendly made some good contacts working there was easy to learn the job quiclky only problem was wearing those steel toed boots
good,Good pay and benefits but takes too much time away from normal life/routine and honestly not worth it. There is also a lot of favoritism within the manager and the associates.
good,"Relativement libre, on a une production à faire et on nous forme à une méthodologie, mais on reste indépendant, les managers ne sont pas sur notre dos. L'intégration au sein de l'équipe se fait assez facilement dans la mesure où les nouveaux arrivants sont nombreux."
good,"This company tends to lead the associates on. There is no job security, however i love my Position with the company. I wish there was more leadership that will not leave you in the dark about where you stand. Good company to work for but not Great"
good,By the company hiring so may people it's a fun and easy way to learning about different cultures. Also I've learned how to manage my time do to the long work hours and days.
good,"I would say Amazon is a good place to work if this is your first warehouse job. They train you pretty well from the get-go but if you don't want to work long hours, or do a lot of physical work, you will not last very long. I would say if you work hard and just follow the rules you should be fine."
good,"I loved working with logistics. While working with amazon, I've learned leadership skills, the operations of running a giant facility and how operations worked. Management was inconsistent and ver unorganized. Due to harsh circumstances of inexperienced fresh graduates running the facility, nit picking onto experienced workers and siding with others condemning and pointing out faults of others and ignoring what was wrong. But the people that worked there was the best part. Everyone was friendly and worth coming into to work."
good,the building in all was a good place to work. there management team just made you not want to come back to work. but i feel that the workers are very caring and make you happy to be there
good,Required to lift heavy boxes and need to reach the expectations..You need to have a strong physical body because the job is physically tough
good,"it's a very hard place to advance at and the pay is terrible."
good,"Not a challenging or motivating work place."
good,My co workers at amazon wear great and friendly just like most of the management. The work was never to much or overwhelming because the workplace itself was very organized and everything seemed to run smoothly.
good,"Long nights at work, fast speed required. The management at most times would be left in the dark until the last minute, creating issues. The working conditions are adiquate, but injuries can be an issue. The on site medical team could do nothing more than but on a bandage or ice you."
good,Doesn't pay enough for labor. We walked a lot and our breaks weren't long enough .Just a bad experience there overall. If I could go back I would have worked In another department.
good,its very hard work u have fun at the same time it was a good place to work at. we did alot we work hard the people are friendly the days go by fast i enjoy working at amazon
good,I left because economically there wasn't a financial future.  I was a tipped employee with my base rate of pay at 7.40 per hour. It just wasn't enough to live off realistically and the environment was more and more depressing in my opinion.
good,Les chefs mettent énormément de pression et demande souvent l'impossible
good,a great company to work for if the training was organized and not rushed. if you dont have means  of transportation good place to work
good,Great place to work if you have a second job or if you are a college student. Schedules can be negotiated only for college students.The job can be very productive and heavy in selective areas.
good,"I do enjoy the work at amazon, the management is very helpful and encouraging, but the work hours are too long, and there is a long amount of standing. "
good,"Amazon is all about the numbers and their own growth, not so much about the employees. there is no balance in work/family life. The company makes you feel as if your work is not valued and experience is not a factor in advancing, its based on how much management likes you. The culture seems aimed more at children or someone who has never had a job before."
good,The 10 hour shifts with large amounts of madatory overtime do not cover for the minimum wage pay provided. The management was handled poorly because they can barely keep us motivated. Alot of workers want to leave home all the time and when they do offer us voluntary time off the give us a slap in the face by cancelling it after everyone who needed it signed up.
good,Working at Amazon distribution was enjoyable and I learned about everything to do with order picking there. The only problem was that it was only a temporary position
good,Manage between 50-150 workers to meet critical pull times to ensure packages make it to customers on time. One of the first company to listen and take ideas from employees and put to into standard work.
good,The most busiest and hypocritical company and management I have ever met. Its great being a customer there but not an employee.
good,Everything is so new so if you are looking for structure I wouldn't recommend. Average tenure is less than a year so high turnover.
good,very challenging job. I was the last one standing in the group I was hired with. they all sacked them. and I had back pain from over carrying heavy things. even though I do it as instructed
good,Everything is great . but with great comes very hard work and tons of reason to get wrote up . you never really feel like your job is safe.
good,had to reach numbers everyday and had to do a certain amount of returns. the job had its ups and downs they had contest for  holidays . it was some what easy going but very straight to the point
good,Mangers promised alot and never came threw for us. we couldnt move up because in there eyes its not how hard you work its who you know.
good,Amazon puts to much on there employees.  I took 4 different ou's calls and i was only trained to take calls in 2 of them. and when you get a negative response on something you no nothing about sucks
good,"I'm a current employee working at the fulfillment center on Broening highway. I loved the job when i first started and now i hate the place.... Plain and simple numbers, numbers, numbers!!!!! You are constantly talked to about your numbers by leadership when you're not meeting rate expectations. You could lose your job for a lack of productivity!!!!! It becomes overwhelming when you're doing your very best but are constantly being told basically your best isn't good enough and to pick up your pace! You can't have bad days at Amazon!!!! You must come to work energized as if you've had gallons of coffee to meet their unreasonable rate expectations or leadership will nitpick you to death about it. I don't like all the forced overtime either, it's exhausting. Let me not forget to mention that the environment is crude and vulgar. Employees have been caught having relations in the bathrooms, empty four loko cans and royal farms chicken boxes thrown on the premises,  loud rap music blasting from cars in the parking lot etc. The only thing good about working at Amazon is the pay, it's just not the job nor environment for me!!!!! To each his or her own!!!!"
good,"long hot hours, decent pay, management is very unorganized, very little room for growth, the buildings is way over crowded company does cool things around Christmas time."
good,Can be a tough place to work. You will do a lot of walking. Between 8-20 miles in a 10 hour shift depending on the department you are in. The benefits and time off are pretty good but you will find that you don't always work with motivated people and you have to look out for your own best interest as sometimes people work harder at making you look bad than doing their own job.
good,"working at amazon is tough, started in November 2014 and was paid off in july and worked in 3 departments, worked through an agency, there is so much pressure to do things write and hit tagets and no get any errors also a point system where if  your a minute late you bet appoint, sent home sick you get a point, they have no care about health issues which I know myself personally as I had a panic attack in a department and was put on a heart monitor and was not moved departments and hurt my shoulder because of heavy lifting and now im on medication because of this, they have no consideration and it stresses you out."
good,"Decent money, long hours, hard work, very repetitive and boring. Lack of energy in the company, they seem to care about each other though at work unless you get injured they will just tell you to go back to work. very strict on vacation and being late."
good,"A typical day involves nothing but work.  After the morning huddle, from then on, it is work until your 12 hour shift is over with.  Little room for lunchbreaks and breaks"
good,"They are not flexible on hours. You have to pay for your own lunch, the breaks are really short especially when you try to get to the break area from the 3rd floor on the other side of where it is."
good,it was not a great place to work because of the hours and we were barely told anything and was all was always getting annoyed every hour about to do more when there was no more.
good,"strict guidelines on work production, very strenuous on your body. you will leave in pain. plenty of opportunity for overtime"
good,"This is a retail company, very fast paced and very demanding job. The typical day is wide open from start to finish. Management needs alot of work. The best part is the people i have met and work with every night you get to know them and hear about there families and there lives."
good,"Time taken from breaks for walking, surprise mandatory overtime, lots of pressure to meet specific goals to retain job, regular raises but advancement is by application and interview process only, not very many advancement opportunities"
good,"Arrivée le matin, attribution des postes de travail.Mise en place et ouvertures des cartons sur la chaine. "
good,"Very long hard enduring hours, not really enjoyable, somewhat moderately easy yet very tough due to length and temperature."
good,Learned about time management and different technology used to track shipping of goods and accurately confirming orders
good,"taking boxes off the line, using a package to package scanning method to ensure a quality product. safety driven warehouse"
good,I just started some managers are okay (Thur/Fri/Sat) Sunday managers are excellent. This is demanding physical work. My body is exhausted. I'm exhausted mentally and physically. Short short breaks. Very strict . Decent pay
good,"I worked three days a week telecommuting for the virtual contact center.  There was constant pressure to get a ""yes"" click on a follow up email to the customer, even if you resolved their issue, but they were not accepting of the outcome. Any more than three ""no"" clicks a week put you over goal. Team culture was supportive and great. Team managers are the hardest working people there."
good,"- Versteckte Time Checker, um zu sehen, ob man vor Gongschlag in   die Pause geht."
good,I loved working at APS the people there are great people. The work wasn't too hard and there was always something new to do. The only draw back was the pay and sometimes you would not get but 29 hours a week.
good,"once you come in , you do stretches . always good because you don't strain yourself, in work. I learned how to prepp and pack items . management, wasn't a big fan of considering, they were everywhere. sometimes doing nothing . the co-workers, were ok . the hardest part of the job was, having to always have a good to above rate. in a rated function if you didn't you were basically written up. didn't enjoy it at most times, it payed the bills."
good,Everyday at work was not the same being able to make and maintain the required rate for the day was not impossible but it wasn't easy. My coworkers were enjoyable people to work with.
good,"Been their for 6 yrs ready to move on if the money is right. Pick,stow,lifting and walking and standing. I am very flexible and I also enjoy getting to know the people around me; it's like a family atmosphere. I feel the time is right to move on to something new and express my talents."
good,"There was no any typical day"
good,Its a fun place to work... Pay is very low and the job is not hard but long hours on your feet. You can listen to music. A chance to move up to team lead is offered
good,N/A Still employed Has excellent benefits Hours are great..have 3 days off 10 hour shifts make it good for family time and has an excellent leave accommodations team
good,Easy job but too many technicians for the amount of work provided. They did not promote team environment. There was a buddy system in place and that is how they promoted. There were a lot of techs that where more experienced but did not get promoted.
good,"Exceptional communication and organizational skills, with a great attitude and work ethic and proven customer service"
good,"Long hours, good pay, just have to stay motivated and maintain proper work safety and procedures. make sure you are on time coming back from breaks, watch your points and know how many hours of leave you have accumulated"
good,Working in receiving cut open boxes scan items and the place them virtually and physically on other carts to be stowed away.
good,"One will learn on how to email well and deal with different customers, get to know their though process through emails. One can have good time working."
good,management is constantly changing making it the blind leading the blind and so any  time you make a suggestion to fix the process it would hit a wall because management would not know who to communicate with to implement this change
good,"its a pretty manageable job starting out. They are usually good about showing you different aspects of the job. But long term they do not want you to stick around. Change is buzzword at Amazon. While i agree that striving for better is good, they take it too far. Starting at the bottom means you aren't likely to break into management, as they prefer to pull in raw college grads with no work experience rather than promote from within."
good,"I liked being able to learn new processes, but the physical labor and poor management is pushing me away.  I enjoy the people, but I don't prefer the company policies."
good,"I started working for Amazon.com's fulfillment center in July 2014. A typical day at work involves a lot if scanning and building pallets. While those are the two main job functions, there are other areas you may work in. I have cross trained in just about every job function. I have also trained new associates for our peak season. This facility is new (opened July 14, 2014), so there are glitches. I expected more room for advancement and more hours, but it's not possible unless you are willing to transfer. The management is pretty cool, you just have to interact with them. I love my co workers and benefits. I also love being an Ambassador (trainer). I found what I loved doing the most when I became an Ambassador. These things are the most enjoyable part of this job to me. The dislikes are the breaks 15 minutes (10 for break and 5 for walking back and forth to floor. It should be 20 minutes 15 for break and 5 for walking). 30 minute lunches when you work 9 and 10 hour days (during peak). Most of the time you will feel like a number because they come to you about scan rates. I honestly don't think any of the managers or PA's can hit the scan rates themselves!!! If you are not cool with the PA's or managers be prepared to scan everyday unless you speak up and ask to do other things. The same people work inbound, sort slide, small sort, problem solve, and PIT all the time. They also will call flex downs at break and then take them back. Twilight shift does the majority of the work while night shift has barely any. We were told during orientation that after six months we would get"
good,"So happy to be away from this place! The managers and everyone else do NOT do their jobs correctly. I enjoyed the time there because of the constant workout, other than that, No! If you get hurt on the job, they dont care and you get told to leave!!"
good,"A typical day at work consists of meeting daily production goals such as hourly rate (110 UPH - Units per Hour), I've learned much about the founding of Amazon and the immense scope of the Amazon brand."
good,Enjoyed working as a Team Lead but I did not see much opportunity to progress as high as I would like.
good,"They only offer 4 hour shifts, little to no room offered for advancement. You spend your shift walking in circles or up and down a line, or rebuilding pallets because no one else can understand that little boxes are bad as support. You get one ""15"" minute break, but it is actually closer to under 10 minutes as the time to walk from where you are to the break room and get through security is part of the 15 minute break."
good,"meeting your rates daily is a must. very challenging when there is insufficient work or spaces to stow items. i have acquired additional habit not to be a loser. "
good,"The job is what it is, a job. They are a company that looks down on the employee like children not adults. Working at Amazon gets very boring at time, but again, it's a job."
good,"Good for college kids to make fast good money. Long days and when it's hot out it's hotter inside, when it's cold out it's freezing inside. You will have to work fast or lose your job. Parking and working around peak time is crazy."
good,Would be a better company if communication was better and advancement opportunities were essential.
good,"a typical day at amazon warehouse consisted of getting at 645 when the shift began, from the clocking in, we were required to move to our designated location. once in our designated location, we were led in group stretches, from the stretches, we were required to go to our assigned work station. once at the assigned work station, we began by making sure that our station was both clean, and well stocked for our shift. once we finished the check, we were required to begin working. management changed each night due to the shift and when they were scheduled. some of the managers were very quick and attentive to problems, where as others were not as attentive and because of it, problems were left not fixed. my co-workers were good, everyone for the most part liked the job. the hardest part of the job, was being on my feet in one space for 10+ hours. the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and making new friends."
good,"warehouse work, but recommended for anyone looking for short term work"
good,"long day productive"
good,"A typical day would consist of usually picking orders "
good,Amazon takes a certain type of personality to succeed. They may be customer focused but not employee focused. No support for career growth. Areasthe business is not focused on tend to struggle. Not a fun place to work.
good,"fast pasted"
good,Empresa de grande porte mais com baixa estrutura e pouca oportunidade de crescimento.
good,Was an OK place to work.  Decent pay.  Managers come and go way too fast.  No room for advancement.
good,"equipo bueno, café gratis, todo ordenado, bajo mi valoración muy exigentes"
good,Meet alot of great poeple and was a good work excperacne just wish the uper managment would have been a little better. Mangers changed almost every two months in each department . . .  makes it hard on they assisactes
good,"I really enjoy the people that I do work with. Amazon just has a huge turn over rate that I am not comfortable with. Not just with with employee but with management as well."
good,"on a regular day we get a certain amont of items we have to shipout through out the day. our goal is to succeed and failure is neber the option. Ten hours four days a week is mandatory, with over time sometimes."
good,a typical day at work would be very quiet. Even when you where the most expensive and comfortable shoes. Your feet will kill you from standing or walking all day. Seen to many people quit due to that. Management was demanding. Very demanding. Hardest part about the job is standing up straight in one spot. I didn't really enjoy it to be honest.
good,Learned how to do inventory control and problem solving. It does get really busy during Christmas time and there are a lot of people there so it will be VERY busy
good,fun job there were always drawing for gas cards and they gave away a brand new car
good,Very good pay and a set schedule was nice. Management was always changing things without knowing the best way to actually change it and then blamed the employees for being slower then before when we had no help. Management was very frustrating to deal with.
good,Enjoying a fun laughable day meeting people from across the world.
good,Is a good place to work for depends on one's overall ambitions. It offers alot of benefits
good,"As a picker, you walk for 9 hours of the day with little time to socialize. If you are hired through a temporary agency, you do not get the same treatment as permanent workers."
good,there isnt a typical day at amazon. each day is different . which is a good thing. I learned a great deal about working a line in the factory.Management is hired from the outside the building  and usally just graduated college students.Hardest part about the job is working with people that doesnt care about what there doing. what i loved about the job is after a hard day at work i felt like i accomplished something.
good,"rapidité,ponctualité,beaucoup d'effort physique et de pression."
good,"Amazon has a solid foundation.  They have a lot of very intelligent and smart individuals working for them and they are doing great things.  Advancement opportunities are limited in my specific location and would require moving back to Washington state, which is not my preference."
good,"thousand of parcel is coming back to station with different status and we have to deal with every single one under target time ."
good,the management was horrible and no pre-work planning took place (if so it was thought out by a toddler) we were sent home when work was plentiful and kept over if there was nothing to do.
good,"I worked hard. I had a problem with management because they played favorites. They let people drink on the job. When it was reported no one did anything about it. "
good,The typical day can be long but you're kept very busy. It would be nice if the company took more time to recognize and appreciate their employees. The most difficult part is the daily and weekly assesments when you're not meeting a strict production rate. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work with others and talk when allowed.
good,"Journée type : arriver entre 10 min et 2 min avant la sonnerie pour ouvrir toutes les applications dont on va avoir besoin pour travailler. Après la sonnerie 5 min de gym (réveil musculaire) 5 min de réunion rapide pour savoir le travail qui nous reste à faire et ce qui doit arriver 5 min pour se rendre à son poste avec son ordi pour ceux qui sont sur les mobiles (compté dans le temps de travail). "
good,"cut throat placement with good ole boy club mentality, fluffing the books to keep enough staff for their needs, outbound employee is gonna have it rough"
good,Amazon is a great place to work for Career advancement. You get to work with really smart people and you are given autonomy and ownership of your work. The flip side is that everyone works a lot of hours and do not really have a work life balance. People tend to burn out within a couple of years and move on to other opportunities.
good,easy job but politics hurt the people thats really trying to do things with the company
good,"Great technologies."
good,"É um hotel com apenas 6 meses de existência com 96 aptos e ótimo de se trabalhar. Estou aqui desde março de 2013, portanto acompanhei toda sua implantação. Hoje, apesar da rotatividade de funcionários (adaptações) tem sido para mim, um desafio satisfatório pois tudo só tem aumentado a minha experiencia principalmente com o setor de pessoal. 80% dos nossos hóspedes vem a negócios tonando a rotina bem mais fácil de trabalhar."
good,"Not challenging enough. Co-workers are great, Good opportunity to progress so far. The hardest part of the job is the fact no-body will listen to your ideas or ask opinions they bring in new things and even if they are worse they stick."
good,"Laid back work environment and OK pay but not a secure job and no advancement.What I hated the most was ""coaches"", supervisors/managers reminded you how you could lose your job any day."
good,"Grateful for the opportunity I had working at Amazon. I might not have been the best job, but it helped provide for me and my family."
good,"it was a good job to work at wish I had stayed there a little longer, although my assignment was seasonal I learned a lot"
good,"At Amazon, one can have huge impact on the products and have high visibility overall. If you are crazy about work and just work then it is a good company for you. The co workers here are smart but the culture is individualistic"
good,Not nearly as organized as a company this size should be.  Managers seem to not know what they are doing and just kinda wing it.  Communication is terrible between departments and even out to the workers.  Benefits are not bad but the pay is not enough for anyone who has a family or other responsibilities.
good,People are tough to work with. Might end up doing something totally different than what was promised before interview.
good,The Company is ok. It's just that they do not pay well enough for the amount of work and effort put in. It is very stressful to work in this company
good,The harder you worked for Amazon the more they required from you..
good,"Overall, Amazon.com is a challenging, intense place to work. No two days are the same and there are always new challenges and opportunities. A typical day begins with compiling the days projected volume and computing the number of man hours I will need to accomplish our goals. Through the course of the day I check in freight, assist the problem solvers, continuously track my departments performance and volume, deliver associate feedback,  while seeing to any associate needs and their safety. "
good,"A day at work consists of counting inventory, and finding any defects that may have arisen during the receive or stow process. Also maintaining a rate of 150/hr for a simple bin count, and 16/hr for a cycle count, and at the same time making sure you have no quality defects on your part of counting, all of this counts against you. This is a repetitive job, same thing every day, there is no room for advancement at this company."
good,"I got to train people on how to do the stow job right and train people hands on with PIT and give them a driving test . The management on night shift was too laid back and only concerned about how much was done. When they always say Safety, Quality, then Productivity, and Attendance in that order  but they want Productivity first."
good,"The biggest downfall of working at amazon.com is the insecurity of the job. One week its busy, the next its quiet, the following week your out of a job."
good,the work was consistent and hard but also a rewarding company to owrk for
good,The fullillment center is a face pace company. Co workers are friendly. A lot of the managers shows favoritism. Its not good for a new FC. The hardest part about the job is getting approve for my school hours.
good,"Amazon is growing, hence someone who likes challenges and wants to grow the business would appreciate his/her time with them."
good,"typical day at work 10-12 fast paced lots of walking, Being that i worked overnight the hardest part of the job was focusing after 5 in the a.m"
good,Varies widely on which part of the company you work at and your immediate manager.
good,"Amazon is full of bright A-personalities, unfortunately, with little/no documentation and training it can be a difficult place to work."
good,"Früh und Spätschicht, das ist aber in Ordnung, Wohnortnah für mich gelegen."
good,"A typical day at Amazon as a Order Picker is hard work. You are on your feet for 10hrs+ , you have a 30min lunch break, with two 15min breaks. You're constantly speed walking back and forward from aisle to aisle, 1st to 2nd to 3rd floor , pallet land to library, kneeling, climbing on ladders to reach the top of the shelves, etc. Somedays it's cold, and somedays it's extra hot. You get sick working there due to all the dustiness. The management of their company is terrible, the higher power plays favoritism. You will come across a few loyal co-workers, most of them are rude and messy ( drama ). The hardest part about this job is being on your feet for 10hrs+ .Every Friday (payday) is the only enjoyable part about this job."
good,its ok. pay sucks managment is a joke. Dont give a s*** about their employees. Benefits are the only thing keepin me put.
good,Long hours in hot conditions learned nothing management sucks co-workers are good people hardest part is walking ten miles a day
good,"Job was not complicated. Very fast paced. Very demanding. As long as you are willing to work your butt off, you will do well here."
good,Packing customers orders.
good,Job was a seasonal job did not work there very long at all. A typical day at work was alright hard work some day but was not a problem. Management out there was not the best they need to work more on people skills.
good,Really good to work for.Working for the company is good because you can get discount on all products.
good,1) The work is of fun in the starting days but as the days passes by the work will be so routine that it doesn't change even after years like a stereotype.
good,It is a pretty standard warehouse environment. Not much room to advance.
good,Early Start late finish
good,"worked 4 days out of the week 10 hour days with one 15 min break and 30 min lunch, long hours. co-workers were friendly. hardest part was working hard long hours and having little time for breaks."
good,"the management staff with the amazon side of the house was great. however, the way that the company works you and then just discards you kind of leaves a sour taste in your mouth"
good,"very labour intensive job,u are on ur feet all day,worked with some awesome managers..part time job with limited work hours..worked with very helpful co works"
good,"The job is for someone who isn’t looking for an exciting/ challenging experience."
good,"I worked little time in there. "
good,It is a pretty fun place to work in general but amazon is very disorganized and doesn't necessarily care for its workers too much. Ever changing rules and policies make it hard to get too comfortable.
good,Acheter une bonne paire de baskets et être motivé.
good,"The hours were good "
good,"This is not a long term job for anyone who has a desire to go beyond the warehouse field. If your goal is make money, and then move on. It might be a perfect fit for you."
good,Very good company to work for. The managers are very helpfull. They look after you all.... sometimes work can be too much but really hard as the day starts to go dark as the addresses are hard to find or house names
good,I like working there.  Management is concerned about safety.  My shift time is a concern.  Very early in the morning.  I do work a second job so it can be hard at times.Overall it is good.
good,Area Manager was often missing and when a new Area Manager came in I had to train them even though I did most of their job. Owning your department and seeing the production meet par and even go above standards was very rewarding.
good,Amazon est une bonne entreprise le seul soucis selon moi c'est qu'elle n'embauche pas suffisamment
good,"Can be fired easily, will say you are more important but can and will be replaced like nothing. Otherwise it's a great place to learn to manage your time."
good,Very physical labor for semi decent wage. Great managers. PTO is weird. Only earned during certain times of the year. Good benefits. No cell phones on work floor.
good,"La empresa es buena, tienen excelente trato al cliente y a sus agentes."
good,"You clock in, use a scanner and scan boxes onto pallets. The job gets boring after a while. That is basically it, the training lasts two shifts that vary in length. The average is 3.5 hours per shift."
good,"A typical workday is usually Competitive and challenging, Long Hours Standing (Usually 10 hours or more). the work process is Fast-paced, Rate/ performance-based.If you're lucky enough to have fair managers they would be fair in there dealing then you can be assured of a steady upward progression, else they would have their faithfuls, friends, Girlfriends have the few select positions."
good,"Amazon is an amazing company to work if you are in the right team and has the right management. "
good,Too much work demand for few associates. Managers sometimes seemed lost to solve simple problems. Many people working incorrectly without receiving any kind of warning.
good,"Just know what type of person you are and talk to people about it that work there, do not go in blind.  I made that mistake that i swallowed what i heard and didnt ""dive deep"" , it is a very self-service company!!!!"
good,"Simple, this job should only be looked at as a second job. I’m one of the day one employees for Prime Now shopping, "
good,Company pushes too hard. Does not care about employees.  Unrealistic expectations.  Overwork employees. Short breaks. Short lunch. Long days doing the same thing over and over again.
good,"Enjoyed working with the people at Amazon.  However, there is a total lack of job security and it is often a case of who you know to get the more favourable jobs."
good,"Le salaire est trop bas pour une société qui marche autant."
good,Pour moi l’ambiance de travail est agréable grâce à la musique mais en contrepartie il est très compliqué d’avoir un poste à long terme là-bas si on entre en pleine période Q4.
good,"Fun job. i miss the driving, all the neighborhoods i would visit, and the autonomy. I didn't like the threat of dogs - unfortunate by product of the job. And details on how the job is to be performed (breaks, qouta, etc.) didn't match what actually is capable in the field (didn't have time for a break, if you wanted to finish on time), but they implored you to take your breaks."
good,"Cons- It was very busy, short breaks, not enough hours. The be"
good,"Typical warehouse work, duties performed depends totally on which shift is chosen.  Managers are flexible and willing to help.  The hardest part of the job is heavy lifting and standing all day.  Most days are fun as it is a team environment."
good,"Frustrating is putting it lightly. There are so many unbelievably costly flaws in the Amazon owned delivery service AMZL that not only waste mind blowing amounts of money and time but cause very real heartache and disappointment all the way around from the customer to the delivery driver to the CSA trying to figure out a long term solution. This is not only discouraged in a big way, but nearly impossible as there is no time given to actually fix a heinous failure, only to implement the old stop gap measure- a refund and perhaps a small credit for their trouble."
good,Ces un travail passionnant mais avec beaucoup de contraintes et peut informations
good,"My experience at Amazon was a good one I work there for the holiday season, they had good incentives and I learned a lot . Over all my experience was a good one, unfortunately it was seasonal."
good,"Working at Amazon was a great to learn how to work in a warehouse in a fast-paced environment. The management, unfortunately, was not on the same page and did things very differently from each other that you constantly did not know if you were doing things properly or not."
good,"You work from the time you clock in until the end of shift. Depending on what position you are will depending on how much standing, walking, lifting and stooping you will do. Most managers will constantly monitor your progress to make sure you are making rate. If you fail to make rate consistent you will be wrote up. Best part about the job is just the benefits that you get but it really is needed when putting lots of stress on your body ."
good,clock in and go to your station for 10 hours and watch everyone not do work because theyre all lazy kids and you get exhausted quick but its fair pay .
good,Management tried there best but lied about keeping anyone past seasonal drivers and ended up firing every delivery driver they hired easily 300-500 people
good,I've worked with Amazon on and off the past few years during the peak season so my opinions on the company and the way they conduct business aren't as accurate as could be.
good,"I’d like to think I was fast at working at Amazon but I clearly wasn’t and some people who clearly deserved a permanent position did hear anything from management. Also Amazon only really care about hitting targets, but once you do your stuck in a cycle."
good,"Good place to make some temporary money, but you must be prepared for long hours shift. During the work days we don’t have a life, is basically bed/eat/work. Colleagues are mostly friendly and they will help you more than any leader or manager. If you’re not from any Eastern European country the chances of getting a permanent contract will be reduced. You clearly see some privileges bbeing giving t"
good,"Not everyone can work easily with Amazon, challenging duties"
good,This job started me off to getting great work experience with great people who had been there for to help you along the way. I am appreciative and thankful
good,Only drawback is that management do not care for the good workers because they can not do nothing for them. Hiring or ending a workers contract is some company policy so they won't have to give nobody a permanent contract.
good,The pay is great and theres plenty of overtime.Nice clean work environment.But...The work is very hard and stressful and the lunch break time is stolen from you because of the long walk it takes to get to the break area from your work station.
good,The people were exceptionally polite. But we were trained for day one twice and still had no clue how to perform the job. Other than that it was great
good,It was okay . Really nice job . It was a bit difficult. But it was good pay . The shifts were short . Barely had any shifts for the 600 people in the job
good,"I really enjoyed working at Amazon, but the wage was not enough for me to be able to thrive at that time. I became an Amazon Ambassador and even tried to advance but when that did not happen, I decided to move on to a better paying job."
good,Don’t want to work there it’s terrible the work conditions are terrible the management is terrible the food In break room is terrible and lots of favoritism
good,"Les cadres veillent scrupuleusement à  l'application des règles de sécurité  (safty)"
good,"Plenty of walking to keep you fit as a picker. Idle time allows you to be seen as a robot as even toilet hunts and breaks count towards idle time."
good,"The hardest part of the work is the noise and the fact that all day long standing, Amazon is a very busy work environment and productivity is more important than safety."
good,"overall it's a good place to work, good pay and the actual physical labor isnt bad. Management isnt very personal and it feels like its overly focused on making money. Human resources department have nice people"
good,"Ambiente lavorativo molto bello e moderno.. ma purtroppo troppo pretendenti , troppe consegne al giorno , 100 /110 addirittura fino a 120 fermate.. tutto questo con ritmo molto veloce altrimenti si rimane indietro con le consegne e cominciano a chiamarti per dirti di muoverti e di fare più veloce."
good,"weren't allowed to interact with anyone near by, if caught talking it was a strike against you. Breaks throughout the shift were too spaced apart and weren't long enough to break up the 12 hour shift."
good,"For the most part, it's very fast paced, very heavy lifting and it's for the militant. I worked so hard and fast that I'd lost 20 lbs my first 2 months. It's stressful because they play mind games to keep you moving fast for 10-12 hrs daily, even though your rates are above where they require. For the particular job I did, it should pay at LEAST 19$ hrly. It was just a bit much."
good,"Hard work, flexible days of work, nice pay an hour, lack of hours, rude management, pretty easy labor work inside of the plant........................"
good,"This is a typical warehouse position. It is not great, nor is it terrible. Management is obsessed with unimportant stats that detract from actual productivity, but tend to be pretty patient and understanding overall."
good,"You will stand the entire shift including overtime so find some good insoles.  Management is pretty hands off after training.  Training was easy enough.  There is always that ""one person"" at every job, but I met some pretty cool people, but again, be ready to stand, stand, and stand some more."
good,"Not a bad job just the management don't care about you as a person, you are just a number. You also get warnings for being off sick even if you have a fit note to cover  you."
good,Good job with good benefits but after the holiday season keep the pace up or there's a good chance for termination. Keep your pace up and it can lead your shift to extra cash. Very competitive atmosphere and extremely fast paced.
good,I don't regret working there however it is difficult to sustain as the pace of work is very fast and there is considerable stress to keep up with increasingly difficult goals. However the pay is competitive and there is a strong sense of pride in the organization at being the best.
good,You literally go to work stand on your feet for 10 hours a day and go home. You are treated like a number there so don't expect special treatment. Management is a joke.
good,"You  will be on your feet for 10 or more hours per day, the only people allowed to sit during their shift are members of HR.  The system is automated, if you go negative on your hours you will be automatically terminated."
good,"The pay is great but the hours are long and the job is really demanding. Your standing for hours , everything you do is timed and if you don't perform you get retrained twice then terminated."
good,Hours are to long. No union management suck can get fired for absolutely anything peak season suck you have to work more hours and days but the overall work isn’t hard at all
good,It's always busy and its very diverse. The hardest part of the job is loading the trucks. Depending on what department you work in You learn  different skills.
good,"My manger was very good and was very polite by nature."
good,"They want you to meet a certain amount of items processed a night but don’t take everyone into consideration. If you get ten below that number, you jeopardize your job."
good,It wasn't a good job for me the management team was not very good and my trading was not very professional. when I need help and was not provided. With the proper equipment for the job I was told by one of the managers to just deal with it.
good,"Great opportunities to advance, there is the good and the bad but mostly bad due to management and politics. Some people work hard but are not giving recognition, while others do very little and management does not care due to personal bias. things work the opposite way."
good,"Amazon has wonderful benefits for employees and you can make some serious money during their peak season. However, you are managed by a computer system that monitors your rate in pick and pack. Your time off task is monitored, so easy on bathroom breaks, or your real manager may be waiting right outside to inform you a computer told them you were off task. Dehumanizing!"
good,"Is a challenging work environment, the Supervisors are great. They are always willing to help you out. They always set realistic target and monitor the achievement frequently."
good,Fast paced but amazing experience and good skill acquisition. So much to get done there that you can feel like a machine instead of a person. If you have a good manager it can make all the difference.
good,"Amazon is good place to get your first job and earn money for your expenses and to save some. You do not have to lift heavy items as limit is up to 15kg. "
good,The job was alright    The managers were not the best but the people were fun to work with         The ability to cross train was great but many exceptions to help out all the departments when needed
good,"Is a nice place to work every day, with many people friendly and easy job. the salary is normal, and the interview is easy. the managers were helped me , and they are so friendly."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Work is labor intensive. For 15.50 an hour they expect you to work as if you’re making 30.00 an hour. It’s a paycheck. You’re just a body scanning on a lane. Very little room for growth. Snacks and drinks are expensive. No paper cups for water at the end of the lanes. They could definitely improve things but may not. Don’t feel very safe there, metal detectors  on site are not used."
good,I liked working there but for such a big company so many employees they don’t promote or offer raises based on your performance more based on how long you worked for them I would hit double rate almost everyday became a problem solver with more responsibilities but no higher pay it’s a lot of competition I would really like to see they give off bonuses instead of prizes for your rate they would only do power hour so whatever your rate was within that hour the best man wins but what about the people who hit double rate monthly no prizes for them?
good,Ottimo ambiente soprattutto sulla sicurezza sul lavoro
good,"Very intense environment, little work life balance. Ability to push back is key, lots of opportunity to think big if on the right team. A lean operation so managing priorities is key"
good,Fast paced environment which is really good. Like that there is no time for gossips and laziness because everybody is busy working for real not like any other Companies. In and Out cause time goes fast.
good,Il faut du chiffre du chiffre et encore du chiffre. Vraiment un poste pour un emploi de passage.
good,"Una recensione su Amazon è piuttosto soggettiva, per quello che posso dire mi sono trovato meglio in altri posti lavorativi, ritmi e controlli un po troppo esigenti, avendo la sede lavorativa molto lontano da casa trovavo difficile gestire la mia vita privata, con i colleghi mi sono trovato bene. Ripeto, è soggettiva come recensione."
good,"management sucked at the time, don't apply if you do not have transportation. Very easy work. just scanning packages and putting the box on correct designated pallet area"
good,Not the greatest environment and not a very fulfilling job apart from that it was ok. The people are friendly and helpful and the food is great. Amazon itself seemed like a good company and helped when they could.
good,"Amazing place. Young and passionate crowd. Diverse crowd at work place. It is one of the best thing about the company. Due to expansion, Amazon is hiring high number of graduates."
good,"Amazon est une grande firme on ne s'attend donc pas à travailler sans la présence de stress et de pression de la part des dirigeants."
good,I felt like I was just was not wanted there even though I provided alot for the company. I put tremindous amounts of wffort without even getting a pat on the back.
good,You never got left alone. You have to work in a well fast-paced work area. You have targets to complete. I will never work there again. It is an alright place to work. You also get 2 half hour breaks now. You get one paid and one unpaid.
good,"Was not happy working every Friday & Saturday, 10 hours shifts are difficult if you don't drive. Travel time made my working day 12 hours. Days off were Sunday, Monday Tuesday, no social life as friends would be working."
good,"When I first worked there, it wasn't bad at all. Actually it was pretty fun and everyone was nice and the manager got a better position and we got a very bad childish manager, and it got really bad and things changed for the worse. It all depends on the manager and their work plan because it can make you feel like a team or feel like drama in high school."
good,Great place to learn and be creative on finding solutions. The extreme drive to be best in class causes management to burn out quickly due to multiple days of work without a break or rest.
good,"Just finished my last day. Job description doesn’t cover how physically demanding the job is nor does it tell you that you are expected to be under ten seconds takt time, and if you don’t get there after four weeks you start getting write ups. I experienced knee pain from the sped of running up and down the ladder and everything they expect you to operate at. I was told if I had my ortho doctor validate this with paperwork I could switch to a different department that didn’t involve stairs. First day after doctor I was sent home by HR. Second day I was put back to stowing and told that despite my doctor not wanting me to do stairs or squatting, if iI didn’t ‘do it all’ I would be sent home again.  So I worked. The third time i talked to HR they told me they would accommodate me in scant. I returned to work and was again sent to stow. The decant manager said he was never told I was going to be in his department. I put my notice in that day. I realize my fulfillment center is new, but the communication is AWFUL. HR is a train wreck."
good,"Receive incoming packages and sorting packages to be deleivered to customers. Management changed every few month, as did the work schedule changed every three months. Pay was good, hours where short."
good,il y a trop de stresse et manque de communication.
good,"Don’t have personal issues because you will be fired if you go negative in your UPT! I worked so hard I hurt myself and was let go because they denied my request for an exception of my unplanned absence! But of course they had me work 9 hours before firing me today! Amazon told me I was re hireable in 365 days, really? No thanks and Merry Christmas I said as I was escorted out! Thanks Amazon"
good,"Amazon is a decent place to work if you are willing to hustle and get things done in a fast-paced environment.."
good,"I very much enjoy the excersize, the people I have met, and the simple tasks. I would have liked the opportunity to advance and with pay. I would also like the opportunity for more hours or at least to stay the full shift assigned to me."
good,Not a good place for experienced and some one serious in life.good for part time job.if you are a fresher just spent sometime it's okay but not for people who want to build a career.
good,Fast paced work environment with little to no training. You get 2 ride along days after some useless classroom training then youre on your own. Confused and expected to succeed. Bosses driven by numbers . They want you to be safe and also work as quickly as possible
good,Amazon Warehouse is not a place where you work as a career. It's about moving up while Amazon willing to support you with your future career tuitions.
good,"Inbound Stow position had a consist work pace. The Managers were good but changed a lot. There was a lot of emphasis on maintaining rate, which could be stressful at times."
good,"Cha1 is a guinea pig plant. Whatever new things they wanted to try came to that plant first. It may have changed now. I don’t know... overall though, it was a decent place to work for."
good,It's a nice environment to work in but peek season was a little crazy. It was kind of like you lived there with all the hours we had to work. But the money was good and so was the benefits.
good,"Overall it was a decent place to work, only thing lacking was opportunity for growth because, management didn't have the best communication skills with employees."
good,"- relaxed atmosphere but fast paced work schedule "
good,"Hors mis les heures des pauses société responsables et let à disposition des travailleurs un cadre agréable, salle de repas avec équipement dédié, sécurité respecté. seul bémol en 10h de travail 30 minutes de pause."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working for Amazon. My only issue ever was management and how each individual building is run. The company has everything set in place for it to run as smoothly as it possibly can.
good,"In the Global Catalogue operation,the role is purely based on the operation like back-end work."
good,Nothing much.  Depends where and which department we join in amazon.not all the departments are like that. I felt non tech have become too much of micromanaging. And too much of pressure without recognizing of an idividual
good,"Amazon Saran,"
good,"Amazon is what you make of it. You can work 80-100 a week or you can do the 8-5 but feel like you are not pulling your weight if you try to do a work life balance. Its intense but you have fun at the same time, We work hard, Play hard, but then it doesnt leave alot of room for much else."
good,"Overall it’s an okay place to work very busy , managers are wack just won’t work done change the rules every month 15$ a hr, sometimes will feel underpaid for the amount of work to"
good,"The company treats you as a robot not a human being, has wildly crazy expectations on rate and time off task (even when bathrooms/break rooms are far from the area you are assigned). work is hard and often times very exhausting. however, there are some good points like benefits, SOME managers are great, others not so much. The community within the associates is really awesome."
good,Instead of leadership at the company delegating tasks and issuing responsibilities to appropriate reports there would be an overwhelming sense of chaos which inhibited quick and responsive action to the problems at hand.
good,"amazon is very demanding and rightfully so.  You are to be on top of your game, and mistakes must be kept to an absolute min.  You have a quota to meet and as long as you do they will leave you alone, but if you can't then you will be talked too.  So be prepared for coaching if you can't keep up.  Very intensive labor, not a lot of machinery at least there was not when I had to leave the company to take care of my dad."
good,"Working 10 and a half hours for 4 days would be nice but with amazon they don't give you enough time to take your breaks. Even the 30 minute paid break isn't actually 30 minutes. You're expected to leave your station at the start of your break, start working at the end of it. It would not be a problem if your station was right next to the breakroom. But stations are so far away from it your break is expected to be cut short. and on a 10 hour shift it's bad."
good,consegne in locazioni assurde con furgoni troppo grandi da raggiungere.
good,Amazon is not a flexible job and they do not care about associates issues. The hr team was not helping solve problems that only the hr  team can solve. Sometimes unorganized with the time of letting associates when sorts would end.
good,"Very physically demanding position with overrated expectations. "
good,"They start you off doing all the groundwork for others to take credit and leave you stuck in the same role, the pay is not sufficient for the cost of living and if you're stuck in a small team, they only play favorites for your advancement."
good,"Was a lot better when it was still Ring, before Amazon bought them out. Was more about pushing a product instead of excellent customer service. Once you don't care about the customers, shame."
good,"The job served its purpose as I didn't expect much, warehouse work which i never experienced. You must have endurance. you are on a constant time limit."
good,"A great job for those who dont have an education and are getting started out in life but wouldn't really recommend it for people with experience unless you go for a management position or higher. You get paid a flat rate and its a steady 40 hours a week which isnt bad at all but the work is not enjoyable. The expectations that you are supposed to meet are unrealistic. I have met alot of good people while working there and it has help me not go insane while doing the repetitive tasks that the job asks of you. The management can be really good or just really bad, there is no in between."
good,"amazon is a great opportunity for young people to get started and familiar with a working environment but not a good place to have a a career the management is awful and you need to be part of ""the group"" to advance very high school type of vibe. and from what i've hear this is the case all over the world."
good,"Trying to switch teams is a dangerous thing. You have NOT to tell your manager until the process is complete or you'll be in danger to be pivoted."
good,Worked at Amazon for a year and was denied conversion after my direct managers were not involved with the conversion process. Despite being in a critical role the HR team involved with the conversions passed by my application. Do not recommend a career here as everyone gets overworked and burned out.
good,"You learn one job like scan and pack items for shipment or stow away merchandise and that's what you do all day long. Also you have to be fast enough to meet your daily rate or you get written up and fired. Most of the time management left us alone and you can work and chat with person next to you.  They have contests, special events, and company picnic."
good,"Overall it is a hard job, but once you get use to everything and everyone it is kinda fun some nights. Just staying focused and taking care of your body is a must."
good,"If your not in good shape, you will not last long. Eat right, drink a lot of water, stay in comfortable shoes. Take the breaks that are givin and always use 3 pionts of contact, always help your co-workers get their route done because everyone wants to go home."
good,"A typical day you will be working a steady task with little room for error; if you are focused you can breeze through. You will roughly be on your feet for a minimum of 11 hours so it is best to wear good, comfortable shoes and support for them as well. The hardest part with the job was not the hours, but balancing work/home life; if you can manage that then Amazon may be something you could consider. The pay was good, and at the time Amazon offered good benefits, so I would look into that if it suits your needs. I would not recommend having this as a career, use this as a stepping stone for something you will enjoy later."
good,"I got hurt on the job, made a case about it. Closed that case due to injury not bothering me. Ended up going to the er for that injury before work. Went to have my time excused for being late due to ER. And the onsite care center accused me of lying saying it wasnt a onsite injury. I wasnt gonna argue so I quit. wasnt gonna be accused of something that wasnt true."
good,"Un travail c'est certain."
good,40 hours a week space over 4 days with weekly pay was good along with the weekly pay. However the management and the agencies were rude and belittling along with being unreasonable
good,"Ok, just very stressful trying to maintain hourly quota. Standing all day for 2 breaks and a half-hour for lunch was difficult if you are a person with joint issues."
good,"I worked part-time in Amazon's Prime Now warehouse, it didn't come in with high expectations as it's a warehouse position. If you don't mind repetitive physical work for about 5 to 10 hours (depending on how you choose your schedule) and various temperature controlled zones then this is the place for you."
good,"Lack of communication/"
good,Absolutely do not care about their employees. Fired for the last possible reason they can muster up. Very low morale. Seems as though you can never please management.
good,Buona esperienza lavorativa responsabili e lavoro di squadra
good,"Das Motto lautet zwar ""Every day is day one"" aber dennoch ist es täglich das Gleiche."
good,If you are okay with a warehouse setting then this is for you. Amazon is  very fast pace place. If you are unable to keep up they will let you go after while.
good,A lots of going up and down stairs and excess walking.the hardness thing was when the bins were fill you had to kept going to you found a empty bin so you may how to cover whole floor before finding one.
good,"Amazon is a great place to work for benefit wise however the hours can be difficult and there's a lot of things done the ""amazon way"" that if you work there, you will figure out what it means."
good,As a stower you are expected to meet a daily quota of 3600 per day.  This is out of your control on what product you get as it is distributed to your stations by pallets.  Management makes a round to each station once per day if you're lucky to notify you how you're doing.
good,a typical day at work involves picking up the company's car then go to the warehouse load all the packages. after you pick up the packages you start delivering and when you done delivering you come back to the warehouse to drop the car.
good,The focus on the production goals is at the cost of the employees security and health. And there hiring process in terrible. Also the process of the warehouse is very disorganized in many areas.
good,"Decent company to work for. VERY fast paced, calls back to back and a lot of multi tasking. Good training provided. Good benefits available first day of hire!"
good,"My experience while working for Amazon could have been better, because I have worked there for almost 8 years and never got the opportunity to advance. They would always hire outside the company, instead of giving their employees the opportunity to get the positions they were hiring for. I feel the ones that already know about the job and have been there for so long should have first priority at receiving the position. They have poor management."
good,They over work you and you don’t get paid enough. They say they care but they don’t. I feel like I’m at work more than at home. I’m to tired to do anything when I get home.
good,"Working at Amazon was interesting. I think experiences vary widely depending on which organization and team you are a part of. I know people who are run ragged, and others who enjoy great balance between their professional and personal time. In most cases I was surrounded by capable, thoughtful, and articulate people -- which was VERY nice. The company is run like a thousand companies under one umbrella. There can be a frustrating lack of communication between internal organizations, but the autonomy this structure provides has advantages as well. There were those trying to climb the ladder, and more rarely, those trying to hide the fact that they have no business climbing a ladder at all by tugging others off the ladder."
good,pretty typical and mundane at times. But for the most part management was fairly nice but they had favorites who they would defer too on a daily basis.
good,lots of favoritism and harassment from certain  mangers and if you tried to get them into trouble you most likely get into some sort of trouble  to transfer to a less desirable department
good,I loved working at the delivery station and when I had to relocate I was happy to continue to working with Amazon though the transfer process wasn’t as smooth as one would hope. So I resigned and applied back to Amazon but this time went to a fulfillment center...this is where it all went downhill. In a nutshell if leadership was more associates that have worked on the floor and actually have done the job then  I’m sure things would be much better
good,Amazon is a warehouse.  They care about production more than it's associates.  There is a high turnover.   They just don't care about their employee's beyond having a competitive salary.
good,I worked in a warehouse in Las Vegas were there was no air conditioning. It would get to over 100 degrees in the warehouse but they would not give us the extra breaks they said that we were supposed to get by law. There were people who passed out on occasions because of the heat. There was no reason for the facility to not be temperature controlled. Productivity is all they care about.
good,"Working at an amazon warehouse is like no other job. They have many pros and cons within the company, many associates like and dislike working there due to the work we do and how much we get paid."
good,"If you want to learn a ton and grow fast this is a great place, you will have to sacrifice you work life balance though. If you are earlier in your career then you should give it a try."
good,"Be prepared to work. If you can scan boxes for 4-5 hours straight this is the job for you. you'll get one ""15 minute"" break. The quotes are because they want you to finish your break at minute thirteen because they know it takes two minutes to get to and from the break site so really it's an eleven-minute break. So if you can take being cheated out of your one break a shift this job is for you. You'll also have managers but when I was there they called them ""ambassadors."" These guys walk up and down the site really fast to make you think they're working. In all fairness, I'm sure they have their own duties but it'll get under your skin after a while because they'll be telling what to do while looking busy. The regular associate is the hardest working person on the floor never forget that. Their benefits are good though."
good,"**Please look at pros and cons for cliff notes**"
good,Amazon gave good benefits with a raise every 6 months and many other coverages. They basically paid for the required safety shoes needed. Overall it was tough working there because of the amount of heavy labour.
good,"Fun workplace but poor management . Hired management team are not living the company's vision and mission. But overall, the workplace is clean and fun,"
good,I work in Chesapeake Virginia in a warehouse Southern temperatures no air condition fast paced boxes of every shape size and weight and they don't care about your body if you get hurt they will throw you over in a pile of rags and move on to the next one
good,Bidding on shifts is a horrible way to do things and people who had been working there for years couldn't get any shifts for weeks. Management wouldn't do anything about it and there was no real benefit for someone to hold this position.
good,My primary job was to sort packages and load delivery trucks. You did the job and went home. Nothing was difficult about it. It was more a physical job versus a mental one.
good,"The laid-back culture of the company can be fun and comfortable. At the same time, probably because of the fame and the size of the company, amazon can be very arrogant. They do not appreciate their associates. Also, it is likely that you will have to work on national holidays - Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Christmas because they are the busiest business days for amazons busieness."
good,Amazon is a great place to work for Tier 1- Tier 3 Associates. The work culture caters to the associate and Amazon managers focus heavily on employee engagement and development. For Area Managers it is the most stressful job but the work is usually rewarding. It is a struggle to find the perfect work-life balance but overall a good experience.
good,"Good company to work for but they do expect you to work 24/7 if you could."
good,When I started working there I enjoyed it after management kept changing it got kind of stressful because the management didn't follow the same rules they had different rules for different days I tried to transfer to a different facility for 6 months and was denied every time so I quit I will probably reapply to a different facility when peak season starts
good,It was a very fast paced day when nothing was going right all the orders was out of place then the team lead seen the problem fixed it then the day went normally planned despite the tension that was in the building.
good,"Got to meet that quota, Loud working conditions, Forced me to go on medical leave for actually going out of my way to get a doctors note for my hand pain I was not allowed to return until I got another note denouncing that initial note."
good,"As a full-time associate, I was expected to work ten hour shifts, four days a week. It's a factory position, so there are some expectations as far as working conditions go. You are given a quota to meet every day and you can expect to walk some miles everyday. That said, expect to be moving continuously throughout your shift. Aside from Lunch, you're only given two 15 minute breaks through your shift. And depending on your location, it could be a 3-5 min walk to the designated break-room and you'll be expected to be on the floor before the time expires."
good,In the beginning working as a Amazon Flex delivery driver the routine was quick pace and not very easy to adapt to but it was a great learning experience for me.
good,"It can be rewarding and it can be fun but only in the non repetitive roles.  Low level management (most of the time fresh out of college grads) tend to be over worked to push rates. As a result, the most productive workers find it hard to move out of their direct roles and learn other task unless they take the incentive themselves."
good,"They cap your hours to keep you unable to receive benefits."
good,Amazon could be a great place to work if they would get the daily work more organized and efficient.  The management is way below par.  They treat the employees like dirt and just stand around barking orders instead of doing any actual work.  Favoring certain employees is a huge problem at my location.
good,"A good second job. requires ure ability to lift, bend and scan packages. paid training. hiring process is very simple, you schedule ure interview. Flexible hours. On average 4-6 hour shift depending on how many packages come in a day."
good,"I worked night shift. Met some amazing people. Still friends to this day. Management was great until he left to open another plant. Downfall from there. Got hurt at work, because of the upper staff. Then got treated badly. If you work for them you can file claims. Once that course is ran then your done type of place. Seattle office makes promises and don't keep them. HR at this plant threatens you if you contact anyone regarding your case. I got bullied by the manager and head hr   bad place if you get hurt. Great place if you can meet quota"
good,"Fast paced work environment with decent pay and hours. However, currently with this position there is a ZERO percent chance of any career advancement and you are severely undervalued as an employee. It is highly unlikely that anything will be done to change this culture because there are so many people desperate for employment that they view you as dispensable despite your work ethic"
good,"Very very hard on your body. During peak, expect to work 50-60 hr work weeks. I was a packer. Not brain surgery and easy if your body can handle the abuse!"
good,Tough place to work. Fast paced and driven by lots of data. Be prepared to have process change and evolve within  a shift ....it's actually called Bias For Action.
good,Good to work for if your part time and good if you just want to work flexible hours no supervisors around you are out driving by yourself make your own pace any weekly paycheck is what you will see
good,"If you have no problem lifting the occasional heavy item (about 50 pounds) and can work at a fast pace without getting distracted by chatty coworkers you'll be fine. Additionally, don't be afraid to ask for help from coworkers."
good,"Amazon is for those who do not need work-life balance. You need to give your life to amazon. In order to advance, you will need to relocate to where they need you. Ideal company for someone who is starting out in their career (no family, willing to drop everything for them). Their vision of HR is not HR, it basically a complaint department for complaints that don't need to occur. They do not screen for fulfillment centers, they just need a pulse which draws people who don't want to work and either want to just get worker's comp (fraud) or quick unemployment benefits."
good,To much work for the money we get... long routes .... to many parcels...  not garanteed to work 5 days a week ... in pich times we get even more volume.... and the routes and numbers of parcel increases in time
good,"overall the compensation is not bad but the amount of work, especially physically, can be very demanding and challenging for any age group. Advancement may take some time and interviews show a lack of interest in the individual skills."
good,They are very suspicious of their own employees. They mistaked me for some One else stealing and fired me. When they found the real person was still there. I was still fired
good,"Not quite a good place to work, but good pay rates/business."
good,You work hard. Follow the rules and you'll be fine. Your check-ins and check-outs are more flexible (PTO) than the scrutiny you receive while actually working. Very fast-paced.
good,Fun but they work you hard... 55 hours when thing fall behind... pay was good.. didn’t have much of a social life working long hours 4 to 5 days week..
good,Work was always fun because of my coworkers. I didn't try to make much else out of it. If you really get involved I am sure Amazon has much more to offer than what I've experienced.
good,things could be better if we got paid a little more for the job that we do or if management had a bit more training on how to talk to talk to people when they ask a question or when they tell you to do something
good,"The people and managers were nice for the most part but the instability of the job was stressful, never knowing when you were going to be gotten rid of until a letter was handed to you. "
good,Amazon is a unique place to work. Lots of smart people all workign toward their team goal under an umbrella of company tenets. Sometime they work harmoniously and sometimes they conflict but there is always an opportunity to learn. Tough if you have a family with kids as the work hours can be long and unrelenting.
good,"Processing, packaging and shipping orders accurately"
good,"While my time here was part time, during my employment the hours provided for breaks were very limited and the amount of aims to hit within given shifts was very extereme."
good,You learn alot about  work culture people and unity of job across departments at amazon. Managment is very hands on. The hard part of the job is  making rate to keep the job. The enjoyable part of the job is  know your friend are there to help out during peak.
good,Amazon is an okay company for a start to get experience.  Advancement is slow and turn over rate is high.  Start pay is reasonable and benefits start day one.
good,"It is very hard to decide or to review the place , we are up to now seasonal drivers , very stressful job and dangerous too  , you face a lot of risky situations such as dogs out side the houses"
good,"We not allowed to talk with anyone unless you're a Manager or Team lead from your department, shifts hour was alright (10hours), i could handle it easy without problem but break time use to be to short 15 mins"
good,"Everything at Amazon is automated, it makes it difficult to address management about issues, there is a culture that pretty much exudes work hard and keep your head down or be better than anyone else. it is a competitive environment for those desiring to move forward and the repetitive tasks can be mentally draining. long hours and limited mobility make it somewhat difficult especially for some of the other people I worked with. Overall the benefits and rate of pay outweigh the negatives but do plan have low work-life balance you may end up with 3 days off but it is still pretty bad when it's spent just trying to recuperate"
good,"Schulung top"
good,If you can deal with the weather inside the warehouse being the sane temperature outside and the changes in the schedule periodically. The hourly pay is great you'll have to be ok with the poor management .
good,The best part of the job was the money and the benefits they had to offer. I also enjoyed the long 12hrs 4 times a week shift because of the three days off.
good,Je n'ai pas aimé la mentalité de l'entreprise sur le principe de la carotte au bout d'un fil pour faire avancer leur employer
good,"not for everyone"
good,The pay is decent for the amount of work required. Management makes you feel like a robot. You have a quota you must meet which constantly changes. Promotions are hard to achieve.
good,It is a good experience on how to manage with different with personalities and work ethics. A daily work day was the same as any warehouse with a lot of people and a really faced pace environment.
good,"Fast paced environment, really huge facility, i was always lost a few times when i started to work there, the people and H&R team helps a lot in trying to help you keep your job"
good,"Amazon is a great place to start in the workforce. However, the requirements the roles in the warehouse should be taken seriously as they're demanding."
good,"You are told you'll get a tour at orientation, but they will not Tour the workfloor because then you'll see what people leave the company for the most, 3-step ladders, speed where you have to pant to meet the rate requirement, daily/weekly writeups if after 2 weeks you havent met goal, after one month you are expected to reach maximum Per Hour Production rate while those who work at the dock have no quota demands, when work is slow you may unload and load trucks, in winter the truck is 32 degrees and in summer it's hot. They assign you a department and title but dont expect to only work in that department when other areas have load increase and need help, you may do 4 different jobs outside your assigned area in one day, you may Pack, sort or pick n pull products, load trucks, plastic wrap tall totes  and transport them, you may break-down tall boxes, take items on a jack-pallet to different workstations and walk back and forth loading and unloading pallets across 225,000 square feet. (Many have quit due to the first week causing excruciating pain on their feet) after that your feet adjust to it. Only 0ne elevator per floorr, (pray EMS gets to you in time if you get sick) the Plant in too huge for so few elevators, lavatories and just portable little water stations, (dont stop to drink too often, it will slow your production rate even though it's easy to dehydrate with all the shelving units on floor-bots blowing high-air in your face when your work is sent across the floor mechanically on 8 ft shelves. Prepare to be up and down, and up and down a 3 step ladder if you do SBC"
good,"I personally did enjoy working for Amazon, I was top performer for 3 months solid."
good,"Puts real hair on your chest. Metric driven people management. "
good,"I started at the Amazon in Dundalk, MD back in 2015, which is when it was first opening up for employees. There wasn't really an interview, they just asked me to bring in my birth certificate and like..another form of ID or something like that (it's been ~4 years now, so I can't remember well). They don't ask many questions, I think they just give you a quick rundown, ask you what schedule you'd prefer, and if they have that available, you're in luck (I asked for the Mon-Thurs 7am - 6pm schedule, got it). If they don't have the schedule you desire, they'll tell you what they do have available and it's up to you whether you want to take it or not. There is a drug test, so be prepared for that."
good,"You really need to stay on top of the scan rates. Also, you have to be able to build great pallets so that they do not fall over and injure anyone. The managers tend to keep an eye out for anyone not on task."
good,Amazon is a very fast paced environment. Long hours is expected of management and the associates are pushed to perform their job assignments. Promotions are difficult as an associate to reach a management position.
good,At Amazon you will either receive a good write up for quality and one for performance or it will be a bad write up. This determines your longevity and advancement.
good,"Long hours of repetitious work with absolutely no sitting. 15 minute breaks but takes 5 minutes each way just to walk to break area. Employees are expected to make productivity rates. Moved up from printer paper filler, to book chopper, moved up from there to lamination and eventually was working 2 lamination machines at once which was only feasible by Supervisors at the time. Despite my advancement, I was still the first person to be laid off out of 3 other employees I was hired same day with due to being given an ""unrated"" job (printer paper filler) initially by supervisors on my very first day..."
good,"A typical day  , depends where your  at , i worked problem solve/expedite  I fixed inventory issues and  catch mistakes  made by  employees and fixed them , Management was always changing and with those changes  the dynamic and atmosphere changed, which leads to a high stress job with long hours and little room for a home life  balance. Hardest part of the job was working 12 hour days sometimes 7 days a week. The best part was meeting and working with great people who i am still friends with today"
good,"Expect to work your butt off. people are fun to work with for the most part; however, there are many that do just enough to stay at rate so the rest of the team has to pick up slack"
good,Amazon is no doubt a big great company but working for them comes at a cost. There is no work life balance and they openly acknowledge that. It might not have helped to have worked in what was known as the worst fullfillment center in the state but it painted a picture of the company as a whole. High turnover and limited morale. Expectations are unrealistic.
good,Your basically working robots ! That job is very stressful I feel like it would be reasonable if they had 8 hours shifts. It’s a very physical job and they don’t care about age or disability if your not making rates you will get fired.
good,"same thing day in day out and not payed very well, not a good culture of work as even being in top 10% of department would always push for more and not tell you that your doing a great job"
good,typical day at work day is coming in to a team meeting to talk about the day before's performance stretch and get to work processing packages. the communication between workers and management is sub par if at all and you are thrown into the deep and expected to figure things out on your own. they sit in their corners and point and tell you to do this and that with little to not guidance.
good,"The problem with working for Amazon is that it feels like you’re at the bottom of the food chain, even when you’re on top of your game. Amazon is a very competitive and fast paced environment and is a short rope to grab onto if you’re seeking job security... unless you’re the best in the building, in which cases you are praised like a king, you get boot kissing attention from management, and you get all the prizes... since, you know, you’re at the top. Are you seeing a trend??? You’re forced to compete in these ridiculous conditions, and then are not compensated for the extra work they demand from you. UNETHICAL"
good,"Pay was good, but they do not care about employee, only that the work gets done. I would recommend this to someone who needs the money but definitely not a long term job."
good,"The first year was great, then they started to change a lot of rules and take advantage of the employees. They started to be really difficult to work with."
good,If you are going to work here be ready to work hard. From the time you clock in the the time you clock out there are not many breaks and it is very tiring
good,"journée qui commence par 1h30 de bouchon suivie de la livraison des colis pendant toute la journée  et se fini par 1h30 de bouchon."
good,"Company is driven by ""Goals"" that dont mean anything to the people that actually run the day to day operations. Work is physically challenging and repetative. Management typically outsourced and not in touch with physical demands. (Most managers cannot actually do what they expect of associates)."
good,"Great innovative company had fun there, but poor work life balance. Was not happy working 10 hour shifts and rotating shifts. I wish it had a more standard work schedule like FedEx or UPS M-F"
good,"You will work extremely hard throughout your shift and only be given two 30 min breaks every 3 hours. They will give you a hard time over bathroom breaks, manipulate your TOT, and constantly have you in a rat race to keep up your rate to avoid falling in the bottom 5%. Sr. Execs will also give us quotas that most people cannot physically including themselves, but then punish you for not being able to meet them, or tell you how you should have been able to make it instead of just admitting adjustments need to be made."
good,the warehouse and its management was to unorganized your shift wasnt really your shift they let you go like 2 hours in and worked you like slaves with little to no breaks
good,Pay is good for the hours worked. Most managers are nice and easy to get along with.  It is fast passed and you’re  on your feet the while time. Training is paid and there is opportunity to move up and advance.
good,If u can’t keep up with there numbers thy will let u go and not rehire u for a year later. So it’s very hard working with them. Since u have to have a set rate of 27 boxes per hour
good,"Fast paced work environment but the job is easily understood as far what is expected. Hard to make some goals based on area product is coming from vs. time allotted, however company is  good at motivating job task with incentives."
good,"Sprint planning every two weeks, then get the tasks, some implementation, some design work, start to work on them, then other times attending review meetings."
good,It really depends on which site you work because every site has a culture to where it benefits some and don’t benefit others. Certain Individuals can make the job harder.
good,"Bjrs je vous écris juste  déjà je suis content d avoir retrouver un emploi car je suis resté 3 ans sans emploi et maintenant je retrouve un poste et en plus un CDI."
good,Temp work was what we had been hired for during the holidays and come den we all were laid off! When we worked we had 1 break for 15 mins and then we had no other breaks.
good,Good company. Good pay. Excellent location. Great employees and relationships with fellow employees. But just poorly run. Area managers are disconnected from employees and have to constantly answer to ops management
good,Peak season the company is busy there are a lot of people. When peak season is over the company is very deserted and boring.The attendance policy is very strict and the manager are a little rude. The walking is a lot but not that bad. The hardest part is peak season. The benefit are good.Pay is nice to compared to other companies.
good,"At amazon you are given a task and you follow your task making sure you reach you benchmarks every hour or maintain a steady work base in your department."
good,Amazon does its best to make sure you enjoy being in the office.  As long as you get your work done you have a lot of freedom for lunch breaks and what hours you work.  The downside is there are metrics that track your production and pretty much everything you do.
good,"If you don't want to think, and don't mind hard work, it is perfect for you. You can advance, but it is not easy unless you come in as a manager already."
good,Amazon was a very fast paced company to work for. The experience I've acquired while working at Amazon will be beneficial for me for a liver and I'm grateful.
good,"Nothing different than other BPO industries. Work culture id good. Team managers and leads are friendly and they do hear you out. Work pressure is lot, no growth opportunities. You will end up doing same things here, nothing new to learn."
good,You have to be ready for a tough potentially burnout culture.  I would not change my experience in a rare culture.  I love the agility to change and improve the customer experience.
good,"Good place to work, pay is adequate, good benefits. You do have games to play for brake or lunch if you have the time. Depending on which area you might work, you might work really hard and/or really fast to keep up with quota."
good,moved to different jobs without proper training. Excited to join the team. I needed more explanation and training on new jobs. I did enjoy the co workers and felt the pay rate was fair
good,"As a stower you were required to add product to bins and had a minimum amount to do in a single shift and if you couldn't find a bin for it to fit in you walked many, many isles as you could only have a certain amount of items in a bin.  If you didnt meet your quota you were terminated."
good,"Worked at Amazon for almost 5 years. 6 months with the temp agency then hired on. The work varies from very easy days to back breaking hard days.There is little job security. One screw up could be the end of you regardless of your seniority or record. Managers pop out from college out of nowhere and all of sudden they are your boss. 3 months later they transfer and the cycle continues. Leadership is easily the worst part of the job. PAs scanning you for being late coming back to late when it takes 5 minutes going to and back from break in a large crowd. If you can tolerate the incompetent leadership, it's a good job."
good,"Not too many complaints about the job. Decent pay, good benefits. Just make sure you aren't injured either on the job or away from the job. This FMLA team is so unorganized it's ridiculous. They ask you to complete documents, and then they ask for more. They ask you to send your doctor an Attending Physician Statement, but they never send one for you to give to your doctor, which delays your leave of absence, and can potentially result in them denying your leave. If you miss more than enough days, you get more unexcused absences than your time off can cover. After that, they throw you away like garbage. Otherwise, not a bad job."
good,"-high paced enviornment"
good,"Working at Amazon Is A Challenge everyday But I like A Challenge more the less I like how you stay Busy at Amazon And the Benefits And Pay is Awesome, Not to Mention I had some Wonderful Co Workers"
good,Amazon is not or everyone. If you are looking for easy money this is not the company for you. You really do walk 14 miles a day as a picker. The other jobs you must stand for 10 hours a day.
good,"The work can be heavy depending on volume and starting pay is now at $15 an hour but you’re restricted to 20hrs a week and cannot get more hours unless it’s the holidays. "
good,The work is intense your always busy. Benefits are great. Programs like job and resume training are available.  Your ability to move up depends on both your skills as a worker and your connection to your area manager. More of the Latter.
good,"Stretches for 5 minutes before work, some managers are very nice, few are the ones that think they are boss and dont act like leaders. If any medical issues this job will not work for you it is very active job and requires long standing periods, great if your fit and live a very very active lifestyle."
good,You work long hours on your feet with no chance to sit down except for the two 15 min breaks and the 30 min lunch. You have to work at a very fast pace to meet the expected quotas.
good,The job it's self wasn't bad it was the management. They were so lazy. They did nothing all day but talk to other associates. Then they would get on you for rate. There was such hypocrisy.
good,cool place to work But the pay was will not allow you to sufficiently provide.................................................................................Invest into the employees will make this company stronger!
good,"it is a very busy and fast workplace, with plenty of challenges, work conditions was acceptable, some of the staff was very helpful, while some was not."
good,"The job itself is really repetitive same thing everyday and they constantly are finding ways for you to work harder for the same pay, like they decided that they they only want you to pick by yourself this includes items that weight over 150 pounds because they can save a few bucks by giving vto which is time off with out pay people take it because they are so exhausted from working on the dock for twelve hours. The managers seem to care about you but they only care about bottom line money they care if their rate isn’t good so they send people home to make their bonus. Now that the busy season is over they don’t care and are looking fire people.  And they just raised the starting rate but they away any raises up until 18 months and they took away any insentive to come to work by taking away vcp and rsu stock options"
good,"Starting out, the job is extremely straightforward.  You find your name on one of the monitors placed throughout the building to find what lane in which you'd be working, before grabbing your scanner.   On the line, you scan boxes that come down and place them on the corresponding palette.  "
good,"Fast paced enviorment."
good,"Interesting , Yet Challenging Work , However Though You Work Steadily , Hourly .   Your Ability To Keep The Same Pace Is Based On The Items Provided For You .   The Idea Of Keeping Your Numbers Up & Increasing Can Become A No Way Possible , Making The Position Stressful , And Their Rating System Is Clearly A Set-Up For Failure .   Their Computers Dont Allow You To Correct Your Minor Error , Or They Just Dont Train You On That Procedure .   Some People Work Very Fast Once They Gain Their Momentum , Then Suddenly All The Robot Shelves (Pods) Are Too Full , Have NO Space To Place The Large Size Items You Need To Insert Quickly To Keep Your Numbers Up  , So You're Stuck , Can't Unload Your Stock /Items , Your Numbers Immediately  Start Dropping , With No Way To Recover Them .   This Was A Big Issue Many Dealt With And Informed Managers Of It .   Once Again That Is A Clear , SET UP FOR FAILURE , So Unfair .

good,"rates always increasing cause much stress and poor employee moral. managers only care about productivity not the individual person. if you underperform once you get a write up no matter the situation. no phones allowed so if there is an emergency and you receive a phone call at security it will take an hour for them to reach, if they reach you at all."
good,"When I first started here and got used to the job I enjoyed it but as time went on I grew to hate it."
good,"I've been there since August 2017, it's a fun place to work If you can tolerate the extreme physicality aspects of it, you're at liberty to come in and leave as you wish, giving management at least a hour notice, if you must leave early but, you MUST management you time wisely and Not exceed your given UPT, (un paid time) or you're terminate without question. You get Vacation time, Personal Time (paid) & UPT, with UPT having the most hours at 20 hrs quarterly, 80 for the year. The management teams are for the most part Very respectful, fair & easy to talk to, because That Is one thing that Is Enforced, RESPECT towards one another, from management, HR, Security, etc... I Love THAT about them! If the work wasn't so physically demanding, I would not attempt to leave. I keep saying ""I'm leaving"" yet, I keep showing up. :) The place grows on you... I Really love what I do, it's just too hard of work for 10 hours..."
good,Amazon is a good place to work at unless you are the graveyard shift. There has been times where I was told not to come into work for days at a time. There was one pay period where I did not even get a check due to them not letting me work. They need to find something for their night shift to do if there is noting to count.
good,"good job not a great career, management are just robots cant make decisions  upper mngmnt left  han dont know what right hand is doing"
good,Clearing jammed lines on the conveyor before having to shut down the whole system. Scanning and paletizing the merchandise to the correct shipping palettes. Loading and unloading trucks with boxes weighing 10 to 60lbs.
good,Amazon was a great experience also hard labor but really good pay the hours were really long but the day went fast because you stayed busy. the managers were very strict but overall the job taught me a lot.
good,"Each day at amazon was different, VERY FAST PACED, This was a very compitative environment and at sometimes very stressful. everyday was a race to reach rate."
good,Pour moi personnellement je n'ai pas aimé. Pour des jeunes en début d'expérience c'est bien pour eux<;
good,"Travail en intérim pendant quelques mois, pas d'avis particulier"
good,"An sich ein Ordentliches Unternehme."
good,"I've been at Amazon going on 7 months. The pay is great however my job position is a stower. It's hard to stay in 1 spot for 12 hours and doing the something over and over again., If you like staying one 1 spot then hey, this job would be great for you. My advice is that it my job would be allot easier if they would have you moving around in different areas instead of staying in 1 spot. Also, the give you random pallets to work with and they expect you to do so many items for example (260 ) done with in an hour but give you 2 pallets and expect to have 100 %. If your below 96% they will write you up.  This job was not what I expected and for people who are looking for a job be sure that you ask the questions during the orientation because the grass isn't always greener on the other side even if the PAY is &17.50 hr and you leave your other job for one that pays more! Word of Advice!!  Ask all kinds of questions during the short interview they have you go through and during the orientation."
good,Its a fast pace environment u cant stop it's better for a younger person I enjoy the fast pace it's a job for now it eats the Bill's but ur not treated that well
good,"Treat you as a number, not a person. Would only work there for the benefits received. The pay is decent. The schedule is constantly changing especially around any holidays."
good,"Management just holds a title. They have newly hired training ambassadors to do all the Dirty Work."
good,"Was hot, not much room to advance, what else do i need to say other then the fact that I would not ever work there again if I didnt have to. So there and take that"
good,I haven't work there in year when I tired to go back because I was seasonal they give me the run a round. having me go back in forth to the workhouse so I just gave up on trying to go back there.
good,"Stressful, a lot of patience, favoritism is major there,  hateful people,"
good,"On a d'abord droit à 2semaines de nursing(formation, apprentissage) avec 90 points maximum. Après, ça double et les points augmentent sans arrêt et lorsque tu t'habitue au secteur, on te change sans prévenir avec le même nombre de colis à livrer....."
good,"Good compensation. Too many cooks in the kitchen. Difficult to navigate. The culture promotes people with very strong characters, whom are difficult to work with. Horrible work life balance."
good,I did not like working at Amazon because it was very physically demanding and boring. It was not a very rewarding job experience. I wouldn't recommend it unless you need money fast
good,"I like the culture that everyone is working hard and do better job. Also, react very quickly to any issues. I did not like their metrics, which making you feel like working at a factory,"
good,"From the beginning this company seemed promising - the work was interesting, there was a clear goal and there were projects to solve throughout the process. There were new challenges brought on, and they engaged my team to try to provide a high quality of work. However management is overall a disappointment."
good,Most workers like myself are seasonal and you’ll be lucky to become a full time employee. Work from home was the position but everything was fast paced and their performance chart was ridiculous
good,very good place to be and excellent people. Really go getting and open to new things. gives opportunity to work at the centre of the cloud phenomenon.
good,"They don't really care about the employees, if they feel the need to they will fire you on the spot if you are doing something you feel is harmless but they don't approve of. You are working non-stop for 10 hours with two 15 min. breaks and one 30 min. break. Unrealistic expectations for an average person. Easily written up, two write up results in a final then termination. Easy work but when adding the productivity and quality standards along with having to maintain a speed rate that they're constantly on your back about the job become stressful and annoying. If you don't mind worrying about your job every day and the threat of possibly losing it often then this job could be for you. Not allowed to have your phone on the production floor so your not allowed to listen to music which means its just you driving around the warehouse for 10 hours in complete silence doing the same things over and over again."
good,Good experience with this organization and learned more about the customer satisfaction and how to help and clear the customers needs and problems. And had very good funny environment with surrounding colleagues enjoyed working as an executive.
good,"Amazon est une entreprise qui permet a ceux qui sont motivés de pouvoir avoir un emploi. "
good,"Great for a part time job over the holidays to earn extra money.  Nice way to stay in shape and keep moving around during the cold days of winter.  Draw backs include no advancement in a significant way, small shifts, and few communication outlets."
good,"Seasonal sortation job during Pre-Christmas season. They advertise these positions with vague promises of becoming permanent, and this is encouraged and pushed by floor managers: if you are still there when the season ends, they'll take you on permanently.  Went home from my morning shift a week after the season ended, to discover someone from Amazon called and refused to leave a message or call-back. They called again while I was home, from a generic call center somewhere outside the USA, to inform me that my position was ended and I didn't have to go to work my next shift. I was among dozens who were dropped, they only kept a few of their seasonal people."
good,"Potentially long hours, especially during the holiday season. Job duties were mundane and boring at first, but there are plenty of opportunities to learn new roles, such as problem solving, process guide, etc. that give you a lot more interesting things to do. There are two types of jobs as a tier one. They have direct roles, and indirect roles. In a direct role you have a rate that you have to hit every hour, and you can get a write up if you don't meet your productivity goal. However, with indirect roles, you get 'labor tracked', where you don't have any specific numeric goal that you have to meet, but typically the jobs are actually more challenging and difficult. I found that trying to maximize the amount of time you were staffed in an indirect role greatly improved my experience working at Amazon. I probably would have left a lot sooner if I had to work in direct path every day. That said its probably best to try to get promoted as soon as possible, as the wage step plan caps after 3 years, and you make the same as a new hire until after 2 years on the job. Overall, I think its a good place to work if you need the money, and don't care about having the most fulfilling of jobs, but if you're looking for something engaging, challenging and exciting, this job definitely isn't for you."
good,"A fast-paced job with very little downtime, Amazon was too stressful especially since it didn't pay enough to live on. There were also few benefits and little chance of advancement."
good,"fast paced, you get in shape, must meet time allotment requirements.  Friendly environment, but  If you don't have another person at home that you trust, you better not have any kind of emergency or have anything you need to do because you cannot take off time over your allotted days."
good,"Not a bad place to work but not good either."
good,Amazon puts too much stress on their employees to keep up with production. Even when there are opticles in your way such as slow or no work. It is a good company to work for keep good attendance.
good,Worked for SOS (third party who has contract with amazon) and they were great. Great management and very lenient. The people who actually work for Amazon are unfriendly and rude. They think they are better than you.
good,"To begin with it is not tough but after some months there you will get burned out from constant fast walking etc. Frantic treasure hunts through 100's of small items, only 30 seconds or you lose. Amazon has little to no staff loyalty, always getting fresh legs in the door and any slightly worn out soles get kicked out without questions."
good,"Amazon is an extreme culture highlighted by a rapidly evolving environment at all times. Your manager, coworkers, desk location, job function, support teams, tools, and goals are in a consistent state of revision. The corporate environment clearly works best for cut throat, A-type personalities with a knack for self promotion and political savvy. If you are shrewd enough to move up the ranks you will encounter an increasingly fierce competitive nature with your similarly leveled co-workers. One ill timed slip up or manager rotation could derail your previous progress, or worse yet send you down a path towards exile from Amazon altogether. Aligning yourself with the right people, getting on the highest visibility projects, and timely rotations before things go wrong are all hallmarks of success here. The projects are cool, the people are smart, the compensation is more than fair...but don't blink or else you'll be out of place and passed up. As a current 2x promoted people manager I don't find developing direct reports or cultivating a positive workplace environment as a particularly valued skill by management (until you are at a high rank in the company - L8). Competing priorities between job functions and the desire of everyone to push their own agenda forward can lead to constructive innovation, but just as often leads to less desirable outcomes. My advice; treat this place as a 2-4 year education, be ready to hustle with little help, and do it when you don't have a family."
good,"All these ""best place to work"" polls must be done in Seattle, most of the people I know within Amazon Logistics (specifically) are frustrated with advancement, decision-making, prospects, etc."
good,"The job was ok I had bad experience with a manager. The employees are usually nice the environment is loud but tolerable , it’s a safe environment with constant security patrols."
good,"The job in itself isn't terrible, but it is very hard on your body and you are expected to meet unrealistic goals. Someone once described it as ""soul-crushing"" and I can definitely cosign that. The breaks are too short, also."
good,"Normal, high turnover, warehouse/delivery job. Management is sloppy, HR is racist they don't do holiday pay or overtime and they expect soldiers to work on memorial day."
good,Overall though fast paced. I loved working there! My managers were cool and understanding. Worked with a diverse population made it fun! That matters alot with workplace
good,"I tried it and didn't like it!  "
good,"I enjoyed working at amazon for a couple months but you slowly find that you are not valued and will be fired very quickly if you don't make rate. The pay and time off was great. Management was not the best, they only came to you when you were in trouble. My manager barley knew who I was."
good,"You're constantly moving, you are monitored with how much work you do.  Management showed that they cared about your well being, you worked alone.  Overall if you want to have no home life, this is the place for you.  Plus side they offered plenty of overtime."
good,"I've only been here for about a month or so, and I am honestly already debating if it is worth it. The job has four, 10 hour days with no option for PT positions unless you are a student at my location, or can transfer to another location somewhere else. They harp on you about your rate (how many boxes you do in an hour, plus your end week %) but as a new hire you aren't told anything about it beyond that it doesn't matter the first 4 weeks, when it clearly does. And even if you do make your rate, depending on if they make you come in for mandatory OT your rate could fall by as much as 1-2% per hour. So if you are on a bad lane that isn't getting the right products, your numbers suffer. Not to mention people hoard the items they know will give them a higher rate at the front, so if you are in the back end you won't get anything and will have to work 2x as hard when you switch...and thats IF you can convince the person who is in your next spot to move. Training is awful, nothing that you actually need to know is explained. You have to rely on the older employees to tell you how to get it done, but nothing is ever consistent as everyone has different ways to do it. They are hypocritical as they will get you for things they know everyone does, because, again, it is all about the numbers. They will also try and get you for not scanning items or doing what you need to do, but sometimes it can't be helped if the truck is empty or the line breaks down. Breaks and lunch  are laughable. 15 minutes that gets cut down to 10 because of how long it takes to walk to the lunch room, and 30"
good,"Ok place to work, but will run you into the ground, and sweep you under the rug, for the next person. "
good,I was pregnant mostly my entire time at amazon but I’ve done warehouse work all my life so it was fine for me. I came in with a few of my cousins and let’s just say they are younger then me by like five years and they quit. I stayed until I went into labor again the work isn’t hard but the breaks arent anything not real breaks at allby the time u get to ur locker car or whatever it took u almost ten minutes from your station to ur locker to do that u only get one 30 minute break and a 15 break for ten hours on your feet that’s not enough so now u gotta rush ur break and to eat so basically u don’t have the proper time to actually enjoy ur break n let ur feet rest me n some people wouldn’t even leave out station we go get some ice n a soda n sit right there because by the time u did all that n take seat break is over if they could work on that it would be a better a place to work.
good,"I have worked for temp agencies during my time at Amazon, and at various warehouses. Most of the jobs are fairly rudimentary and somewhat monotonous."
good,It depends on who you are and the direction you want to take. Amazon have great ways to advance quickly. Work hard do your part and EXCEL! GO FOR IT!!!
good,it was a job. it ended as needed. i learned that warehousing items is important if you have the right computer program for locating said item. and a  good hr team to find and keep up with the workers.
good,"Excellent $15.00 per hour wage. Opportunity to work extra hours during Peak season. Cut throat managers. Not enough hours to live off. Good part time job, four, 4 hour shift minimum."
good,"At Amazon, you either sink or swim. Expect minimal direction and a lot of freedom to make decisions (at any level). As long as you can support your ""calls"" with linking it to directly benefiting the customer (whoever that may be in your position), you should be fine. Making mistakes is ok, too. Just need to learn from them."
good,This company will fire you for any reason they can come up with if they feel like it. No write up or warning. Just fired. I worked there for 3 years and I received no respect.
good,The hardest part of the job was working in the extreme heat.  The center was not air conditioned and was like an oven.  I worked with some cool people that tried to make the job as fun as possible
good,"It taught me the importance of a teamplayer."
good,"La sicurezza e condizione a lavoro sono perfette, a quanto pare il contratto di lavoro sono brevi"
good,"I loved working at Amazon very fast pace environment. I was trained every area from diverting, water spider, Sorting and palletizing and so on. they were very good at training you and each area and gave you an ample amount of time to become proficient in job duties."
good,"Working at amazon was fun the first week. but after a while it’s constant TEDIOUS work. i was a stower and eventually, after constant asking a waterspider but that’s as far as i got. i love to learn new things and show people what i’m capable of but with this job they didn’t seem much interested. "
good,"Days are usually the same just something different will go wrong which you need to react to.  Dealing with upper managers who don't understand what he/she is doing and won't take advice, but some do.  Stressful process to get promoted because you do everything and then some what is asked of you and still get passed by."
good,"Working at Amazon, at least at the lower rungs, is no cake walk. Despite the fact it is effectively being able to read simple letters on boxes and bags, and put them in the proper place it was still quite hectic and I think I know why. First of all, the number of employees is lacking most of the time, work loads are rather large. Secondly, there are little issues, such as, with the two 15 minute breaks for a typical 8 hour day, part of that 15 minutes is used up simply travelling to the break room, which depending on your station, depends on if you have nearly your full break time, or about 5 minutes before you have to leave just to get back to your station once more, before you get written up for being Late, despite being on the other end of the warehouse. Management needs to be on the same page about situations and protocol more often as well, too many times, we have 2 people in charge, giving conflicting information."
good,"I enjoyed working here for years after a while  you realize you are just a number and can be replaced easily. They do not care what you have done for the company,."
good,You work hard and usually over what you are scheduled to. The management is poor as are the working conditions. If you work hard you are taken advantage of and pushed beyond normal working conditions.
good,"A typical day consisted of clocking in and going straight to the start up areas where they would brief you. Then you would get straight to work and work continuously for about 3 hours until your first 15 minute break. Then as soon as your 15 minute break is over you had to be at your station working for three more hours all the way up to your 30 minute lunch. The 30 minute break was really meant for like bathroom breaks because if you are to take time out of work for anything else you get time off task. This was possibly the most frustrating thing, the 30 minute break that gave you barely anytime to relax. But after the break would end you'd go to start up once more where you could talk to manager or they would just motivate you and tell you to keep your top speed up for the last 5 hours of your shift. As for the rest of the shift its the same as the first half but the managers would really get on you about slowing down even though they know your tired and exhausted from working hard."
good,Average place to work at and being accurate is important. A lot of walking is done there so you will stay in shape. You learn how to build pallets properly and with help move larger and heavy packages. Team lift. You work with all shapes and sizes and ages of people.
good,it typically starts very early and it can last from 10 to 12 hr shift. you basically have to be standing 90% of that time and meet certain goals. I think that the management wasn't very comprehending about the effort their employees put in.
good,"A typical day at work was demanding from clock in until clock out. I did get the opportunity to learn different positions, therefore it did not become monotinous. I learned how to receive, stow, problem solve, sherlock, ambassador, and process guide. There were a lot of days that I may have had to do more than one of those positions at the same time. It was a stressful job and very physically demanding. The hardest part of the job was the mental stress and the rate of productivity that was expected hourly. The most enjoyable part of the job was definately the people that I had the pleasure of working with. Compared to some other jobs I have worked, the other associates, management, and other department associates were some of the best people that I have ever had the pleasure of not only calling my co-workers but many of them I could call my friends."
good,"You learn as you go every day. Everyone around you is there to both help you do better and try to outdo your skills. The managers emphasize safety and speed of work. Advancement is a complex process, and you must excel at all jobs in the warehouse."
good,"Fast past, being able to get extra hours before others beat you to the hours, good work place culture, the hardest part of the job is not knowing if your going to be able to work your whole full shift until you get to work an they tell you your only going to work for three hours or two. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that your getting paid and the work is not hard labor."
good,"Good pay a lot of hours. 4 days a week 10 hour shifts. Worked at the Coalville warehouse. Pay at that time was about £9+ an hour for night shifts. Fortunately, for newcomers to pay has now risen to £11+ an hour."
good,"If you want to make money work at Amazon for the low cost of your soul. "
good,The environment was very stressful and the management lacked overall capabilities to manage anyone. They just let anyone become a manager. Not a good place to work overall.
good,"Poor management from all managers."
good,"Lovely work environment but metamessages are often portrait within  management. It could be easy to get thrown under the bus if one is not careful. Love the work environment and compensation. The hours, schedule or employees finances are not handled by management but by HR which is a big plus. The flow in management varies from the department to department. Some are a dream come true while others are questionable."
good,"Very long hours but good chances to progress, good all round training packages, good rates of pay. Chance for overtime if required. Health & Safety and First aid training package. Flexible working patterns if required."
good,"I work for Amazon Prime Shopper and have learned for to do shipping begs, but not many hours poor management asking to get hours either you won't get the problem solved or keep trying laid back job can be festering  because you can't find what the customer order. but shopping can be fun."
good,"interesting company. not very structured and organized. growing too fast, too little face to face time with management and colleagues"
good,"A typical day was okay, depending on who was your manager. I learn how to properly train employees, how to fix troubled shipments, and I learned how to open a new building. Management was good. The workplace culture was good. The hardest part of the job was the hours. The enjoyable part of the job was going out of state to open a new building."
good,"job made no since how all positions started off at the same pay even advancements with more responsibilities didn’t come with more pay, it’s a money hungry company with  minimalist pay just enough to keep people content. The company dropped an entire 3rd shift a day after Christmas a month before seasonal job was supposed to end, mind you the company broke selling records outselling Walmart"
good,A typical day at work starts with stand up and some pointless stretching. Then you get your assignment for the day/night with will 100% of the time change at some point.
good,"Easy job but not worth 10 hours every day. "
good,"As a season job it's great. You go in, do your job, get paid."
good,"Perfect job if it's your 2nd job and you need A LITTLE extra money. I say that because if you come there after working another job, that's the only way you can be happy on the days you  work less than a full shift (which is too often.)They raising the minimum wage but they don't give raises. Unless you are a manager, there is no advancement. Good people, good ideas, good training but they just don't pay enough/ have enough hours. As much money as I think they make/ save I think they should invest in their employees. They would probably be up there with Google if they did."
good,"it wasnt a bad place to work. there are several job positions one can get inside amazon, the stow ann pickers positions require high productivity an for stowers its hard to get the numbers they expect when you cant find room in the boxs to store the clothing."
good,amazon fresh was a fast paced and cut throat job you never knew if what was going on and could be fired at any time. there are plenty of good people there but are hindered buy the fact that you never know what is going on till start of shift
good,"great place to work for a first time job, and to possibly build a career out of, they provided paid schooling after you have been there for 2 years, great place"
good,"Très bonne entreprise , des responsables agréable l'ambiance aussi "
good,"i work nights. i learned how to sorts, labelling and how to work in a team the hard part is it""s very physical labor intense and your assignment never rotate."
good,Overall satisfied but the sudden dismissal was not nice. Could have informed me on a month before time to enable me plan my next move. Was difficult to cope during my working period as PMP agents made it more frustrating
good,go to work everyday and answr the phone calls that come in stock. The culture is fun and nice but you was required to work all holidays and they don't care what you have going on.
good,"The workplace was very conducive for the employees. You were given a locker, work gloves and a safety vest."
good,"A typical day at Amazon consisted of 2 and half intervals of straight work before your first break that is only 15 minutes long. The next 2 and a half hours feel like the longest and your lunch break is only 30 minutes long. I know warehouse jobs are tough but if you ask me the 1 hour of combined break in 10 hour shift is a bit rough. I'd much prefer an hour lunch and skip past the 15 minute breaks that aren't long enough to even get from your mod to a break room before you're back at work for another 2 hours. That being said they had some amazing rewards for people who didn't use their paid time off, and the benefits they offered where top notch."
good,"Amazon's goal is to be the most customer-centric company on the planet.  "
good,"Working at Amazon, there really is no such thing as typical. Delivery trucks can arrive late or early. You never know what your day will be until you are clocked in and the area manager tells you about the day."
good,"Amazon will train you in everything. And they will hire you with absolutely no experience. But once you are trained, you are expected to perform as if you have been doing the job for years. The benefits are awesome but you have to make your self know to management or HR if you want to advance in the company."
good,"You'll sweat and stink every day there, making is rate king. You will be written up for not making rate. They try to be a pep rally kind of upbeat atmosphere but the physical demands will eventually get to you. Nagged to get back from breaks after every break, and very long walks to the bathroom if you need to use it which will affect your rate Ok first job or if you desperately need one but kind of treated like a child in their culture. The only thing that makes the job bearable is the 3 day weekends and even that catches up with you eventually. No a job for everyone."
good,job is very stressful they are always on your back about something even going to the bathroom. you have to have a certain rate no matter if your sick or not feeling good they don't care they give you a certain amount of time if you don't have any time to leave they wont excuse it and if your time goes in the negatives then you are fired.
good,"Not that bad of a place to work.  In all positions I know of your on some type of ""rate"" system.  Meaning keep up or there'll let you know or your out."
good,"Typical work day consists of 3-5 hours and 8-12 miles of walking within that time. You can choose to work ""doubles"" which means 6-10 hours a day and 15-25 miles. Management varies. You're treated like a child until you've worked there long enough to earn their respect. They train you on whatever you want, but it's all just more responsibility and stress, yet the same pay."
good,"The typical day at work was me showing up for 10 hours to do a repetitive task. While the work wasn't difficult I did have some issues with the secular they gave me. They set one of my mandatory overtime days to Sundays, as fair as I am aware I informed them I wasn't available that day. They also refused to change it after informing them that I go to church on Sundays, in addition to getting a letter written by my pastor verifying that I do so. Their reason was ""I wasn't a part of the service."" when I inquired the HR why my request was rejected. Also you will want to bring your check book with you to orientation. I didn't and it took me a mouth for me to access my first paycheck via an ADP pre-paid Visa Card, they are the only company that I have ever worked for that do not mail out live checks I would hope they change that. Another negative aspect of working at amazon from October - January you will be working 50 hour weeks, unless you use PTO, UTO, or Sick time to get out of it."
good,"..as it was a new facility, and supposedly we had set company records during the holiday season, it just wasn't enough, it was only about setting more records.."
good,"Too much preferential treatment in this workplace, the Supervisors only see what they want to see, very disrespectful to people they don't  like.Most associates can never do enough or work fast enough to earn their respect."
good,"It can be highly stressful trying to meet the ever increasing quotas that seem to be set arbitrarily by management. Not a very good work/life ratio. However, they offer benefits starting the first day. If that's what you're looking for, then this is a decent place to work. They offer VTO and PTO benefits as well. There are some good bonuses for working here that are supposed to make up for the lower than area average pay."
good,"Great company, work culture could use work must invest great amounts of time to advance but advancement very possible for management type persons who start at entry level."
good,"I'm very grateful for all I learned and all the opportunities I had at Amazon, but I still find it the strangest mixed bag of a place I've ever worked for.  In some respects it's highly efficient, state-of-the-art, convenient, customer-friendly, etc.; in others, it's sheer farce and chaos (beneath a thin veneer).  For example, job advancement can be weirdly difficult, and this has been not just my experience but also that of many people I worked with.  Overall, Amazon tries to be decent (for instance, with benefits and flexibility) while remaining thrifty (as with compensation and work load)."
good,"Mi sono trovata molto bene. C'è un ambiente lavorativo positivo ed incoraggiante."
good,Do you need a job right now? They will hire you. Will you stay at this job? Most likely not. From my experience 30% quit within the first 2 days. Then in a week another 30%. In two weeks maybe another 20 to 30% will leave. The rest will leave in time. This was my experience at least. I had a great manager until he moved up and he was replaced with someone inadequate and I left due to stress they gave me.
good,"The job is consistent and not that taxing as long as you are willing to follow orders. Some of the managers were nice, but others clearly see you as another cog in the machine."
good,The job itself wasn't too bad. Depending on what job and department you were in. Management is mostly people fresh out of college that have no real people or life skills and don't know how to handle a lot of employee concerns. Working 10 hour shifts can be hard especially when working overtime.
good,"My opinion is that as an employee of Amazon, I am not paid enough for the work that I do. I am in the top 10 of the warehouse which has 5000 workers and my pay does not show that one bit. I also would like to move up in the company, not going to happen."
good,"In the Maintenance Technician world, It is hard to move up after Tech III (Level 4) because of very few ""Blue Badge"" positions available.  We keep hearing that will increase, but we shall see.  I think an increase in these type of facilities and more options for techs to travel in America and abroad to take equal or greater roles in the Maintenance Tech space would vastly improve growth and outlook on maintenance, corrective and preventative, as a whole."
good,"Work place is good, sometimes it depends on manager how he or she carried out day to day activities. However need to create better job security and need career path"
good,Being that Amazon is the number 1 you would think the pay is great. Not so much..long hours and little pay. Benefits package is awesome which starts on day one so that's good. Workplace culture is cool. The hardest part is the long hours especially when it's not peak season. Management could be better.
good,I was only seasonal and it was pretty chaotic threw most of the season but most people where nice and friendly i did not feel like they explain your job very well. They would have classes and get u safety certified and all the other needed requirments for what you where hired for but once those  first three days over classes are over i felt like i was just thrown into the chaotic mix where it was busy and being new didnt know all the in and out of what or how or where or when i was suppose to do.
good,"Positive experience, good employees, great exercise, good managment, flexible hours, great for students, quick paced, clean warehouse, simple HR process to be hired."
good,"I learned a heck of a lot at Amazon about software engineering at scale, However the frenetic pace can wear you down, particularity if you have other non-work commitments like family. The politics and management adeptness can vary from team to team so beware."
good,Stress and non consistent workweeks with an awfull management team that can never keep work moving in anything considered a fast pace and somehow it is alowies the fault of the employees
good,no benifits pay was too low long hours and the manager were lazy people getting the real money and they spoke of it that was a bad reflection on poor management
good,"The job is very hard on your feet. People and staff there are really nice though. The pay is good as well. Long eleven hour shifts, can be difficult. Would recommend if having a choice to become a Reach truck driver as its less pain on your feet."
good,"Amazon did not place me in a position based on experience, but on what they needed.  Job was stressful with unrealistic expectations. Pay was ok, vacation and sick time based on hours worked - not a set amount."
good,A few managers are amazing. The rest is terrible. Entry level associates are treated terrible. Tier 3 associates think they're managers. They complain about breaks. Benefits are amazing. Time off is good. Just don't burn through it. Stock is the best thing.
good,"The pay is a little above minimum wage, varying depending on location, shift, and position. Hours can vary from 24-40+ a week and many shifts available including days and overnights, so you can probably find something good for you. I work an overnight weekend shift, which includes a dollar/hr differential on top of the base pay, 24-28 hrs a week. The work load is often really heavy and they sometimes expect too much out of you, especially at my location, DLA7. The leadership here is also a joke. Mostly just kids who show up to screw around with their friends and have no clue what their doing."
good,You must make rant and if rant not made you are fired. amazon wants there employees to be at there stations at all time because if your not you will get “tot” which mean time of task and you can get fired for that too. Also amazon is all about safety.
good,they spend a lot of time and money making changes and forget about the ones who do all the work. Our company picnic was in the parking lot at the warehouse.
good,"Ever changing days a work and anything can change instantly.  Some days are good and some are bad, like with most jobs.  The management team here seem to only care out their performance rather than seeing their team be properly trained and taken care of."
good,Awesome benefits but pay is too low in any position compared to other companies. Your spouse MUST work or you will have to have a second job to get ahead.
good,"6/10 rating, typical work day was coming in and finding what position you are assigned to. everyday you're doing something different so you don't get stuck doing one thing."
good,Working at Amazon there is a lot of work to be done it's a cool place to work you stay busy it's always something to do. They train really good they make sure you understand and get the job before you finish training.
good,"Mi sono trovata bene."
good,This job was performed near hazardous machinery at times. There are lots of heavy objects stored above on racks. There is also lots of cross traffic. Lots of pinch points too. Office employs are subject to that environment too at times.
good,Amazon is a very chill culture with no work life balance. I wanted to relocate to Seattle WA from Austin TX since my kids and Fiance are here and I had no help. which is making me look for better opportunities
good,"poor work life balance"
good,"Job function was very physically exhausting, demands of unreasonable production rates, many times we were told that we would receive different tools and methods to better accomodate us and make our job safer and easier and they did not deliver on their word. To even take a water break or use the bathroom would drastically drop your work rate to unacceptable levels. I have done roofing, construction and asphalt paving and I have never had an experience with such unrealistic expectations as Amazon. And when I injured my wrist and also my foot on seperate occassions working there, I never received any compensation or disability."
good,Get to work on good projects depending on team but work pressure is a lot. Culture gives ownership end to end for projects. Things move fast to production which is good.
good,"They start out slow and then they demand you increase your production ,whether picking, packing, or counting. Eventually if you don’t meet their excessive demands of production which not many make , eventually they use evaluations to rate you. If you can’t meet unrealistic expectation then you either quit or get fired."
good,It’s an awesome knjon would recommend if you needed an temporary job ASAP. I personally wouldn’t view as a long term job unless you really enjoy the warehouse works
good,"Job is fast pace, rates are ridiculous high that’s why they have a turn over rate. I worked in 2 different departments, at first I was in pack which was 75 boxes a hour. Then I moved to stow and that’s when it got ridiculous, the rate was 362 a hour! Who in their right mind can move that fast! The worst part is the management, you will get wrote up and very likely to termination if you don’t meet rate but management can’t meet rate their self, funny right? When we need the extra help they have to log into a station and help, this happen in both departments I was in, my manager in single pack rate was like 54 and my manager in stow was like 120."
good,"N/A . Summary"
good,"It was hard to balance,family,life,and school working 10 or 12+hours a day especially during holiday time people were doing 60+ hours. You work thanksgiving and the day before Christmas day after and on New Years Eve and Day."
good,"Fast paced with little time to relax and few breaks.  Tiring and tedious work on the line. Trucks are fast paced and brutal if you have to work on them. Managers are friendly, but worry more about production than personal well being."
good,Productive workplace with decent salary could use better management who has a clear view of what needs to happen... needs a better rate percentage quota
good,"Hard work. Very repetitious and boring. I ended up getting tendonitis and the only way to get help for it was to go to an assessment for workers comp which is not what I was trying to do, the doctor that checked me out said it was from repetitive stress and that I could go back to work, which basically told Amazon I wasn't injured. However the repetitive stress just made things worse. Anyway aside form that, I did not enjoy the job at all. Warehouse jobs are not for everybody."
good,"Amazon is a 2 sided coin. On the one hand, some managers are great people and really care and understand that you are killing yourself to help them succeed. On the other hand, some managers could care less."
good,"If you are trying to advance your career, you will find it difficult.  Amazon only promotes those who can write the best 6 pagers, and who work 12 hour days.  It pays incredibly well, but you pay the price in dealing with sometimes difficult leadership.  "
good,"They treat you like a robot. No consideration is given to the amount of time. They constantly offer unpaid time off, that actually hurts your production rates for the week."
good,Amazon est une entreprise très dynamique mais trop de pression
good,Amazon is a good place for part time students or people with no job experience background. The pay is minimum wage and the work is sometimes hard but the atmosphere is good and the staff is very friendly.
good,"To work with Amazon one needs to be flexible and adaptable to continuous changes in the methodology. I have been working with Amazon for last 5 + years and worked in different processes with operations and Quality. Learned root cause analysis, stakeholder management, quality tools, data analysis and more."
good,"Give employees job security, put your employees first, understand their needs, be understanding, not everything is about a quota... Allow employees a monthly meeting to discuss problems they are have having with the work inviorment."
good,Very hectic work schedule and environment.  Temperatures in the warehouse reached 110°F with no air conditioning or fans to circulate the air.  Vans were brought inside the warehouse with all the doors closed with engines running. Managers did not allow workers to take water breaks to re-hydrate themselves especially with high heat conditions. You are driven like slaves in that hot environment to point of heat exhaustion.  Not a very good environment for the weak of heart.  Management will not do anything to improve working conditions. A multi billion dollar company cannot afford A/C to keep its best assets [employees] comfortable and productive and efficient.
good,"Stressful on the mind and body, work too and for not enough money, poor management , long strenuous hours, crossing training available in many positions"
good,"10 hr shift"
good,"Work in Amazon maybe very stressful for others. Since it is a Fullfillment Center, they all deal with rate and time. They want you to produce output. You have to deal with short break time and standing for 10 long hours. Really, working hard is what you need here. But in fairness to its management, they treat people fairly without any discrimination. They also give some incentives to its employees. However, I just think that the salary is very low in compare to the physical demand of the job."
good,Management was inexperienced and very patronizing. Most had very poor interpersonal skills. HR department was was very helpful. I worked within the learning department and the Operations department was definitely the most disrespectful towards us.
good,"Amazon is an amazing company but the hours are long; work life balance is very challenging.  "
good,alot of safety rules and inside job. poor work hours  very very work hours. good people and good equipment very proactive on machines and  repairs and updates.
good,"I have worked for Amazon Corporate (FBA Business) for two years and I currently work full time a Work From Home (WFH) position, but I have the option to go into the office once a week. I  did not choose to WFH, rather was required to do so in an effort to save money on overhead costs. "
good,"Typical day was scanning packages and building pallets. Also worked as splitter,  If you worked with a good group of people, they would remove the big packages off the belt to build the most stable pallets.  The sorting center is huge and hot.  They were installing fans in July 2017 when I worked there and needed more.  The floors need better padding for the amount of time you are on your feet.  The pay should be better for a billion dollar company.  I worked with some wonderful hard working people. The best part of the day was when the shift ended."
good,"the equipment for sure could definitely use an upgrade, nothing ever works like it should. The associates are what makes working at amazon fun, not the management ."
good,"I do not appreciate the way amazon cut staff to make there budget need,Not nice at all. They hire and fire staff every season on short notice. That is not fair at all . Management system is horrible,"
good,"started off as a great place to work, fast speed and fun to be at work at the same time, seemed like your manager actually cared about you and your well being. about 3 months in that all changed, they wrote you up for minimal things like being 2 points under the 100% rate for the week, getting hurt and it got to the point i dreaded to go to work"
good,When I first started I loved working there. I was part-time because I was in school. They were willing to work with me. They were asking for A LOT and not increasing the pay and cutting my hours. I couldn’t do it any more. If you’re going to give less hours increase the pay or something.
good,Confusion in Volunteer Time off and proper staffing for volume. Lack of   community spirit of employees. Safety addressed but not quality of work. More hands on training one on one mentoring needed to improve new employee performance.
good,"You knew how to do your job within hours. Training team there knows what they're doing. If you want roles beyond being just an average warehouse worker, there are tons of opportunities to take on other positions. Main negative of this, however, is no matter which new role you take on there is no pay or benefit increase beyond tacking it onto one's resume for work experience."
good,"Amazon is very accommodating for personal situations if you know where to look and have the time to look.  10 hour days, rate and time off task made this position difficult.  Rate and numbers are the main priority.  The atmosphere and culture has changed.  The people with whom you work, if your could communicate, was the highlight of the job.  It is nice to learn about different customs, challenges and to hope you help someone overcome obstacles."
good,Constant requirement of overtime and poor communication from management when working on multiple websites at the same time. Customers from different websites would be funneled into our chat window without any warning leading to further issues while dealing with irate customers. Issues with policies etc.
good,"Hard to get in, but worth working."
good,"Didn't care for my manager. I didn't like how far you have to walk to break room. I was 55 yrs, when I worked there and they had me loading the truck, was very hard for me as a women."
good,"Mangers are not willing to take onsite on new ideas that might better the department and the function of work. Also, pay should be increased for the amount of stress and hard work we put in."
good,"This was a seasonal job during the winter holiday season. Training was entirely self-led and there was very little feedback from supervisors.   For the most part, my day consisted of signing up for whatever hours were available by the time the west coast sign up time opened and then being advised that I was not needed.  Otherwise, I'd log in to sign up and find that there were no time slots available that met my needs.  For the few hours I was actually able to work, I enjoyed being able to assist my customers and I loved the coworkers I met through our internal chat.  "
good,"I was a delivery driver for a temp agency that contracted through Amazon. However my managers and coworkers where all Amazon employees and I regularly spent time with them. Long story short, the hours are long, the pay is meh and you work very hard. Its very fast paced and at times chaotic. You are active and run around all day in all elements, with MANY obstacles. The system has a route but with experience you learn faster ways. The reason I quit was because I felt the pay wasn't worth it. I made 155 a day (this company has raised it to 165 and I've seen others making 175 to 180 a day) which can take the sting away. The hours worked varied but usually 8 to12 a day. Usually 10 on average.They had morning and swing. This job is for you if you like running around, erratic schedules, and having a van jam packed with packages to the top. Just remember to be honest to yourself about your personal fitness, ability to focus on the work and willing to pretty much stay until its done. Be prepared tp help other drivers who have fallen behind, have a variety of routes and buildings from tall buildings, condos, duplexes and the dreaded apartments. You have a certain amount of time per package but its usually hard to meet it and you make up time by delivering at porches at standard houses. Also remember you drive through traffic, deal with residences,stand and run up and down lots of stairs, and have to sort hundreds of packages. Looking back, I don't think id do it again. But the pros are the independence, lack of oversight (you won't hear a peep from managers all day as long as the packages"
good,"Working in a parcels warehouse is exactly as it sounds; you sort packages and load them for routes.  Lots of manual labor, but it's nothing too bad.  It's a part time gig, so don't expect benefits.  Point-blank, unless you've retired from somewhere else and are just looking to make spending money, or you're getting your first part time job, than don't treat this as anything more than what it is: a part time gig that won't get you anywhere vertically, or give you any real benefits.  Sure, I saw exceptions to that rule, and some people with the drive made it up and out, but on the whole, that was quite rare.  Much easier to hire in with a collage degree and come in as management.  So in summation, not too bad as a first job or simple part time job, but don't invest too much of yourself into turning it into something it's not."
good,"Part time order pickers may work up to four hours per day, twenty-four hours per week maximum.  Available shifts are posted on a website or in a mobile app and you're responsible for securing the shifts you want to work.  Lots of competition for available hours.  However this makes for extremely flexible work schedules."
good,"I worked seasonal for Amazon during the Christmas rush and it is no picnic. Idk what it pays now but when I worked there I was getting 12.50/hr for a 12hr shift 6 days a week mandatory overtime. So the pay was good and we got paid weekly but it was ROUGH. Pretty much woke up, ate, went to work, got home, ate, slept, went to work. So don't expect any social life, at least not during a seasonal rush. I was a picker which meant I was equipped with a scanner and a cart and went to all ends of the warehouse scanning items to be shipped out, putting them in the carts, then when full, dropping them at conveyor belts to shipping. This means I was walking all day except during our break and lunch. Job security at least for seasonal is bad its competitive so if you are preforming below estimated statistics you will get let go. A lot of people get cut within the first few days because they can't hack it. No real uniform except the safety vest and gloves. No jewelry and if you have long hair it must be braided up and stuffed under a beanie. There are good security and safety procedures in place to avoid theft and injuries. Also paid training. So if you think you are cut out for hard work and long hours or maybe just want to make a bit of extra cash during the holidays then its for you."
good,"Good place to work if you don't mind not getting paid well.   Lots of upward mobility.   This position is very boring.  There is a lot to learn, but if you are able to learn the complex work, it's not too bad."
good,Good place to work but very stressful. their is no room for any mistakes. managers are given a lot of power and employees have no  way to debate them.
good,"Amazon's workplace culture is stressful,fast-paced,as well as cut-throat. They didn't really seem to care if you injured yourself on the job. They would still work you to death. Ive experienced a fractured ankle while working there. It took them three weeks until they finally sent me to see a doctor that they provided. Even after going to the doctor provided and having doctor statements stating I needed to take it easy. They still pushed me and I was still going too slow for them so they had let me go."
good,Got a lot of exercise and was in good shape and met a lot of good people. Made good money with the overtime. Got to work in quite a few areas. I had quite a few managers in the years I worked there
good,A lot of targets to be achieved. The management varies depending with departments. The hardest part of the job is the long working hours. Workers are not really valued especially if you are employed under an agency.
good,My experience shows that they do not value past work experience and are reluctant to promote by researching work history. they on like new college grads
good,"mal payé, horaires convenables mais pas l'esprit de l'entreprise"
good,alot of the managment doesnt know how to do the job they acquire you to make rate on and you hardly see them throughout the day maybe twice the co workers on the other hand are cool for the most part because you more than likely have the same concerns
good,"I'm not gonna lie, working in Amazon warehouse is fast pace environment. Four Days a week for 10hrs. The working varmint is very learn as you go. Nothing is going to be explained thoroughly so you have to pick up on it quickly or think of creative ways to get the work done."
good,Unknown job security and feels like artificial intelligence manages all the promotions or selection to be offered a permanent position.  Accidental withdraw for conversion to permanent position was irreversible by HR.
good,Hours are long but if you live close by it wouldn't be an issue. Work is steady so you don't get bored or tired on the job. Most supervisors are professional.
good,"Started at 7am until 5pm. You get constant phone calls throughout the day sometimes 10 or so minutes in between calls during slow times. When it was a slow week coming up they would allow you to select unpaid time off out of scheduled hours. Weekly team meetings with your small team of around 20-30 people hosted by the team leader and you would be in a conference call with a text chat allowing you to ask questions during the powerpoint presentations and team leader would allow you to speak to everyone at the end about anything over the headset. All your calls were recorded and your team leader had the ability to listen in to a call without you knowing. Required lunch break was 1 hour which seemed way too much considering its work from home I would've preferred 30 minutes. Required to clock in and out through a time stamp online which counted how long you took lunch and your two 15 minutes breaks. The job was just answering customer calls about orders or anything to do with using the website. Any other questions we got we would transfer to other departments, mainly to amazon card services or to a payment dispute line for unknown charges on peoples accounts. It wasn't took difficult, just involved very long periods of time answering calls. Would been more manageable if the required 15 minute breaks were 30 and the lunch was 30."
good,"Its one of the top-notch organizations to be a part of. "
good,"If your looking for a really part time job amazon is the right place to work. No benefits provided to the employees.  Manage your own time but, amazon hired a lot of people that they don't need every week you struggle, fight for your hours.  It's very difficult to get 12 hours a week we been told in orientation we can work at least 20 to 25 hours a week.  I liked working for amazon if only  can give you a little bit of hours."
good,"fast pace work, scanning boxes, opening and closing pallets, always a stand up before work to get you going. managers make sure you scan at a 180. "
good,I enjoyed working at the Amazon warehouse as a manager during the summer of 2016. It was to keep me busy and save money for college tuition. Initially i started out as a person who packed boxes ad then i was promoted to a manager position overseeing other employees with their work and delegating accordingly.
good,"Amazon is a very unique company.  You'll have the opportunity to work on projects and drive real change.  This translates into working long hours, nights, and weekends if you want to drive for results.  Amazon is NOT for everyone, however; for those with a type A+++ personality, it's a great place to work.  You must be willing to roll up your sleeves and dive into the business and prioritize.  I had the privilege of reporting to the two best managers of my career, but then had the two worst managers of my career, while at Amazon.  A bad manager can ruin the entire experience and take all the motivation out if you allow it."
good,Sorting packages from trucks onto the conveyor belts and placing them onto a pallet so that the packages would be shipped to their distant locations around the world.
good,"My shift start late night to early morning, my immediate supervisor was very mean and rude. she does let anyone to do their job in professional manner, she does not discuss any thing how to perform in job rather yelling at us."
good,Its a good place to work at.   You do not need to keep a gym membership with all the walking we do.  Only downside is part time associates do not qualify for medical benefits.   As a whole company we should be given that opportunity.
good,"Injury frequent among many workers and for myself I am injured for life because of heavy repetitive exhaustion , hard to move to lighter duty work, not a lot of help with"
good,everything is already set in stone so your job function will never change all team meetings are always at the same time management is pretty thorough. upbeat employees and the hardest part of the job was trying to clock in on time when everybody can only clock in at a certain time. so that leaves everybody at the time clock at the same time to clock in and out. The most enjoyable thing about my job was being able to see the available items for sale at amazon that I never knew about like personal insight.
good,"-Very dirty work place no matter how hard and frequently you as an associate tries to clean.Im a month,you cant't even get up to day of pay time off.."
good,Working there was fast paced but it provided a suppotive enviroment. Very physically demanding and challenging. It can be a good job for those who like like the things listed above.
good,Amazon has some great benefits.  The work is for younger people.  If you like hard work its for you.  The people are good but the management is old and needs a revamping
good,it is a fast pace work environment and it is under production. they have long hours and you really don't have time to stop even for your breaks which are timed to.
good,I was very comfortable with my amazons job but because of my exams i resign it. If i get that position and if the same job i will very happily do the job. But as i did it before i am looking some upper position.
good,Not bad to work there unless you keep things organize and the competition among conworker is not good idea but if you like that then go ahead and apply for job
good,It was one Wednesday when I supposed to be one line to receive and one off my colleague supposed to go to another department .He refuged to go and they put me at his place and him at my place without talking to me .I did not say anything I went to do the job .
good,"Very poor management, they want you to hit the target alway, The manager has no idea the way they speak to associates. The leaders have no people skills."
good,"It got to a point where I was working back to back 12 hour shifts and I couldn't handle that, it was getting the way of my life, the work load was becoming a lot and add the weather on top, everything just became stressful. It's a good temporary job."
good,"It's Fine, no politics, everyone works long hours and very quickly.  The company is very much tied to their leadership principles, you will find them in interviews and in day-to-day interactions."
good,Managers want to fill roles to make themselves look better. There is a purge going on currently in other departments so I would be wary about applying to retail.
good,Fast pace area with high expection that are almost impossible to meet. Management is horrible but pay and other staff member are good to connect with.
good,"The facility where I am currently employed tends to throw employees out in the field without much training resulting in a very high turnover rate. In addition, the morale of the employees seems to be very low most likely due to them feeling undervalued."
good,"It was straightt"
good,"10 hours a day packing customers orders. "
good,If you have nothing to do but devote yourself to your job then look no further. If you have a life outside work then this is not the place for you. The hardest part of the job is knowing that you will be there 12+ hours everyday.
good,you'll see that upon entering the culture of work there its not as they make it seem. watch your back because management will write you up without making you aware of it.
good,Great place to work because everyday is different with production. Some days there are a lot of challenges in making sure all product that came in for the day was processed and ready to go out for deliveries to customers.
good,only thing i like was I was able to work from home and saved on childcare. Learned with good metrics you can grow in company quickly. Things I didn't like were you only get 20 personal time a week which is like 3-5 minutes a day for a week.
good,"Work hours are very long while the job is physically strenuous. Sometimes it feels like productivity standards are set without accounting for work barriers and can end up feeling almost impossible to live up to. However, the benefits are good and its nice to have a set schedule that doesn't change."
good,Productivity driven company. Work life balance can but a struggle to handle. Fast pace working environment with daily/hour deadlines. Different challenges each day.
good,"Amazon has great benefits which starts day 1.    However the company it's about Rate and Quality.   If you miss your rate or quality three times in one year your out of a job.   "
good,"its a wonderful place ,it was so simple to work there and getting along with people because every one of themwas firiendly and accomodating."
good,The job can be stressful and some customers can be rude but that comes with any customer service job. The job was fantastic so long as you were on a team with good management. Too many of the leads however were absent. Not there when trouble arose but quick to bring the hammer down if you have a misstep.
good,"For working 12 hour days, 4 days a weeks, they don’t pay you enough. Constantly walking around as a picker. If you take too long in the bathroom, you get wrote up (3 floors, all bathrooms are on the 1st flor and they expect you to only use 5 minutes to get to the bathroom and back) lunch is 30 minutes from scan to scan and off it’s more than that, you get wrote up, if you don’t make a certain quota on things you pick, you get wrote up."
good,il y'a beaucoup d'opportunités d'évolution professionnelle dans cette entreprise. Des formations pour tous au seins de l'entreprise elle même.
good,"The ratings their are very high there in  Joliet, you must keep up with standards they have and they just went up on ratings which makes it worse on employees as a picker."
good,"Some of the coworkers are hard to work with for some but i meshed well with most with a few exceptions, the company is a good company but they need to change there policies on how they handle certain  issues."
good,"Doing daytime work can be very mundane, boring and sometimes irritating depending on who is on your line. unless you try to learn a different position (which comes with no raises) your stuck stacking boxes for 4-5 hours.The later shifts are a lot more physical but a little less boring since its all pallet wrapping."
good,"We would do daily inventory of all equipment."
good,"I worked part time at the fulfillment center, and there is a reason why they only allow you to work part time here. The job itself is easy and mindless, but that makes it a easy side job for the holidays. I did not care for the management, they where very hypocritical and some just had a bad attitude. I only lasted two months, if you're going to work here work a night shift. This way you'll have more to do than just build pallets."
good,"Positiv:"
good,"The internship at Amazon is highly challenging and at times can be really stressful. I got to learn a lot of things but had to spend more than 10 hours at office everyday. During the end I even had to work during weekends to complete the project on time."
good,"Definitely a work-horse, factory mentality;  ""Work harder and faster"" to unrealistic expectation.  Easy to get burnt out due to job duties.  Did not enjoy the atmosphere, though the people were great, the expectations were unrealistic."
good,"The pay is fair, there is advancement opportunities you just have to be in good standing with all the higher ups, management could be better, time off is good, including paid vacation and paid time off, plus unpaid time off, regular over time. The benefits are also pretty good. Overall I would recommend this company, just be ready to work, like any other job."
good,"If you want to work between 10-12 hours and you are ok with that, is a good job."
good,"""Work hard, have fun, make history"""
good,"Terrible hours but I managed since I have no kids waiting on me. I learned to be patient (believe me, you need this when dealing with ignorant customers)."
good,Le travail est fatiguant et les horaires sont pas stables
good,IF you need Christmas money or to pay off that loan this is the place to grab immediate employment and get the cash flow going quickly. 40 hours a week in 4 nights and always OT work available. Mindless monkey type work that gets old after about 6 months but so what.
good,Work place culture is fast pace and all about reaching the numbers.The management is concern only about the numbers and enhancing their career and not the associates.
good,Review written on this job.  Re-orgs are a way of life.  You get a new manager about as often as you change clothes.  6 years and about 11 different managers.
good,Fast paced work environment.  Learned about packaging. Hardest part of the job was walking long distances from one end of the building to the other. Had great management.
good,"This is a good paying job, but they will do anything to fire you. If you do not make your metrics they will give up on you and you will get fired. Very stressful work environment . Quota is out of expectation and feels like you are slaving everyday you come in there. This is not a career job. Company does not let you get very many promotions. There is so many people you a less likely to go picked. Company bases resume off of points. HR is unprofessional and rude. HR is not real HR like other companies. Listen run from this job you will regret working there."
good,Great first job for those young and in good shape.  They will work your butt off. Not so good for us older folks.  Everything comes down to making their numbers.  Very physically demanding work.
good,Globalement amazon de blanc mesnil est bien .mais au niveau des colis il y'en avait beaucoup trop à gérer donc c est à dire beaucoup de retard au niveau des livraisons
good,This job is a good customer service job for anyone interested in being at home and having flexible shifts. Different departments offer many possibilities. Must be able to handle fast-paced work as there are many calls and emails going in and out.
good,"Not a fun environment but the salary was a good motivator. "
good,"At Amazon, the environment is very friendly and a lot of people are enthusiastic to get to work. However at amazon there's a strict role of no electronics which for me is a big thing to consider."
good,Working environment is safe but hours are long and demanding. however Amazon supervisors are very understanding. Smx coaches are very pushy and they don't communicate with the Amazon reps regularly
good,its an ok job your just on your feet 24/7 and its a lot of twisting and turning . They have snacks you can buy but they are a little  more pricey than the store
good,Working at the company was tuff but you can make it through and you work three days out of the week either in the morning or the night the job is very competitive at times.
good,"At Amazon it is a big company where everyone has to hold their own but we are all one big team. When not focused on the hours and labor, it a fun place to work and the time flies by with the workload and kind people around."
good,"I enjoyed it for a while. The work started getting to me, stressed out my body due to the lack of work of other employees and getting moved to different lines frequently"
good,"La journée commence par un briefing, un échauffement, le travail a réalisé."
good,Very physical work.  Benefits are great but hourly pay is low. The opportunity to advance is only for those workers who are average workers.  Not real happy with working with Amazon.
good,This job is very tedious. You usually get hours but its incredibly unsatisfying. It is however easy and steady with full benefits to full-timers. I don't take it for granted its a good job!
good,"Managers are hit and miss.  There's a couple that are absolutely amazing, while the majority seem that they couldn't care less.  Communication and Training are lacking. Turn over is very high due to these issues. It's very physical, a problem typically isn't brought to the light until one is being written up, but there are some amazing people."
good,"The company is good unfortunately management is the main reason for such a high turnover.  Mangement is trained to think the same, favoritism is rampant. Alot of metrics are used to track your performance but it is highly inaccurate but still used to write up employees even though management knows how bogus they are. Sad to see so many employees who come to work in the hopes of obtaining VTO instead dealing with the stress. Very little to no cross training unless your close to the PA's, I have been in the same position for months without being moved, tired.. Easy to understand the large turnover..."
good,I personally worked at the MKE5 buildings (both inbound and outbound) for a total of about 1.5 years. The pay is competitive and the work is easy. The work is extremely repetitive however and burns you out very quickly. The management at the MKE5 facility was horrendous. Not a single manager knew my name by the time I left the employ of Amazon. It is very clear that the managers have favorites and place certain people in certain positions simply because they can. There is almost no circulation of positions if you're not a manager's pal. You're most likely to be sent to inbound or outbound for 10 hours instead.
good,"In my experience and from other sources, Amazon has the highest required production rate per work process than another other Warehouse company. Workdays are 10 hrs long, and workweeks are typically 4 days long."
good,"40-50 hrs week 10 hr shifts"
good,"Amazon is a decent place to work depending on what your hours are and what kind of role you are in. If you are a picker, your nights can be long and repetitive. Great pay for the work."
good,beaucoup de promesse pour rien beaucoup de connaissance passe avant l'ancienneter
good,"AMAZON LAUWIN PLANQUE "
good,"Very little accommodations, and very little training or help offered. Overworked a lot of the time with hardly any breaks. The Human Resources really didn't care about the employee. Got major pain due to medical reasons or physical disability? That's tough and normal for the job, get back to work. Need a minute to catch your breath and sit, or have severely aching bones? You're being lazy and off task, get back to work. Even my co-workers didn't seem to wanna be there. They would only came in for a check and left, and majority of the time others would stand around and talk."
good,I was with this company for more than 6 months. Everything was good until they changed Manager. The hardest part of job is dealing with manager. I will better leave the job if i have to deal with manager. Dealing with manager its like hitting your head on wall.
good,Amazon was good at the beginning but then I noticed that the employees have no say. They move there employees from department without consent. They treat us like merchandise
good,"When if you are full time during the busy season, when it is over they will try and find ways to get you fired because they hired too many people....."
good,good place to work manegers r ok to work with hard to keep on your feet for 12 hours I learned warehouse oprative role I more time was needed there but a good place to work
good,"When I first started working there it was great and then we got new management and he was not as interactive or approachable as the previous. Shift bids quite frequently, so you could not rely on your schedule staying the same for very long."
good,"Amazon is a diverse place to work. The hardest part is it seems to be favoritism in applicants when trying to move up. You learn quickly how to be empathetic,a good listener, and very adaptable."
good,Managers are not always great. I did not mind the hours or the job. I enjoyed most of the people i had to work with. It was harto stand for 8 to 10 hours a day
good,"It was a seasonal job that ended rather abruptly.  i was not prepared for how they handle their seasonal work, and opportunities for advancement are encouraged, but complicated.  also, the very first part of training was what to do about a gunman on campus.  Yikes."
good,The job was fine and easy to do but the sympathy for mechanical issues was non existent. For example i dont believe any issues are accounted for the rate in which you are supposed to complete your assignments. If this were to change then the job would have no faults in my opinion.
good,"If you like working hard and fast, you will do well. Working and communicating with others is a must. You are constantly on your feet, and each day you might either be doing the same exact thing you've been doing all month, or you will have to do three new things you have never done before. The rates keep increasing, but as long as you do not mind the noise of the alarms constantly going off, it is still a fun place to be."
good,"Too low of wages for stressful duties performed per shift and not competitive with other companies with similar positions, and not enough opportunities for advancement of positions"
good,Highly competitive with lots of favoritism. Summer time the building is extremely hot with little to no ventilation. Rates can be punishing on days with no work coming through yet you're still held accountable.
good,"Very busy place to work.  At resignation, I was the inbound dock clerk managing a receiving dock handling 4 tractor trailer loads per hour.  Promotional opportunities are there but highly competed for."
good,"it was a Good place to work untill the managers want you to not work there any more, that is one job that has changed so much now i really dnt plan on going back."
good,Its not for everybody and they don't play around if you aren't hitting your numbers. I think amazon is best suited for seasonal employment not something ment longterm
good,"If you are not in he group of favorite employees you will not do anything then the base job.  Also the lack of communication is hard to know the changes that have happened.  But, if you just need a job, just keep your head down and do the job. the pay is okay and good benefits."
good,A typical day involves standing on feet for 10 hours. There involves a lot of walking. I learned the responsibilities of the workplace and all it involves. The management need work. Lack of communication is the biggest weakness.
good,"Day begins with team meeting. Designated work areas assigned. Receive new hires to be trained and familiarized with proper procedures of the department. Learned to lead and supervise diverse group. Corresponding with area manager(s) to keep pace, meet and exceed daily standards.Work culture is competitive. Long hours, but a three day work week is preferable."
good,"Provide information to management and employees on process  needed to conduct a safe and productive work environment.   Fulfill customers orders with the correct item purchased making sure its not damaged, its complete with all the parts, and provide shipment shipped on the ordered time."
good,"A Normal day would be finding your designated station and beginning to process items, which would be identifying the items returned if they could be resold or not. "
good,"Amazon is at face value a company that you might want to work for,it  is something of a facade. You work long hours with little to no advancement throughout the time you put in. The benefits are the only thing that keep most associates coming back to work every day. They even allow you to go back to school with paying for your schooling with a limited tuition reimbursement. But aside from using the fulfillment center as a place to finish a degree or certificate, it is not worth anyone's time when looking for a career rather than a job."
good,Amazon can be a fun and exciting place to work. The HR and Management teams are always there to help. The hours can be long but the shift schedules make up for long days with fewer work days.
good,I had learn more information In amazon company i had learn how to provide security to people and property and premisis it was an amazing experinece working in Amazon
good,"There is no fun in working for Amazon.   At least not in Haslet, Texas."
good,"great benefits"
good,"You'll be fine if you keep up pace, just don't get hurt or you'll most likely not get paid or fired. You are truly just a warm body to them. You get two breaks a day and lunch."
good,"My goal was to work as a program manager leading and developing an agile team of high performing leaders on a global platform.  Within weeks of starting my job I was doing exactly that. The teams I worked with were incredibly talented and passionate about the work they were doing.  It was fast paced, engaging, and fun!"
good,You get what you put in. But on the other hand you work your butt off for nothing most of the time. You have to be fast paced and keep a rate. Its constant moving and if you accumulate time off task you can be fired.
good,"If you don't have any kind of education this isn't a bad place to work.  They offer benefits from day 1 and offer as much over time as you want.  The management is out of touch with the workers (except for the select few that are in the clicks).  They try to give motivation speeches, but are not good at it at all.  You have to meet a quota (which is to be expected at a job like this ..(any warehouse job will require pretty much the same thing) and if you don't meet the expectations you receive punishment up to / including getting fired."
good,"Gotta get on a managers good side to be moved around in your particular department to learn more things. If other departments need help, they will pull people from other departments to help. Management is constantly changing. You will watch people come in for their first day and some will leave before the day is over, and some will not come back for the next. Turn over rate is high. Hardest part is at the beginning if you are not used to standing on your feet for 10 hour days, it can be difficult to get through the day. Some of the people you work with help make everything bearable though."
good,If you are young and able bodied there is a FC near you no interview required just fill out an application and they will hire anyone that can pass a background check and drug test. Then it's up to the individual to give up their life to the company and if you are a recent college graduate there is a management role for you.
good,Bonne entreprise  mais tu peut arrêter de travailler à tout moment !!
good,Good benefits and a fast place working environment. I have learned a lot about the process of inventory from receiving inventory to shipping product out to the customers
good,I enjoyed working for Amazon when I first started back in 2015.  I was getting along with my coworkers and managers.  Things changed when I promoted to Process Assistant and I noticed more stress was involved because the managers wanted certain duties fulfilled but never trained me to perform the tasks.  The benefits were good but there was no job security.
good,"Work in the fulfillment center is very physically demanding. The bathrooms can be very far away and only 6 minutes is given to get back to your work station if you step away for any reason."
good,"It was good for a part time job!"
good,I enjoyed my time there. The scheduled recently abruptly changed and this forced me to resign. I would recommend this job to any that enjoy the fast pace and never a dull moment jobs.
good,The job was okay the people were pretty nice in there. they were relaxed. I was only seasonal but they treat there employees really good. highly recommened.
good,"It's fairly okay but the fact is this job isn't adding up anything to my professional career."
good,"Amazon demands a lot of its developers, but if you can stick with them, the pay is great, and the benefits are pretty above-average.  If you've got the drive, the talent, and the spare time, go for it."
good,"It is a nice gateway into amazon, but you will want to transition into a proper amazon associate if you like the work at all.  Pales in comparison due to lower pay and lack of job security."
good,Amazon is OK for retire people looking for something to do until a better job.  This location do not give pay raises even if you take on more responsibly.
good,"Amazon was not a bad place to work by any means. However, I felt incredibly expendable considering how large the company was. The face that the company is so well established and successful is great but it definitely doesn't give you a very warm feel while working there. They do have a nice work space with ample food options, however, the food all costs money. I personally hated sitting and staring at a computer all day. Customer service is draining and horrible and it just wasn't for me."
good,To work at a place where you will experience fun and establish friendships. its wonderful at amazon you learn new things where you can set goals and yep that's it.
good,"Company formation and information on the day quota and work assignment group given by management team, maintaining safe work habits bending and stretch before start of the day. lifting and sorting packages base on size and weight. Fast paced involving continuous physical work"
good,"The work days were fairly long, especially due to it being hardly any work. Having nice employees really helped the days go faster. Management needs a lot of improvement."
good,"Delivery to customer that order items online, Items are scanned ,packaged and delivery to customer in under two hours the working environment is busy and very competitive it's overwhelming and very stressful"
good,"If you are a naturally fast moving person that don't mind being on your feet for 12 hours you will be fine, but if you're not then don't apply. The 3 day work week was fantastic, but being on your feet for 12 hours with 2, 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch was pretty tiring. Especially because the breaks are really about 10 minutes and the lunch is about 20 minutes. You're at risk of losing your job for any little thing. For every 1000 items you scan, you are only allowed 1 mistake. If you make more than one mistake per thousand items enough times then you will be terminated. If you are not able to scan fast enough, you will be terminated. If you take a little too long on your break, you will be terminated. If you are not constantly scanning items, they keep track of that on a computer and will want to know why you weren't scamming and you will be terminated. If you go to the restroom too many times, they keep track of that on a computer and you will be terminated. They give you 10 hours of paid time off to start with and then you accrued 2 hours every two weeks, which is good. You also have 10 hours of unpaid time off, which is also good. But if you use all of your unpaid time off you will be terminated. So that means if you are sick and miss two days of work you will automatically be terminated because you will not have enough paid time off and unpaid time off to cover the two shifts(if that makes sense). You will be written up if you use your unpaid time off. So if you are even sick for one day and you work the 12 hour shift you are automatically in trouble because you"
good,Culture has shifted from blame process first to blame associates at every turn. Most managers tend to stab each other in the back over ideas. AA's that are good are over used to the point of exhaustion.
good,I like the job but I do not love it and more so because there is not any job benefit to what I am studying for in college. It comes off better as a temp job and not something I want to do for so many years because then it becomes the same routine that would be expected when walking into the building.
good,"I enjoyed the physical aspect of the job and liked most of my coworkers. Your work assignment was usually pretty clear. Management was all over the place. The warehouse lead was really solid, but mid level management was mostly oblivious. It took them two weeks to figure out that some employees weren't even logging into their job assignment and were just hanging out chatting in a corner of the warehouse the entire day. Other than the previous example, Amazon expects you to work really hard and may require mandatory overtime, which wasn't a problem for me. The worst thing about Amazon is their culture, ironically the one thing they claim is most important. HR is horrible, they act like they're doing you a favor when they need to correct the mistakes of management (such as regularly forgetting to make a note that an employee accepted voluntary time off instead of just going home early without approval). Amazon also regularly claims ""it's all about the numbers"" but that's clearly not the case. My numbers were probably the best in the entire warehouse, yet no offer for employment after the seasonal warehouse closed? I tried to bring that up with both management and HR and all they could tell me is that they have no control over transfer opportunities..."
good,Job at amazon was really repetative with over 10 hours work a day with 2 hours travel there and back which would make it really exhausting.The lunch break we would get we're too small to point where when i got to my locker i would take a small bite of my lunch or a drink and had to head back.Security services we're a mess to point they would always take time off of your lunch even tho you had nothing on you.as for work the hardest part of the job was the repetetion of scanning items and always being worried about scanning the wrong item and losing the quality of your score which could eventually get you fired.
good,Some Management issues but overall ok place to work. At the time i worked there i was a temp and unfortunately the company wasn't able to hire on at the time and my contract as a temp expired.
good,"Very limited advancement opportunities, if someone is in a similar position there isn't an interview its a lateral transfer, even if there are people better for the job"
good,If you have kids you should have a network of family nearby or you'll be very stressed out. The work comes before your life in most cases. Great place to work for singles on a career path.
good,"Great place to work....just go in, do your job, and go home...dont trust management."
good,"Amazon is not organized "
good,I was a job in Integrity Staffing Solution and the hardest part of the job was picking but I like this work daily. I enjoyed my job. This Job drove me to grow and be sucess
good,Well we have to be fast many times we lost planes sometimes you got fired for no reason sometimes it was nice they would pays us food for doing a great job and even made giveaways sometimes
good,"Very physical job, long hours, constant movement. Great pay and benefits though. Expected to ALWAYS meet 100% of the quota. They will write you up very easily."
good,"Extreme attention to detail, long but flexiable work schedules.  Time management, geographically inclined. loading pulling and lifting up to 75lbs. and use of pallet jack,"
good,The job with Amazon is not hard at all for the most part as long as you follow the rules and keep to yourself. It is a easy relaxed paced job as long as you work.
good,The culture really depends on your management. Sometime it was a very fun place to work. Other management made it very difficult to come to work everyday. Good thing is management changed  pretty regular. just don't ever get comfortable.
good,Make sure you follow the rules to the letter and make sure you get copies of any write ups. Make sure you do not have your phone on the work floor. Make sure you are always on time and not let someone use you ID.
good,"Amazon is good part time employment. The breaks are suppose to be 15 minutes per shift but are really shorter which is unfair. Overall, fun place to work."
good,A typical day at Amazon starts by all the staff joining together to let us know the volume for the day.  We are given an area to report to and then we do stretches as a team and then report to our area that day.  Employees are not recognized enough for their hard work.
good,"High expectations, fast pace, good benefits. Very poor work/home life balance. Long hours during the holiday season. Competitive, but there is room for advancement"
good,"Working at the fulfillment center in Etna, each individual person is assigned one job for the day. Work becomes repetitive and therefore is painstakingly tedious. Career advancement is not fair at this facility and management differs from shift to shift (typically ranging from bad to fair at best)."
good,its good job to work for some quick cash and for the summer and holidays overall its and OK place to work for young or old for that matter anybody but i recommended it to anybody
good,"The best option of car-based jobs these days, IMHO. Base pay is given and sometimes you aren't given something to do, but you can (and do) make tips when you have deliveries! "
good,"They hound you on your numbers if you don't meet the required minimum rate of 150 units per hour. Gotta keep up the fast fast pace and don't take restroom breaks while working, take your restroom break during lunch and the 15 minute breaks or you will get time off task. I was there only 1 month and they let me go because i didn't have a minimum uph of 150"
good,At sometimes the work was fast as sometimes to work was slow Sundays we stayed 6 hours Sundays we stayed for it's a okay job just not something you can make a future out of
good,"It's ok, work is hard but what work isn't, you are constantly being watched, you are timed constantly which brings with it mistakes. There is no job security at all and the management want you to hit targets and keep packing quality to a high standard which is just unrealistic. They want quantity at the expense of quality but moan when a box is not packed correctly due to being rushed. Overall though not as bad as the fear mongering media says it is, Amazon is a safe place to work and you can drink water whenever you want and some management will listen to your concerns my only real issue was the pace, it was too rushed, headless chickens springs to mind."
good,"They don't advertise before you're hired or tell you when you're hired that there is a rating system, and you must get 100% everyday or you get fired. Though you get 90 days to prove yourself, they don't tell you after your first three weeks of training you can get a write up, or that once you get your first write up, you have 30 days before it falls off, if you get a second write up before your first one ends, you"
good,"Fun fast environment. Low pay but good benefits, hard to move up/around. Learning curve is quick, loved the comradery of fellow co-workers! Management is decent HR IS TERRIBLE!!!"
good,"Très bonne expérience au départ, travail qui m'a plu! mais déception au final à cause d'une mésentente avec un supérieur abusant de son pouvoir."
good,"The Human Resources staff alone has a large team with little or no care for anyone who has real issues and concerns when it comes down to someone fighting to keep their job. Constant miscommunication, one staff member will say one thing while one says another. No one seems to understand the rules and regulations of the policy alone and it's very difficult to get someone of a higher position's attention due to their ""busy"" schedules. Very unreliable."
good,"Amazon is a nice place to work, depending on your location. However the hours are too long and too many if you're trying to complete school at the same time."
good,you stand for 10 to 12 hours a day doing the same thing. boring if you dont make friends. it was a far travel for m about two hours drive waste of my mileage and gas for such low pay
good,Most enjoyable part was the people; made good friendships. I drove from Lakeland every day so the majority of my check went to that. Would've stayed if the hours were at least 6 hr shifts.
good,"grabbing carts and stowing items  "
good,"If you like a fast paced, competitive, constantly moving, and exhilarating work experience Amazon is for you. Working at Amazon can be stressful as they are very strict on attendance,implementing a point system, in which if you reach a certain accumulated amount of points you will be terminated no excuses. During peak they also implement mandatory overtime in which you could be working an extra 2 hours in addition to your 10 hour shift or even an extra day added to your work week, in which not coming into work will get you a point regardless of your previous arrangements or reasons (excusing medical reasons). There are also many safety guidelines which they are very strict about also. All in all its a pretty uptight place to work when dealing with management, however you will meet a colorful array of people and the pay isn't bad as well, especially with all that mandated overtime."
good,"Ottima paga mensile, poca pausa in 8 ore solo 30 minuti"
good,You have to be quick at everything there. It's not hard just have to walk alot. It is a job for somebody needing a job and not planning to be there for a life time unless you plan on sucking up to get promoted
good,"bonne ambiance."
good,even though they preach quality they are more concerned with quantity. they work you hard for mediocre pay. they have you run around like crazy. i think it would be better if they weren't so hung up on numbers.
good,"Mind numbing work and great for people able to turn their brain off."
good,"Amazon is great place to work, but they only offer part time. You have to meet your production daily if not theirs possibility they might not need you."
good,"Great job, great pay .stressful , exhausting."
good,It is a very productive and fast paced job. Just did not like how when they made initial job offer it was set for Sunday through Wednesday 7-5:30 but at orientation it was Saturday through Tuesday 7:30 to 6
good,"Fast paced..always on a quota..you have to perform this job .this fast or written warning."
good,"Fast paced is expected, so be ready to work. Management was uncaring of employees, however. Ridiculous quotas to keep or you'd get written up."
good,"It a good place to work or learn. but their is only one drop back which is they are hiring third party or some time period contract like : 3, 6 month etc."
good,"You are given only one task when you are hired and do that single thing for 10 hours, 4 times a week. There are opportunities to work for a different department but then the following day you go back to doing the same mundane task. A lot of the times you will just be standing in the spot the whole day which is very boring after the first hour. You have to make a certain rate by the end of the day and if not met, will written up. There is a lot of overtime opportunities but some of it is voluntary and some of it is mandatory. Went through a whole month of mandatory overtime that wasnt during the holiday season and was only given notice after lunch the day before my overtime day."
good,I think is ok for first job cause you don't need previous experience but everyone is under too much pressure. Avoid start on Christmas time where there a lot of new people and it is a mess.
good,"very fast paced and stressful, would get written up if did not meet minimum requirements so if you are slow while working this is not the job for you, if you work quickly then the job is easy to do"
good,"Most days at Amazon were always very unpredictable and required much planning, labor adjustments, critical-thinking, and heavy doses of problem solving. Nevertheless this is what made the culture at Amazon and very influential if one had the right, collaborative team that focused on their goals. The team made succeeding every day a fun, interactive experience that makes it clear how Amazon creates the best leaders on the planet."
good,"You have to be able to walk alot, if you want to work there you have to have your mindset prepared for long 10 hours shifts. The lunch break are very short it seems like because you're tired and hungry."
good,"do not plan on getting more than 20-25 hrs weekly, unless it is during peak season (christmas shopping time). The job itself is not hard, just plan on moving non-stop and with purpose. Depending on which Area Managers are on duty, does make a huge difference (no real consistency with rules and regulations). Fellow associates are usually very friendly. My most enjoyable part of my job is helping people work smarter not harder and being able to coach in safe working environments. The hardest part would be dealing with the miscommunication between management."
good,"I like my job, but the pay does not come close to matching the responsibility or the stress that comes with it. The pay is not competitive with other local businesses and it is not a safe environment to work due to the lack of experienced PIT operators in a fast paced environment."
good,"Como empresa es brutal, debido a que todo se basa en la alta productividad de los trabajadores. En contraprestación, decir que cuando un trabajador está al borde de sus fuerzas lo despiden y contratan a otro que produzca desde cero. Empresarial mente brillante, moralmente sadico."
good,"Hard work, long shifts. Reasonable employer - meets or exceeds legal requirements.  Pressure to meet targets leads to inefficiency - quantity wins over quality."
good,"People were young people also very friendly , not great management . Management was very immature , never really cared about problems or what was going on."
good,"BWI5. The management is complicated. Too much uncertainty. You never know what you are walking into from day to day. No consistency. Management needs to read ""Sticking Points"" by Haydn Shaw."
good,"The pay is decent and I like my overnight shift but these people are extremely disorganized! You're basically a cog in a machine that doesn't come with instructions. No one in authority ever seems to know what's going on, they don't have answers to questions and if you need help with anything, you have to walk miles until you find someone who will then point you in the direction of someone else. Of all you need is a pay check and the promise of over time, then work here. They also have benefits that start day 1, so that nice if you can find time to use them."
good,"Day to day is meeting the requirements of amazon based on customer orders."
good,"I applied for a job at Amazon.com and attended a mass interview and was hired on the spot.  The only good thing about the job was the schedule it was 4x10 hour shifts so you would get 3 days off. The job it self was so mundane at least at the fulfillment center. You would either work inbound or outbound, outbound was the best department or section to work in my opinion."
good,"Wasn't a bad just long hours.. didn't like how you had to walk a certain pace you could even be penalized for being one minute late. Also I thought it was rude how females were fired for not ""moving fast enough """
good,Very difficult and sometimes impossible to hit measurements and quota set. Does not provide any flexibility on schedule.  You can change positions every 90 days
good,"okay, tiring staff was not quite the staff some were rude and some of them looked like they didnt even want to be there. a typical day was come and clock in get to work and do what you need to do then go home,"
good,This company is a good company to work for with its options for benefits. There is a productivity driven culture which can be met if you don't mind to work hard.  It is difficult however to advance further than certain levels of positions and am looking for something more.
good,"Management is not associate oriented."
good,"Responsible for the security and Loss Prevention for Fulfilment centres, middle mile and last mile deliveries at Amazon. Responsible for losses within the storage and supply chain of inventory and customer packages."
good,"Most of the time, it was a little stressful, they set the goals (numbers) of what you were supposed to get a little high. I always pretty much got mine. Out of 2 years I think there was 3 times I didn't get mine. But I was a trainer, and the people I trained say out of 10 people, only about 3 would even make it. There were a lot of very young people that were management, who I thought should not be in that position, they made it about favoritism. "
good,"It was a good place for a college student as the hours were good and pay was good too, but after college it seemed a hard place to advance and ""go up the ladder."""
good,"Work Life balance is poor"
good,It is not a bad place to work if you have no dependents. Work is not bad if  you can keep up with high demand of the rates and management's expectations.
good,"This is a great opportunity for any on that needs a good job. This job is very monotonous. If you don't have the drive to work hard and make your self known you will not move up in this company. The area management is great, but operations management is to say the lease, unwilling to take constructive criticism. The saying ""Those who do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it."" has no meaning at all to any one in Opps. With that said it seems to only be the Facility that I work at. "
good,"With Amazon, you must want to work. its not a laid back job by any means. The communication for the building lacks and definitely needs to be worked on."
good,"it was alright of the most part it was enjoyable "
good,"if you enjoy working with young teens that have no work ethic, then this is the place for you. The pay is good, management is horrible. If the management and rules changed I would go back, because of the pay."
good,Work is hard c'est la devise d Amazon on a vraiment des journée de travaille intense mais agréable une très bonne ambiance conviviale.
good,it was hard work being on your feet 10 hours a week 40 hour a week 10 hours a day.it would be easy to get the job done hardest part was bending done every couple of seconds
good,"As a picker it's kind of discouraging knowing that you're working harder than the stowers while they kick back,talk,and be in the way 90% of the time."
good,"Tis a job......sore feet, tired back, but can pay your bills.  Management is nice, thoroughly train you for success in the warehouse.  Can move up but there is a high turn over rate..."
good,Management needs to find a more organized system of distributing work load into warehouse. Working overnight takes its toll on you during the day. It's a lot of work sometimes scanning and loading packages into the bags.
good,Amazon has very stringent policies which make it hard to keep your account open and functional that's why I decided to close it out and move on to the next big job
good,"I am currently a route courier for a contract company employed by Amazon. Simple and plain, Amazon obviously values their customer base more than they value their employees whom provide support and ultimately produce for satisfying customers needs  "
good,"Only worked there as an agency worker. That's not ideal, but it is what it is."
good,"Poor Work Life Balance. High Work Load. "
good,However production does not equal the hours allotted that should be given to complete daily tasks. Shifts and position's aren't felixble once you have chosen it.
good,"There are good people working there and good managers, but the sad reality of working there every day is that it's a position that only exists until we've trained the computer models well enough that we're no longer needed. With no actual opportunity for advancement or ownership of one's work, the office community devolves quickly to petty territorial disputes and new layers of bureaucracy for no other reason than to create the illusion of mobility and development."
good,"Great benefits and time off options. Management has gone down hill, constantly changing, therefore not given exposure to move up in company in certain departments."
good,"I love my coworkers... I like my 3 days off (most of the time I get 3 days off), my time off but except for my vacation: I believe it should a lot faster than it does. I pack and sorted and became a top performer here for 2 years with no opportunities of moving up since they hire a lot of new grads from colleges, and while they hire all these new grads they don't train them well enough to do their jobs. Meaning you might have a Area Manager that doesn't know what he is doing, but please be patient with them. I strongly dislike the pay, here's the salary breakdown, you can decide rather or not the money is worth the amount of work you'll be doing"
good,"You are always working and get fixed long hours which is a good thing if you want to work and get paid well, especially if you take overtime. Now the bad thing is the job security if you are applying for a seasonal job, a conversion to a permanent position is not guaranteed"
good,IT was ok working there but I wasn't secured in my on the job training. I felt like I didn't acquire everything I needed to know but overall if you can get pass training to somehow make it then you're fine I suppose.
good,"It all depends on which business unit and manager you work for.  If you find the right managers and teams, Amazon is great place to work, you'll have opportunities for growth and advancement.  With a bad manager or team, it will become a grind.  You'll quickly find yourself wanting to explore other opportunities."
good,"Typical Warehouse job Great benefits/Attendance Management as a whole is okay.  But for most people being pigeon holed (Stuck in one or two) functions day in and day out is unbearable Not only are the rates getting ridiculously higher but for most people  --they either just quit or get fired If U ask management to learn something new Regardless on how ur doing w ur rate They either drag their feet or not give U what u asked for Hence U either end up quitting or getting fired "
good,To work here you must have motivation physically and mentally. Long hours and manual work but pays well and offers many benefits. I enjoyed my three days off.
good,"Je trouve que c'est pas plaisant d'aller travailler dans ces conditions , les gens sont pas content"
good,"More hours, now that they have a younger highering staff they need to understand that the older generation is going back to work not for fun but to pay bills and to give them a chance.  We as a generation pay more attention than kids and get things done without problems."
good,"Fun place to work, very busy during holidays but afterwards it was very slow. I was a temp so I don't have much to say. As far as work they had a high rate that they expected from you"
good,Hard and repetitive work long hours. Unless you plan on going into management. Don't expect to stay longer than three to five years. Or you have a specialized skill that is useful to career.
good,"Worked 4, 10 hour shifts. Being in leadership is was 4, 12 hour shifts. Working 1 on 1 with associates all day long. Safety and workers moral was number one priority."
good,"Amazon is a fast, energetic environment. Quickly will hire someone; yet the labor you put in will not be missed. Breaks are not considerable. Hours and shifts are not well balanced."
good,"It's work. If you dont have a college degree it works out with it's red flags that you either cop with or leave the company. If you live far it really isn't worth the drive once you include gas, bills, just trying to take care of your life and kids if you have them. There is a lot you can say about the managers and the organization of the company but that'll be found out if you work there or not. I will say this though, working at this company and how they have made life so convenient for people to order quickly receive the items they order quickly and the volume that they offer for customers only takes away from the people that work there. Being made to do overtime no matter if it interrupts your daily life they give you time but once its gone no doctors notes or actions will keep you from losing your job. It's not a job for the lazy and the favoritism will be what comes along with the job. No one is a friend and always at the end of the day its all about the Company. nothing else matters."
good,"There is no difference working on a warehouse environment. Just do your job and no questions ask. Just make sure to meet all your requirements when it comes to productivity and quality, otherwise, area manager will write you up without any questions."
good,My typical day at work at Amazon was stowing items on bins and training new hires. I enjoyed working there cause they had a lot of over time. The hardest part of the day was dealing with the heat on summer. Management was also  not good they had their favorite employees. I learned how help others and trained them on their job duties.
good,"Your day starts at 7am and ends at 5:30pm , Sunday thru Wednesday. Working at Amazon you with a diverse population. You learn to receive and stow the products. The hardest thing about working at Amazon is stressing about not making 100% and above with rate. Not knowing the unknown if you from day to , thtaaday wondering if have a job or being written up for not making rate. Overall, you make new friends, that makes it worth while to be employed at Amazon."
good,Nice place to meet new people great pay but the company policy and rules makes no sense. The company get rid of people and replace them like nothing. They are always in overtime.
good,"Fun , friendly working environment, the job can get boring due to you doing the same thing everyday and not being challenged often.Shifts are hectic but you eventually learn to make it work."
good,I was entitled to come to work do my job the best I possibly can and exceed at doing it the best I could. There at Amazon I received $12.35 a hour which was great for the things I did it was like an  exercise to me.
good,"-Management could be better"
good,The pay and benefits are good. the management sucks. they do not value their employees. it is hard to advance in the company because they hire outside college grads first. once the college grads come in they start asking the associates questions because they dont even know how to do their job. you work 10-11 hours a day with only 30 min lunch break and 2 15 min breaks that you spend most of that time walking to the breaks rooms. the managers are strict on time off task. you have to be working ever second or you will get written up for tot.
good,i would never go back here it gets worst every month the checks are nice but u never know if your going to get fired they over work u. they need to pay 15-18.75 per hr.
good,"Safety is no 1 priority for them but if your  unpaid time is in minas for medical reason, they will fire you. Turnover of  manpower is very high. They will not accept the medical certificate and yes one associate told me if  your upt ( unpaid time) is in minas then it is depend ""who are you"" if u r ... then you can work or go home."
good,"Worked at Amazon (seasonal) for little over 3 months. I left before peak season started due to another job offer. I was an overnight picker and quickly learned how everything worked and what they expected. First off, you 100% feel like a robot with little to no connection with management, and always contemplate life because it feels like a prison. Second, being on your feet for 10 hours a day / 4 days a week can be rough, but your body quickly adapts. I worked my butt off to ensure my productions rates were met every day and all week. If you didn't make your production rates, be prepared to get fired. Very frequently I would called on my scanner to meet at the picker management desk, to receive gift cards, shirts, raffle tickets for exceeeding production rates. In a nutshell, If you're a work horse and don't mind mediocre pay. Work at amazon"
good,"Hard, hot place to work. No communication between personnel. The best part of Amazon are the great benefits. Stocks, excellent insurance. More suitable for younger people."
good,"Great work place for growth. Good managers that are open for suggestion about things that could be better. Safety focused, with rewards for safety. Great place to work."
good,honestly the job was okay the pay was also okay but it wasn't worth the stress that came along with the job i worked in a new building which is probably why it was so poorly run
good,Nice paying job but the hours from 6p-6a are very draining to me. I loved working as a sorter a very easy job especially if you move pretty fast with your hands.
good,Overall a good working environment but no bank holiday or weekend allowances and you're expected to work then. Sometimes made to work overtime with little notice which can be difficult when you have children. However the minimum weekly hours were 25 5 hours a day which was good
good,This is a fairly common job for people looking to make some good honest money quickly. The workers were good and the pay was decent but it would be hard to advance unless you worked there for a long time.
good,"Amazon was a fast paced warehouse where all they cared about was getting orders together. Luckily, I was in ICQA so i just had to keep inventory of the warehouse. During peak season, they will cross train you in other departments that they are lacking in. It was an okay job. Breaks were awful and you were on your feet all day. The best part about the job were my coworkers. Drama of course went on but what job doesn't have drama. Overall, i would recommend this job but not for a career. It pays the bills."
good,"A typical day at amazon is chaos. I work in problem solve so we do the best we can to resolve issues that occur. What I have learned is that like most corporations is that they really don't listen to the people that have been with the company forever & instead listen to college temps that have no clue how the building operates. Though they might have a degree you can't just walk into a building and know everything no matter how smart you are. It takes time to get the layout down. It's only 1.6 million sq ft to cover. management is a joke because management changes literally every 12 months. sometimes earlier by the time they get their job down they are off to learn a different role. workplace culture well that's the best part of my job. Everyone for the most part is nice & full of joy most of the time. Very diverse & amazon does a great job at giving out cookies, snacks, holiday pay, the whole nine yards etc. The hardest part of my job is excepting the fact that sometimes we miss polls.. sometimes a child doesn't get his Christmas gift on-time. The most enjoyable part of my job is when we make a poll within seconds & rush all the boxes to the truck. It feels nice to know that even if I'm not appreciated at work sometimes that a customer got their order, or gift on-time or even earlier than expected. This really makes my job worth while. It can be a fun place to work at & if you are looking for a different type of warehouse job this is definitely the place to tryout."
good,"I learned a lot as I problem solve and fixed orders for the customers. I was lead and Ambassador which taught me to be a leader.  Hardest part of this job is that the leadership is favorable to certain people and not on a mature level of leadership. I tried to help change that and unfortunately, it has not."
good,"A typical day is having start up meetings explaining expectations for the shift and any possible OT available. What I've learned is how long it actually takes for a package to arrive to a customer and if failure to meet deadline the cost of the company to compensate an unhappy customer. Overall management was pretty good and very standardized with protocol. The workplace culture is working as hard as possible and meeting the daily requirements to be successful. The hardest part of the job is the manual labor, it does catch up and become fatigued. The most enjoyable part is knowing the many products Amazon does offer that you wouldn't have known about."
good,Very long hours and sweat shop conditions at times. The work was very hard and you do not get off your feet all night long. Working night shift also turned out to be very hard.
good,It was a nice job to work. Hours were great and worked with my life routine. But I also feel that the lack of care for employees is a big issue. The short breaktimes and the lack of fairness were a big issue for me. Management were mostly nice but questions and concerns were not a priority. It sometimes led to trouble for lack of communication.
good,"A typical day at work for me is 12 hours of moving and lifting. You get dirty and smell terrible by the end of the night."
good,The culture coming from management seems to be to always push everyone harder and faster. Everyone is easily replaced .Benefits are quite good but salaries seem low for many positions and the responsibilities they carry.
good,"When The building I was working at just opened, the environment was great. Very soon as Managers began to turn over, the environment began to dwindle, and it became more about numbers than about the employees."
good,"Nice to work but completely unorganized. I applied and was told at orientation and this was a part time job and I could pick my schedule to work around my other job. Once I showed up for my first day of work they told me I was assigned ever Fri, Sat and Sunday 5pm-10pm for as long as I was in that position. Which conflicted with my other job and never was I told about this until my first day. I would have applied else where or a different location if at any point anyone would have told me before hand or even during orientation."
good,"Amazon has some great benefits, such as insurance, paid time off, and stocks."
good,"Typical work day consisted of taking inbound calls from customers -  assist customers placing orders, track packages, replace damaged or defective items received, coordinate with carriers to locate lost or late packages. Contacting 3rd part sellers via email to assist customer with locating packages, cancel orders."
good,"On the surface the company seems very good offering good pay and benefits, but after a short period of time they began to show what they are really about. Every time people would ask for a raise they would change the topic. They do not give you a choice on which department you work in often times. A review in two words; empty promises."
good,"Clock in start working within 5-10 mins, when there is work there is work. As long as you keep a professional relationship with fellow employees, you will enjoy your time there. Depending on which FC one is located at, rates may be a bit tough to keep up with if you are not comfortable in a fast paced environment. The best part for a student as myself is that it is four days a week ten hour shifts and a wide variety of schedules."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, capacidad organizativa, confianza en el operario, sin presiones de superiores. comunicacion, etc."
good,"Shipment loading & unloading"
good,I learned at amazon that there nobody cares about pepole everybody cares only about numbers . Half of managment was fine another half was rude. Hardest part was stand all shift on your legs .
good,"Good for insurance and other benefits, They have horrible work schedules. And no one  knows what they are doing, and you have to clean up after other shifts. Almost everyone is cranky from all the OT they make us do. Do not expect to move up to management unless you know how to brown nose and be lazy. Other than that it has some good things about the place."
good,"There is upper management now focus to growth of our lower employee.  "
good,"The job was mostly enjoyable, a typical day at work consisted of picking items for customers to be sent to their homes. It was a 10 hour shift and the hardest part of the job was standing for 10 straight hours."
good,"Amazon pays pretty good to those who don't mind getting dirty. They train you up pretty good even though they should do all the training in a class room instead of part of it. The on the floor training will have your feet hurting before you even start. Your constantly being clocked while working. Its so many people you work with that management is useless. The Hr department is the best place to be. If you don't mind standing or walking its great for you. If you manage to be a employee of amazon and not temp you start your first day with benefits. Two 15 min breaks and one 30 min should not be allowed these types of jobs. I believe it should be a minimum of one hour because of the demand of your body. By time it takes you to reach the time clock get your food, heat it up eat its time to go back."
good,great job it pays very well but the night shift is really hard. long hours and it gets real busy long amounts of time standing on your feet all day but very good pay.
good,Amazon was poorly organized. Everyone is rude and disrespectful. I would not recommend the job unless you're like me in major need of money. It really is not worth the pay. You don't receive much money if you don't meet rate. I think associates should get paid hourly.
good,Amazon is a great entry level position job wouldn't recommend it  long term but for a year you could gain lots of money only problem is the work is mundane unless your promoted
good,A typical evening of work at amazon was ten hours one thirty minute lunch and two paid fifteen minute breaks.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the incentives and benefits.  The least thing that were beneficiary were the available shifts and company size.  Management there were great.  The employees were down to earth and very homey.
good,Amazon is a fun and safe place to work. Most of the time everything gets over thought because the bosses have no prior business experience. Thus far making it more stressful on the employees at time.
good,"Working at an Amazon Warehouse is a great job as far as compensation but it can be physically demanding. A typical day at work consisted of me locating and counting the contents inside a assigned container. I was able hone my inventory skills with this job. Management at this job was somewhat impersonal. After training day, you're basically on your own. Majority of my day could be isolated unless another employee has a assignment near me."
good,"A typical day involves helping customers with any issue that they may have through emails, chat and phone services."
good,"This company is not too bad.  They just need to change the way they pay and treat the people. The way things are set up can be made a little different. Overall, they can do better."
good,Ho imparato a usare il muletto. E a gestire gruppi di persone.
good,Amazon gives great benefits to its workers because they work you like a dog. I don't know how people stay their for years at a time. Its so time consuming and hard on your body...especially your feet.
good,"Amazon offers many valuable products but how the products were handled within the fulfillment center was poor. It was difficult to see the products being mishandled and damaged by others with little regard to the customer. I was grateful for the benefits with regards to insurance, 401K, and time off. Workplace culture was often negative with poor morale. The hardest part of the job was meeting the expectations asked without adequate support from management. The job was also very strenuous on the body as well."
good,In working in this company I learned a  lot about myself who I can trust and who I can't trust.  But in working job I know that can hold anything that life come my way.
good,"My opinion and experience as an employee there was as follows:"
good,Just not a great place to work for. Healthcare is poor. Management is poor. Job work is not challenging at all. If you are a customer ordering something then that's great.
good,"Working at Amazon is OK. They place heavily on you to solve problems created by other staff and don't seem to ever confront those who are creating the issues in the first place. It is disorganized and even though it is not always that way, it tends to be more than not. Which in turn makes work stressful."
good,"Amazon will hire almost anyone, they do however expect you to meet production goals. This isn't an easy job and you will have to put in the effort but it will be rewarding."
good,"You spend 10 hours 4 days sometime 5 days working no music,  just standing, it gets really hot, your knees will kill you they first 6 months you work their and your knees dont get better. They dont really care about you, they care about their numbers. but they always have overtime which means more money in your pocket."
good,"The hours are long, and the conditions are not very safe. On staff medical team is nice but the only way to leave the plant (even with a work related injury) is using your time, which you slowly earn or leave in an ambulance. Had to file for medical leave and the process was very chaotic."
good,"Job is very repetitive, boring and most times not fulfilling. Some rules are enforced and others are not. All employee are not held to the same standards."
good,Management trop changeant avec des nouveaux manager avec qui il faut réa prendre a travaille/connaitre et une communication presque inexistante !
good,"10-12 hours shift of constantly standing, walking, climbing ladders and squatting. Not for anyone who is lazy or doesn't feel like working. Loud environment from machines and conveyors. 2- 10 minute breaks and a 30 min meal break."
good,"Poor management, they did not really run things well. Great job security and pay for the type of work you do. There are better jobs but if you need it go for it."
good,"The job is fast pace , very tiring, leadership is poor due to lack of communication, the pay period is bi weekly,  the health insurance is good but the company policy and benefits aren't all that great when it comes to your family or extreme weather conditions, they expect you to be there on your expected shift no matter what is in the way ."
good,pas tres agreable il faut toujours courrir ainsi que le cota qui qui n en fini pas
good,"Because we finished our tasks early, we usually ended up doing some of the work for the next day shifts, including tasks that arent in our job description. I understand thats usually expected though."
good,"Wish they could pay a little more than 13.50. It is what it is, its a simple job. Anybody can do it and the pay is good when it comes to over time. Benefits are good."
good,"Because of the size of the organization, a lot of issues to solve, lot of leverage to bring change with suppliers. Room to learn a lot in a short period of time."
good,"You'll work hard and work for long hours, the pay is relative to the work though, so it's not all bad. If you want a chance to see how one of the biggest online suppliers gets the product to its consumers, this is an ideal place to start."
good,"Le métier de préparateur de commande est intéressant mais intense! L’environnement et l'ambiance de travail est assez agréable! "
good,Job is getting worse and worse with management and employees. Place is always a mess. And money is not there at all. Very stressful with no respect for your work that you do.
good,"management plays favoritism , sometimes other workers get away with write ups because a manager likes them. they don't give enough time off.. they only give a 30 min lunch and 2 15 min (really 10) breaks. when you work a 10 hour day."
good,"I definitely had a extraordinary experience. The only issues was the lack of organization with time of shifts and dealing with the inconsistency with effective communication, especially with peak season. Overall I meant great people, learned great skills, and I would be interested in working most any other position besides a warehouse laborer."
good,"Doing 12 hour nights at the warehouse was tough at first but you end up getting used to it. However, the AMs or Area Managers, didn't seem like they were doing their best. Some were just rude, some seemed like they abused their status and threatened some workers with write ups if they mess up in the slightest instead of helping them to fix the problems they were facing. All in all, it was pretty alright to work at."
good,I enjoyed working here but had a lot of shift changes that didn't really suit but had no choice the people are great and always enjoyed the job have worked in most departments and enjoyed all of them for different reasons
good,Extremely fast paced.  Lots of walking.  Great way to earn money and get into great physical shape.  Management staff concerned about your personal work success.
good,"If you want a good part-time job, Amazon is the place for you. I don't recommend Amazon as a full-time job. The pay is not that great, but you employees do get pretty sweet discounts on different things."
good,Amazon is really what you take from it. Every job has its pros and cons and Amazon is one of them. Just try to find some enjoyment out of it and you'll be fine.
good,"The typical day at work is really chilling , you are just given targets and you need to complete that, thats all there is no additional pressure. If you are a  good performer you will be recognized as well. What I learned  is great management skills, about how to handle people, I learned a  lot of people management skills. The training in amazon was the best part. It is a  lovely place  to work as there are weekly fun activities. Its a  great place to work at. However I wish that salary should  be  as good as the company, but unfortunately its not."
good,12hrs overnight shift is hard but the money isn't bad. Management leaves a lot to be desired. A lot of standing around doing nothing most of the shift.
good,Pay is good. Benefits are decent. I would not recommend if you can't stand for 10 hours plus a day. I wouldn't consider this position as a permanent employment.
good,people management handling day to day operation rostering  salary process inventory for operational requirement safety training for on board staff and tracking of shipments.
good,"Amazonas adesivos é uma empresa ótima de se trabalhar, pontual com pagamento, investe muito em segurança. Peca um pouco com sua liderança, que não valoriza muito estudo."
good,"After working in this environment for 2 years I have noticed that Amazon is a bit on the sly side. They constantly hire too many people, then fire too many when work declines. After a peak season every shift was operating on a skeleton crew, but the paper will say that Amazon hired 500 new people in a month or 2. The work itself is not too bad, though be careful of others because they tend to work extremely unsafely. Safety has been addressed by most of the staff (including myself), though management is more focused on numbers, whether they admit to it or not."
good,"A lot of changing in leaders, rules, etc.  Lack of accountability with so many people during peak time.  There are many parts of the operation that could be improved to be better efficient."
good,No advancement good people nice place to work has ac in he building. Good pay only part time. Hr is good management is bad. Good break rooms 15 minute break
good,Very good compensation and benefits.   A typical day involved trying to get as many customer returns processed.  Does involve standing for long periods of time.  Which would be the hardest part of the job.   The most enjoyable was how diverse the workforce for Amazon was.
good,"Amazon.com was a good place to work, great people, great management. I learned a lot about management and handling difficult situations with associates."
good,"Good challenging work"
good,"With this unstructured environment, it gives alot of opportunities however ends up giving it a miss on work life balance. "
good,in the sort center its pretty fast pace its scan and drop and move fast. Not everyone pulls their own weight so do your best in every job because it all trickles down to every job.
good,"A typical day at work is like any other day. I've learned quite a few things working at Amazon. It was a good place to work and well mannered people to work around. The hardest part of the job was lifting some items that was particularly bigger then me and the most enjoyable part was working alone, at my on pace but a steady one."
good,an Ok company has is up and down with employees work ethic. a typical day is 10 hours long. most enjoyable part coworkers.
good,"Hard work, for an honest paycheck. i have never worked harder than i do during a day at the Amazon factory. the hardest part of the job is walking upwards of 10 miles a day, and the constant bending over and picking up 50 lb packages frequently"
good,"To be a delivery driver for Amazon it's great ,But the management in down ,They change the rules every day and testing on the drivers!"
good,"a typical day at amazon is managing all of the product. I'm in charge of making sure every package at my station is packed/fixed and leaves the sort floor. hardest part is all the liquid/hazmat damages we receive. the most enjoyable part of the job is learning new computer skills since I'm always using amazons software such as logistics. management just leaves us alone and lets us deal with our own issues, they just want it done."
good,"I have worked for Amazon for 4 months. It is honest, hard work. You can come to work in very casual clothes and the people that work there are very nice. You will be standing, lifting, bending, kneeling for 10 hours a day, which makes it very difficult to function after work. I come home exhausted. It is good exercise, a decent living, just not a job I can see myself doing for a long period of time."
good,"walking around scanning  sorting "
good,"Working for Amazon means thriving in ambiguous and high stress situations. The part-time business model and lack of work-life balance (70-80 hour weeks are typical) drives high turnover and attrition. Planning and executing shifts to ensure that hundreds of thousands of packages are delivered on a daily basis is an absolute adrenaline rush. Working swing shifts and all holidays can be a burden, especially on family time and physical health, so making the most of time off is essential. Call offs cannot happen in leadership positions due to a lean hierarchy and specialized roles. Senior leadership has a tendency to turnover frequently which can lead to fatigue especially in regards to change management and development of new corporate culture."
good,Amazon is a great place to work if you can stay away from the drama. Very childish management. Hardly move up with the company.
good,"This is only a side gig, paid $10/review. Looking for something more full or part time. I would work at this gig in addition to a more serious job that has more stability."
good,"This job was great. Steady work hours and pay, great people to be around, and overall great place to work at. The only downside was that my feet hurt after being on them for 8-10 hours a day."
good,"Uma Empresa Boa no mercado, possui uma estrutura boa para seus funcionários e clientes...Possui plano de carreira para os funcionários, valorizando os mesmo...."
good,L'image qui ressort d'amazon dans les médias est pour moi non justifié car le contexte est agréable et l'allure pas si abondante.
good,"Day shift is started at 8am. A s a packer I`m responsible to pack items in correct way, in right box recomendation. 10h shift is hard for longer time. It`s a good place to work for people durable physically ( all the time standing/walking)."
good,Amazon will be a great place to work if a few changes are made to improve management. Constant changes procedure and rates.
good,"Lack of structure and organization.  Management dishes out demands and doesn't listen to those doing the work.  I have learned to multitask and work in different departments."
good,a typical work day consist of receiving bulk freight and finding space to stow things away for vendors. Picking customer orders and space consolidation. Problem sloving product to ensure customer quality.
good,"travail de 6 mois en intérim, ai passer un bon moment , l'environnement y était agréable mais il faut savoir s'adapter a la politique de travail anglo-saxonne typique a amazon"
good,"An average day working at Amazon consists of repetitive actions depending on which department I was working in. My last function working at Amazon was in the packing department. I was able to do several different jobs throughout my shift which helped make the 10 hours go by fairly quickly. Upon keeping an above average rate in pack I was also called upon to have an indirect role which enabled me to move around and help replenish stations with certain inventory the employee would need to do their job correctly. Management would always come to me to do any job that needed to be done swiftly and efficiently. I think I was most proud of being able to help the other employees effectively carry out their job duties without any problems. I was and am always willing to help a fellow associate execute any job they might be having issues with. The end game is to make sure the customer receives their items on time and undamaged and in doing so the employees need to have the proper tools to carry this out. I would always go above and beyond for management and associates alike to make sure the operations ran smoothly. I had very good relationships with everyone in the warehouse, employees and managers in other departments all knew me by first name and were very respectful."
good,"I like it but I don't see myself making Amazon a career choice for the future. The benefits are awesome,and I learned four different positions in the warehouse. I enjoy meeting our daily goals because it gave me a sense of accomplishment. The hardest part about the job was adjusting to the 12 hour shifts before Christmas. Management was easy to talk to for the most part, all of my managers were very social and comfortable to express my concerns to."
good,"In my 1.5 years of role at Amazon - the only constant that i saw was the senior leadership - which comprises of true blue Seattle-bred Amazonians. "
good,"If your looking for a job that isn't very bodily tasking then this is the job you're looking for. It is not a bad place to work at but, when I think of work I think of being worked and moving around. Not staying in a 5 foot radius for 10 hours."
good,Culture is very fast paced.  Must be willing to be very flexible and adaptable.  Upward advancement is possible but slow.  The most difficult part of the job are the long hours you may be required to work and a moment's notice.
good,"I spent 3 years at amazon. At first I loved it. I was proud to work there and loved the job. As time went on, things went down hill. I trained 3 of my managers straight out of college who had no idea how to run a department. As a former manager myself, I tried to help these new managers out as best I could, but each one wanted to fix what wasn't broken and reinvent the wheel. Overall the environment went sour and a lot of good people left. I'm sad because I really did love working there and was sorry to see things change and not for the better."
good,Empresa calçadista com muitas oportunidades de melhorias.
good,"It's a great job to make quick money. I don't believe it's a job I would see myself in for years and years. The management was difficult at all times, in my experience, and nobody was ever willing to lend a hand or point you in the right direction when you needed help. I had a poor experience with the HR department as well, trying to accommodate with my school schedule. They were not very reliable."
good,"Beaucoup de stresse, mais un bon encadrement."
good,"very physically demanding work (walking up to 13 miles per shift)"
good,j'aime beaucoup travailler chez amazon la seule chose qui ne me convient pas est le principe d'evolution
good,"Long hours 10-11 hour shifts, all physical unless you are working in HR or Amcare. Easy to get write up even when you are new. Management needs a lot of work. Best thing is the benefits dental, vision, and healthcare are what keep people there and also the 4 day schedule."
good,"First i had to travel, then waited around for an hour, then loaded my van for the round  i was going too   then i did the deliveries on my round all though some varied. deliveries done ,back to the depot with the bags then back home ,sometimes i did moonlighting , "" some extra work"" ,"
good,A day at this establishment is very secured and to strict on their policies. Management team for each department lack communication with the team but overall expect highly of them. The hardest part of this job is learning each department and the qualification of them. Overall it has a nice benefits package but a high turn-over rate.
good,Same routine day in and day out. No incentive for work production. Management is understanding. With high production rate there is not much time for socializing. Job tasks were simple. The most enjoyable part of the day is Lunch.
good,Cool and fun place to work at. Very fast paced. Nice people. If you're physically fit then it's the right job for you. 10 hours a day and you get two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch break. Very excluded from your family (if you're around them all the time)
good,"Hardest part almost everything at times "
good,Even though I made good money at Amazon I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. The conditions are harsh and the company has little to no sympathy for its employees.
good,"A great stepping stone to kick start your career. Great HR team, work hard and make history."
good,at work i used to have a long day i used to wake up at 4 and reach the work place at 7am finish at 6 30pm during the day i use get 2 breaks for 15 mins and get a 30 mins lunch break. the hardest part of the job was that i had to walk all day and meet my deadlines.
good,"Fun company with great people. The hours are long and it's hard work, but you are paid well for it. Management is helpful and understanding,but the attendance policy is strict and leaves no room for illnesses. They do not accept doctor's excuses nor do they tolerate laziness. The best time to work there is peak (holidays). Shifts are 10 to 12hrs. Be prepared to sweat! They promote fun as long as you keep moving while you do it!"
good,"*Need to restructure the management"
good,"Very strenuous work but for the most part if you are a hard worker and physically able, you will adjust.  Managers are great. The HR Dept is very unreliable.  You will constantly have to watch your UPT and PTO hours. Even if you VTO, they will most likely take time away from you. Also, during peak, do not expect to have much family time.  Good money but no time to spend!"
good,"Feedback from customers can make employees star. Conversely, any negative feedback can throw an employee out of the company."
good,I have enjoyed learning about Amazon.com through supporting sellers and now helping test and launch a project within the company. There are many resources available and opportunities abound to improve and grow within the company.
good,you will work lots of 10 and 12 hour days. Sometimes 6 days a week especially during the holiday season. There is a lot of walking when you are a picker and some heavy lifting. The pay is good though!
good,"Learned New Application is the good thing, no dress code policy, Work from home policy is there. People are too much professional. Co-workers are okay."
good,We started our day with meeting with the management and our plan for the day. We were then given 2 minutes to find our station and log in and scan our first item. Management would stop and ask us our opinion or advice to make things better but then we would get written up for not being productive and yet would not take any feed back the employees would give. It is the co-workers that made it easy to work helping each other out. Hardest part was when they always changed the system about 3 times a month and needing to learn new procedures. The employees is what made the company fun.
good,"The management is not up to par, co-workers were great, money was sometimes missing from my check that i had to show proof of working to get that back"
good,"typical day at work is responding to breakdowns all around the whole building and having to get there in a timely manner"
good,"I am an expendable employee and am treated as such. Given the size of the hiring pool and the nature of the work, I can't rightly expect a personalized, responsive management, but I can't help but be somewhat disappointed in the degree to which individual workers are marginalized within the company."
good,They hire people straight out of college who have no idea what there doing. and never done are job before.it use to be a nice job but it seems like the more amazon makes the worse it becomes.
good,me parece buena empresa lo unico que deberian ceder mas con los trabajadores todos los dias no se va igual a trabajar unos dias se te da bien y otros peor no por lo cual si no cumples sus espectativas de trabajo te echan .no se puede compara una persona de 20 con una de 40
good,"While change is always expected in a business, change for the sake of change that always keeps employees off balance an not understanding their daily job duties is not business conductive."
good,"Amazon was focused on customer obsession. Procedures and policies were still in development and ever changing. Hardest part of the job was that a large percentage of the management staff had never supervised people or managed any business, but also led to challenging ideas which was good. Exciting to be on the Wild West frontier and be successful."
good,"I worked the docks at amazon, we would use pit equipment or unload trucks by hand. The job was challenging but rewarding in simple terms, got gift cards or a free soda at the end of day. There was room to move up but it wasn't as equal as management implied."
good,"Could not juggle the insane work hours with family life. Excellent benefits, but most tedious job ever.  Wasnt for me. If you want to eat lunch takes ten minutes just to get to a microwave."
good,"The workplace itself was very mechanical and organised. You rarely got a chance to speak to your workmates because you had to be working ALL the time, at double speed to reach your targets. The start of an average day was easy. We gathered around the crew board while the manager for the day read the days brief and expectations, nearly always told a joke which was a quick chuckle if anything else."
good,"Amazon has a great work environment, which is one of the few benefits of working there. At first, I really enjoyed my time at amazon, as I spent a year working at an Amazon Fulfillment center.  Unfortunately by the end of the year I was really starting to hate my job and eventually decided it was best to quit and move on considering how competitive it got."
good,"Amazon for compensation is lacking, they should be paying a living wage ($15.50 hr or better ) to all their associates. they require a 4 day week/ 10 hour day minimum"
good,i put product in designated locations in warehouse to store them till orders are placed then pickers pull product to be shipped same job everyday
good,"Amazon is a competitive based work environment. They have a ""trample the weak, hurdle the dead"", hire to fire, your job is your incentive mentality. You work with a lot of really awesome people and some not so awesome people, as with anywhere. If you survive, you learn some awesome leadership skills and how to work with others, how to talk to others, BUT you have to want it, work really hard for it, ask for it and hope that someone noticed how hard you work. Keep a positive attitude and you'll be fine."
good,"Normally the days are long and repetitive, few managers have actually  experienced what they supervise; I've always enjoyed meeting new people but if you like working with zombies and sheeple this is probably the ideal job for you. The best part of the job and probably the only thing keeping a lot of people there is the benefits, What ive learned...you can have 4 years of college and still be out smarted by a nobody."
good,"The work is monotonous and demanding, but not terribly intense. The compensation is adequate and the benefits are awesome. Management is nice, but doesn't hold much power."
good,"The experience in the beginning was good. That was a good job with good benefits and great work statics. Then after about 10 months everything changed. The managers didn't quite care for you or if anything was wrong. The only picked favorites to do certain things. After a while, it became tiring and not fun to work in a place where you ship items to customers and have a good experience. The pay is good but not worth it."
good,"10 hour work days standing in one position, working as hard and fast as you can to meet quota which is 200 items per hour packed ( 3 items per box in 30 seconds )  "
good,"A typical day at amazon started with a team meeting about goal we have to reach to make quota for the day. Then employees are sent out to their respective stations. Somthing I leanered from working at amazon was how to manage more than one project at once effectivly. My co-wokres were all plesant to work with, the hardest part of the job was keeping a regular sleep schedule. The most enjoyable part of this job was playing pingpong with co-workers."
good,Physically it can be demanding but its manageable. They pay you well. MY specific department was very fast paced others departments are not so it can feel unfair working there.
good,Good place to learn entry level maintenance. Schedules are not good at all. Pay is okay and benefits are really good. Co-workers are all good but dont have the best training. Training is a serious problem.
good,I learned a lot on taking ownership and initiative in this position.The company culture and environment is fun and productive.It is really sad that my position here is temporal.
good,"Pracovný deň sa začal pracovnou poradou. Oboznámenie sa s novinkami a čo nás v priebehu dňa čakalo. Hneď po mítingu si našiel každý svoje pracovné miesto. Kde nás už čakali objednávky, reklamácie, požiadavky zákazníka a kolegov. Mnohokrát bolo potrebné zaúčať nových kolegov. Takže bolo nutné spraviť školenie."
good,"Been working there for almost 2 years, I enjoyed the experience I learned there but it's time to move on to something different."
good,Decent atmosphere once you first arrive but a very rigorous expectation. Management does shuffle a lot so always be prepared to meet someone new. I have learned a lot about management and logistics in how to operate in a fulfillment center.
good,"long 10 hr never have back up"
good,"The one good thing about Amazon was their benefits which were excellent and started immediately upon hire date, However, the work was very physical. I sometimes walked 30 miles a night which made it very hard to make rate so I was always afraid of losing my job over not making rate. I did it somehow but on the nights when there was a lot of heavy lifting to do, I came home with a hurting back and cramping hands and feet, I finally had to quit Amazon over personal reasons and health issues,"
good,"It is okay place to work,especially if you are going school and work there, they very good at working with your schedule. But all time you login to the end, you are in your rate and too much pressure about rate"
good,"10 hour long shifts 4 days a week working alongside conveyors. This job didn't allow for much movement and for someone who likes to be everywhere at once, this wasn't all too enjoyable for me. Most of the co-workers acted like they hated the place and didn't talk a whole lot. The days went by slow and the management was absent when needed. Not a great place to work unless you are in College or looking to go back as they have a great college reimbursement included in their benefits package."
good,They barely schedule me to work and the times they don't you have to fight for your other hours if you get them. I drove my own car and had to make all repairs on it. I paid for my own gas to delivery these packages to people who ordered from Amazon.
good,"The work was very demanding, fast paced, and had a high turn over in employees.  The work was very physical, and your had minimal training."
good,Amazon believes in hiring managers that have just graduated from college and not people with the experience that is needed to manage the location
good,"Great Company to grow and learn, however the work life balance is really poor. The employees have consistent meetings and work loads it wears employees down.."
good,Has great healthcare but I did not appreciate how management treats some people who try their hardest and getting any kind of promotion is next to impossible since they just transfer people from other facilities half the time. Just want more job opportunities.
good,Amazon is very fast pace and chaotic. I would not like for that to be a long term job. Overall it is a job. My work day always consisted of the same thing.
good,I honestly wouldn't recommend anyone to work for menzies because the management is completely terrible & they are definitely disorganized. They don't want to pay their employees & are extremely rude.
good,"A typical day at Amazon is usually fairly routine. The problem is that the routine gets old fast. The only opportunities that have been afforded to me were being an peer trainer (Ambassador) and the one time that I was inclined for and received a Seasonal Tier 3 position (Temporary promotion). Outside of my direct (rated) role, I was offered indirect roles on occasion. The Senior Managers of the building seemed to be excellent at micromanaging and expected the direct (Area) Managers to handle the morale and direct interactions with their entry level employees. The hardest part of the job is probably keeping it interesting. It has to be the easiest job I've ever had. Your handheld tells you everything you need to do for each individual or specific item(s) and that is it. There is really no chance for advancement unless you are one of your Area Manager's favorites."
good,"Interesting work, fast paced, but a very hot place to work.  There are fans but still a very hot place to work when stowing, counting and packing."
good,"Integrity staffing does not treat their employees at amazon very well. They do not pay enough, ask you to go to other locations for no additional compensation and without warning. They change hours on workers. Even HR workers agreed that Integrity is a bad company to work for and that they mistreat workers"
good,They don't treat you the best. They treat you like workhorses and then will write you up for missing rate but just 1%. They just go around staring at a computer as for management.
good,":long day all the way into the night,"
good,a typical day at work would consider me dealing with a lot of packages . I learned how to sort packages by delivery area requested! my co workers was pretty fair! their was no hard part about the job. I enjoyed myself everyday!
good,"If you have no life and no children then this is the best place for you to work."
good,"The culture is based around it's managers. It's documented all over the internet. Just know what you are in for before you sign on. Make the most of it while you are there and study the management style. Bezos is not an idiot. It's  brutal and impersonal. The system self perpetuates, so no matter where you go in the network, it's the same. Good luck!"
good,I personally think that the organization in the building needs work. With different shift changes and the etiquette of the building as far as bin cleanliness goes. It is not a bad place work at all.
good,"good job for peoples wich just came to uk,targets was too big to achive for normal peoples, without air conditioning all summerswas like a horror"
good,They are willing to train anybody on just about anything in the warehouse. Management doesn't really listen to their employees very well.
good,"amazon is a great place to work with some benefits and compensation to go with(401k,health insurance,carrer choice etc. good management and a very productive company."
good,"amazon is a great place to work,good working environment, benefits and various compensation like 401k,health plan, carrer choice.productive and fun work place"
good,"Very hard work, but that's not a big deal to me. They often talk about how they are the most customer-centric company on Earth, and it appears that is true, even at the cost of their employees. Turn-over rate is sky high. We're #1 in the world for productivity, but 2nd to last in safety (wonder if those are correlated?). You're given lots of ways to make a problem known, but the odds of something actually being done about that problem are slim to none. Sometimes this is simply because managers have their hands tied by their superiors, and sometimes is just because they don't care or don't understand."
good,Never really know what you'll be doing in a day because you're a warehouse associate. Everyone is easy to get a long with. The people I work with make my job enjoyable.
good,"It was an ok place, a better place for someone starting out of college.  It was a 50+/week day, learned a lot and some managers were leader and some were not."
good,"I was process instructor I have had a great time to train new hires in Amazon. My L&D manager always feedback me, that was great support , I could correct my mistakes and time to time I was better and better."
good,"work hard "
good,"my work day starts at 7:30 am, go to my station, and work until 9:30 am, we go to break for only ten minutes (its supposed to be 15 mins break but it takes five minutes to go to the break room and come back to the station) work until 12 go to lunch for half an hour and come back to work, second break is at 3 pm until 3:15 pm and get out at 6 pm"
good,"fast paced environment, break time says it's 15 minutes but it's really 10 minutes. There is a new rule in the building everyday. there's really no social life if you work nights."
good,"talk to international customers..learned to type faster.management is good.co workers were ok. staying awake and getting ready for work after not being able to sleep during the day in summer."
good,"I would not suggest staying here for long, it will make you go crazy. Overall though it is a good place to start for someone who isn't sure where to start..."
good,"It's an okay job, but not something I'd try to make a career out of. The management expects so much from you when they barely do anything."
good,"Its shift begin at 8 am and end by 5pm."
good,My supervisor was soo racist and he didnt properly train me well and he got me fired after 2 weeks of employment just because of a counting error
good,"très bon management, très compétiteur."
good,Benefits are really good. Job experiences depends on every single individual. They ave food free almost every quarter and peak season is a good time to pick a prize. Best wishes
good,"When I started I had all the motivation in the world and moved up quick, but the job is miserable on all accounts and the treatment is the reason for that"
good,The management team that I worked under was very hard to deal with due to clashing ideals between the managers. One was very willing to help out as much as he could to make sure the job was getting done. The other manager was very rude to the other employees and managers and she pushed everyone one around and made it a priority to make sure we all knew she was better than us.
good,"I was able to have positions in ICQA and Inbound processing at Amazon. Work was hard and pay was fair, but you had no room for personal life over peak periods; which included Christmas."
good,"I have been with Amazon for 5.5 years. It is the type of company that requires a lot out of you and does not give a lot back. I am a very hard worker but, when you bend and break for a company that does not see it, it makes you feel very unappreciated. The culture and moral at Amazon is a lot lower then a company of this magnitude should be at. The managers act like they care and listen to the associates but, in the long run its what is best for them. The work is definitely hard which I like, I love the fast pace environment but it wares down on you after a while. The pay is respectable which a lot of the associates do not seem to grasp. Other then that its reall just an ""OK"" place to work at."
good,i was working in picking department . the work was quite easy but as we had to work 9 hrs a day and 6 days a week it was very exhausting. otherwise everything was okay.
good,"Good job that offers quick money source.  However, job security isn't the best due to rate per hour performance reviews of employees by management.  A typical day includes having a team meeting at the start of shift.  Employees disburse to their assignments: picking or packing.  Breaks are short: ten minutes and lunch is twenty-five minutes.  Each session includes a five minute walk to the breakroom.  Normally, ten hour shifts are worked.  I've learned to move from one side of the distribution center to the furthest using an OP Truck.  This machine allows employees to lift as high as 40 feet in the air to retrieve products for the customer.  My co-workers vary.  They are comprised of different age levels, educational levels, and nationalities.  The hardest part of the job is staying focused to make the hourly rate expected of you by management; again we're talking about hitting the numbers for ten hours straight.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me is payday."
good,"In general a pretty great place to work , decent compensation with advancement opportunities.  I came in as an entry level associate and am now in a teir 3 postion auditing the different departments in the building. The main draw back it the peak scheduling and the fact that I am also on night shift. "
good,"Days consisted of picking and packing, it taught me how to do that, management were alright, have I wrote enough words yetttsg sdhbdj dfjhbdfj fdjhfsenhjfe hnh ej nfjf hnd"
good,"A typical day at work begins with stand-up in your department. This includes announcements, reminders of standard work, safety, various department/facility news bits, and stretching exercises. After this is concluded, you have a set amount of time to get to your station and/or starting place in the mods (no more than 10 minutes, if you're lucky) and begin your work. Management keeps almost obsessive track of your time on task, and will be after you if you exceed a certain amount, breaks not included."
good,"A typical work day requires me to walk as fast as I can for 10 hours a day with basically two five minute breaks throughout the day. I had to maintain 100 units per hour, going from one side of 1.7 million square feet building to the other."
good,"A typical day at work is very busy. I am constantly scanning and receiving items and ensuring they are in the correct condition in order to dispatch them to the next department. I learnt how to improve my ICT and numeracy skills. It also allows me to adapt on my communication skills and how to use machinery in a health and safety aspect. I work well with my managers, which in orders me to go to them for advice. They encourage me on doing my best when working on shop floor and helping me reach my targets. I also consider myself as a team member as in this place of work, team skills are vital. Amazon is such a world wide company, it makes my job difficult as some of the products are in different languages. I struggle with reading the labels attached to the items delivered. The most enjoyable part about my job is that everyday is different. It gives me a chance to learn new skills and adapt on different challenges."
good,"First swipe your badge five minutes before starting shift, stretching exercises before starting the work shift and being informed about new procedures, policies, safety requirements.  I personally worked in the packaging department, sort department and then the outbound ship department.  Like working in grand central station extremely busy environment of which I liked. Scanned material throughout the day, sorted items, inspected products to make sure in good condition before shipping out to customers.  Two breaks for the day one in the morning and one in the afternoon.  Also swipe badge go for a half hour for lunch then back to work. Most of the work crew would work together toward the set goals for each day. Time elements must be met for shipping out to customers and must be in good quality. Rotation of workers is essential  in each department if cross trained in those departments.  I enjoyed the cross training and the people I worked with. It is vital to enjoy the job you are doing and to have fun at the workplace too. After meeting the goals of scanning, sorting, and shipping the items out pretty much the day is over and then you swipe your badge before leaving the building."
good,"This job was a very face paced job, but often times double work would be pushed on its workers. I will say the job was easy to learn how to do."
good,"I enjoyed my nearly two year tenure at Amazon but what I came to realize that it is an environment that is not for the family oriented, weak hearted, or anyone who enjoys having a life outside of their work environment. Big projects mean long hours, but the work provided is mentally challenging and forces you to grow in all ways to meet your role. There is a future here for those who do not have many obligations outside of work, and who are interested in being apart of something new and exciting. I worked in advertising so the work was a bit mundane and repetitious but there are other organizations who are changing the way companies of this scale, think and disseminate information."
good,"Amazon is a factory so the environment is very fast paced. Everyone takes breaks and lunches at the same time. In the morning, everyone huddles to discuss sales from the previous day and goals for that day. While working, each employee has a station with a computer and several different bins. As a customer returns processor, you inspect each product and determine whether it is re-sellable or not. After the decision has been made, it is placed into the corresponding bin where it travels down the conveyor belt to its designated location."
good,"I got on with Amazon before they even finished putting everything in place. Those few early weeks allowed us to learn several different jobs in testing out the systems before they officially opened. The atmosphere was great, and all the managers were excited about it getting up going. The closer it got to opening and running at full systems the more pumped up they got, and the more they had us pumped up for it. However it would turn out that they do that every time the holiday season comes around, but it would quickly fade from all that. I managed to make it on to the problem solve team which meant we did have the expectations of pulling or packing a set number of items in a certain amount of time. We were responsible for  making sure 100% of packages left on time, and we were the best team at it. Once the holidays ended and things started to slow down is when the inexperience of the management team many straight out of college with no experience or even degrees in management began to show. It quickly became a contest of who could kiss up the most,and that even weighed on promotions if you wanted to move up. I ended up getting put in pack were the goals you're required to hit are really only achievable by nearly running yourself to death to keep those numbers up. Because of this when I got a bit of a sinus infection I ended up running myself ragged till I got sick one day.After that they refused to put me back in pack or anywhere else till I got a doctors note saying what I could and couldn't do. So until I got the note I was helping out with the training team till HR discovered"
good,"Unless you have a bachelor's, don't expect to get a decent paying position for the amount of work that is expected of you.  However, Amazon employment is looked upon favorably by other warehouses, so you can expect your future job hunting endeavors to be successful."
good,"•Develop and monitor Trailer pool requirements and coordinate requirements with carriers"
good,"Amazon was a great place to work , the pay was awesome staff was too. Being paid weekly was an enjoyment of mines. Amazon didn't really care about me as individual and my personal needs but overall a good company that I received great pay."
good,Amazon culture is good and its a good place to work with. Enjoy the time I spent with it. Fun place to work and the people are the best in business.
good,"this is a great job to get your feet off the ground however . you get paid to be there . not for your attitude or productivity. if you work harder than the rest, don’t expect more from the company. everyone gets the same pay"
good,Very busy work environment. First priority as a team and individually is metrics driven and second priority is process improvements. Team and Leads are very supportive and thrive off of leadership principles .
good,long hours with short lunch. long periods of working without breaks. no mats on concrete floors. pushes employees really hard to work as fast as possible.
good,continuous work flow constant change in work enviroment. With the changing of the management it can be hard at times to establish one self new managers new rules and change of work processes
good,"Job is simple enough with pretty good benefits. I like the vision plan and the pay is good enough for my life requirements,"
good,"Long and often tiring work (12hrs/day, 4-5days/wk) with good weekly pay.  Learned to work efficiently for long periods of time and make sure a full system of people working in an assembly line worked smoothly."
good,"Great place with opportunities and great co-workers but the workload at this place can be very repetitive and will drive a normal person insane. I am use to the fast pace, on the move kind of jobs and if you are too then this job is not for you. If you do consider working here just be ready to stand at the same spot doing the same thing for 10 hours!"
good,Hard work and hard on your body. This job is not a career. No room for advancement. Good money for a short time. 10 hour shifts
good,long hours. you can't move from your station even if you have no work to do. Management tells you different things all the time. No consistency. standing on your feet all day long
good,I learned a lot in this position. It is a very busy job that I enjoyed. The hardest part was commuting when the weather was bad.
good,"Shifts are good.  Work isn't that hard, but you do work.  Pay and benefits are decent.  You are on your feet for 10-11 hours a day.  Shifts are 4 days a week 10 hour days, with the exception of overtime."
good,"Play the game, mind your business and you will be fine. "
good,"In my particular building we had to work a lot of mandatory overtime, 11 hour shifts, and the work is intense. I have a family so this just did not work for me. They need improvement in how employees are treated by some managers, but its a company where you can grow."
good,"A very fast paced company, built around customer experience and productivity.  Amazon as a company has a very aggressive and competitive work style."
good,"Grabbing a cart filled with totes that are filled with items, take the cart to an ill and begin scanning the items and placing them on shelf's that have enough space to place the items on."
good,"Amazon is a fast growing company.  You are surrounded by smart people everyday, there's definitely a lot to learn.  But it's hard to find work life balance."
good,"That is still true. However, over the last few years management has lost its way. Amazon's previously stellar culture has become something more akin to Microsoft's. It is a sad thing to see."
good,"5 senior QAs were hired for 3 month before the first Kindle release and nobody got an offer..."
good,the typical work day at Amazon warehouse was always very long and very fast paced. The typical day was different day to day sometimes good sometimes bad.
good,"A great place to meet people and make ends meet, but don't get your hopes up when trying to advance within company. Show favoritism and management likes to make promises they can't keep."
good,"The days are long working in an Amazon Fulfillment Center. 10 hour days, 4 days a week. The work itself is always one of two extremes, fast or boring. Management is generally sub-par, but the pay and benefits are nice."
good,It was a technical risk investigator job. My job was to put fraud at bay from the site. It had its perks but it was also monotonous.
good,It was great working with a recognizable brand and a team but the downfall was that you only worked on ebanners and had too many brand guidelines to follow. You could not be free and design what you think works well and there was no appreciation of what you did.
good,didn't really had a chance to work cause of car pooling heard its a lot of running and no play time at all 2 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute break strong security other then that just be ready for the hours and speeding paces.
good,"Typical day included arriving an hour before shift to plan staffing and goals, start the shift, track production and remove barriers making adjustment throughout the shift, then staying an hour past shift to write shift summary. My co-workers were very friendly and fun to work with. Hardest part of the job was getting clear communication from our Leadership Team. The most enjoyable part of my job was engaging with my team."
good,"Serviço bem aprimorado, porém o salário não corresponde com as responsabilidades exigidas em certas profissões dentro da empresa."
good,"Leadership is out of touch with workforce and had challenges aligning their objectives with the feedback they received from their employees. Workaholic culture erodes employee retention and I saw many come and go who were disenchanted after a brief period of time. It's a shame as they hire great people, but keeping them around was a challenge."
good,"Work hard, Play hard, make history. Unfortunately pay is horrible from a grown up. And the raises are a joke. Good starter job for kids coming out of high school,"
good,Job requires a lot of walking which can be very strenuous on your back...the warehouse is very large and you are required to cover a large amount of area in a short amount of time
good,"The pace and expectations are not something that anyone would like to have as a permanent occupation. Advancement is limited. Management changes constantly, but is usually just moved around so no advancement. The BEST part is the amount of time off. The WORST part is the demanding nature and lack of acknowledgement."
good,A typical day was 10 hours of handling product in some form  or another.  Great coworkers poor management.  A lot of moving around and lifting.
good,"Long hours"
good,Was only seasonal for me. would have been nice if could have gotten more hours. Will try again when the new building opens
good,"I been with the company for six months seen a lot of favoritism and a bunch of B.S. reasons why you weren't choose for postion. My main job is to stand in 3x5 area looking at a screen and scanning products into pod or mobile shelf on a robot for ten hours if lucky not be asked if you want take volunteer time off. Because of lack work don't bother asking to be cross - training lead to empty promises and you're stuck on the schedule they give you specify Fri-mon on nights "
good,"Pressure is high, work hours are long, and work-life balance doesn't exist.  However, your colleagues are bright, competitive and working on changing the world.  It is a good learning experience but not a place you can work forever."
good,"Inventory Control and a COACH for new associates. Worked on a production line. Forklift operator. Load / unload trailers."
good,prepping orders to be shipped in to Amazon warehouses. I have learned a lot about how to start and Amazon business of my own. I dont see others much as I work at night and am the only one that does. Lifting heavy boxes and I enjoy having my own schedule.
good,"A typical night at Amazon Fulfillment consists of me picking customer orders for 10 hours a day, with two 15-minute ""scan-to-scan"" paid breaks and one 30 minute unpaid lunch break. I learned how to do almost everything in the outbound department. The hardest part of the job is the constant walking and keeping a good pace to maintain work rate. The most enjoyable part of my job would be getting the opportunity to learn different departments. Management and co-workers really make the warehouse thriving work environment."
good,"amazon was a good job."
good,"Der typische Tag beginnt mit einem Meeting, das 2 Minuten dauert. Der Manager gibt beim Meeting Safety-Tipps. "
good,this is tiring you always on your feet all day with little short breaks. I was exhausted everyday. they are really petty over every little thing
good,"Amazon is a great place to work and it was really fun learning and being trained in the different departments. My coworkers and I built friendships that I'll have even after leaving, and my managers were almost always available to talk to.  The only problem I had with the company it that the managers were not very organized and didn't communicate well with each other, you could ask the same question to three different managers and get three different answers from each with would cause major confusion."
good,"Boring work environment"
good,"Receive orders from trucks inspecting each item for damage, quality verifying description and barcodes match, whether receiving items for inventory, stowing into bins for pick, picking for customer orders, or packing customer orders."
good,I already wrote a review on this. The very first review I wrote is about Amazon. Great place to be if you don't go through ISS.
good,no work life balance. be prepared to work weekends and nights. poor people management. everything is a fire drill. hair on fire environment. pay is good.
good,"This is a great seasonal job opportunity, but beyond that this job is a dead end. Communication between management and staff is minimal. If you don't mind walking an average of 12 miles a day with constant bending over this job is easy and enjoyable. Management after 3 years of service makes a max of $15/hr. 40 hour weeks are common with good chance of overtime."
good,The hardest part about working at Amazon was maintain your pick speed. I enjoyed interacting with the different departments. I learned a lot about the merchandise that Amazon ships out.
good,It use to be a fun place to work but management changes so much that you cant really get use to anything but it is a pretty easy place to work nothing is really hard but it is just a job and not a career.
good,"Amazon pays the skilled trades well if you have good skills.benefits are good.Working conditions are good , sometimes chaos when busy."
good,"It pays great, the hours will cause a married man to become a divorced one, you work on some of the most innovative projects around but, the bar is insanely high."
good,"Long, hard and demanding hours. Not as difficult as everyone makes it but it's not a breeze either. Hard work with Amazon does pay off."
good,"I support nearly every move that was made at the Amazon sites where I worked for 4 years.  Daily I would motivate teams, hit production goals, and find ways to eliminate waste through process improvements.  The one downside is that there is a high dose of micromanagement by the building leaders, and having backbone is preached but not well responded to by members of authority.  My peers were great, and Amazon typically hires great managers.   The hardest part about the job is managing stress and being told to complete conflicting goals. ""Make the work better"" but you can't change that process.  ""Try something""  but don't do that that won't work.  ""Your team is not performing like the other shifts"" but they have only been hired for 2 days.  All in all it is a great place to work for a few years.  Go in to it knowing what it is.  There is little chance for a life 3 months of the year, you will work long hours every day, and you will be on your feed all day for 12 hours 4 days a week."
good,"Okay place to work for a short while, If you're looking for long time work I would suggest to keep looking. Very political place of employment"
good,"A typical day at work would inclued collecting the returned items and reading the reason why the item has been returned on a computer and if dammaged I would authorised a refund to the coustomer,"
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Amazon but I did not feel that Amazon was a long-term career for me. The main reason is that Seattle is too far from home and there are no opportunities to relocate to my hometown with Amazon. The second reason is that the work/life balance can be extremely challenging, especially during Peak. I have always worked hard and put in the hours but Amazon was on another level - a level I was not willing to commit to for the long-term."
good,"While working from home would seem like  a dream, I felt the isolation of the situation was to much. Amazon did very little in the way of trying to create a culture to give the employee stability.Most mornings there were no managers available. It was difficult to get anyone on the line if you were having computer issues.If you had to wait for IT , you were to clock out and that time was logged against you, even though you were to stay at you computer on hold with Amazon till a technical rep was available. I enjoyed the job , but the isolation and policies such as the one I mentioned took away from the position."
good,"Amazon is a good company and does pay well, however an employee never knows if they are going to have a job or not everyday they come in. Management does not stand behind their employees and most co-workers are out for themselves."
good,"Putting the customer's orders into totes, and sending them down a conveyor belt. I learned about teamwork, responsibility, and time management. Most of the management did not seem to be prepared to fulfill their goals; nor did they seem to care about their associates. However, there were some managers that went out of their way for their associates. My co-workers were like a family to me! Even if we had never spoken to each other before it seemed like I could get along with anyone. The hardest part of this job was the working conditions and rate. Sometimes items would fall out of the bins and even onto people. Pickers would have obstacles they couldn't over come, but would often still be punished for not meeting standards. My favorite part of this job was definitely the people I had the pleasure of meeting!"
good,"The company sells everything under the sun and gets it to you quickly. Prices are reasonable and so is shipping. This is one of the most unique places I've ever been employed. It's a different culture, they think outside the box and it has brought a great diversity of people and technologies together. There are many good people who work at Amazon. "
good,Years of working in a warehouse environment I would say it was fun at first.  When management started to change the fun that we all had was removed.
good,"typical day was 10 hour shifts at night cold and tiring"
good,"Fun environment to work, should be more flexible but management is over bearing and inconsistent."
good,overall great work place. learned how to drive forklifts and how to receive inventory in and push orders out.
good,"Amazon is not a bad place to work when it comes to the money. Every weekend I went to work at 7:45 till 6:15. My usual day is standing at a work station and pack boxes for around 10 hours. The managers there are not too bad, but do tend to look down to you. Depending where you are stationed, there will be no time to communicate with co-workers and other times you will be able to work with them, depending on the job. The most difficult part of the job is the fact that you are not allowed to exercise your legs after standing in the same place for so long as this will affect your targets and may get you a warning. The best part of the job would be the boost of confidence you achieve when you know you have hit the expected target."
good,Good Office Facilities with lots of benefits. Long working hours with little work/life balance. Work requires decision makers and people willing to take risk.
good,"Great place to work for a few years, but depending on the group you're in, you could burn out quickly."
good,"I was inside an warehouse most of the day and never saw day light, especially in the winter in Phoenix, AZ."
good,I love working for Amazon but the communication with management is horrible. Management doesn't communicate with each other or the associates on new processes or changes in the building at all. I learned a lot of different processes and been cross trained from bringing in inventory to shipping out customers product.
good,this was a warehouse seasonal position I always made my numbers
good,walk for ten hours different task picking shipping stowing helping new associates learn the job
good,"Standing consistently moving and working. While their I learned how to operate different PIT Equipment, Computers and Scanners. Depending on the job assignment they are very easy going and understanding toward various circumstances. Hard workers and good team workers. Standing the whole shift and bi- weekly pay periods. My co- workers."
good,"As far as benefits, and compensation, Amazon was amazing to work for. But they have entirely to many people in managers positions,  which makes it really difficult to know where to receive instructions. and there are not nearly enough breaks."
good,worked with nice co-workers. Liked the management of the company.
good,"HORAIRES:"
good,"Enjoyable place to work with plenty of interesting colleagues from all walks of life.a typical day was much like any other day clock in,have brief then pretty much left on your own to do your work.most managers/team leaders were approachable, your co-associates were kept you going whilst working,toughest part of the job was the amount of walking and sometimes the way things were done..."
good,"come in get your scanner ,stand up and hear a meeting about the job .didn't learn a lot cause I am us to working hard and I am fast learner . management was lousy , co workers were great .the hardest part of the job was the place hot from the time I got there till the time the shift ended. enjoyable part was the workers we got the job done"
good,"Amazon offered some amazing things at orientation that had everyone excited and extremely thankful for their position. Personal Time/Vacation accruals bi-weekly, opportunities to cross-train, and much much more. But the company is focused on rates, it is never good enough for them. They took away bi-weekly accruals and gave us ONCE a year lump sum of 48 hours. If I could go back, I wouldn't have taken the job."
good,I was top packer and KO and did not receive compensation nor encouragement from Management. Co workers were friendly
good,"you have to have the energy for this environment, basic training, but it would be better if they was more specific"
good,Working amazon a typical day working is making sure the counts are down and inventory is right in the computer so you can get the item out to the customer
good,I love my job and I am very dedicated. I have noticed alot of favoritism towards new hires that are friends with management. I have worked very hard for the past 3 and a half years to be forgotten about and positions taken by new hires that are friends with managment. I need to find a new job with carreer advancement without favoritism.
good,"Ensuring customer orders are sent out on time, fixing any issues that may occur, training other associates on different processes."
good,"working at amazon can be hard at times as it is very demanding but i feel i do not get paid enough for the amount of work i do as a team leader i am always in 1 hour early and only get paid for 15 minutes before my shift and 15 after im always first in and last to leave."
good,Blah it was okay.  Enjoyed the work environment.Great people to work with always fun.
good,"Learned how to be professional, worked for 9 hours in a day and used to stretch 2 hours extra whenever there was business requirement ."
good,"Amazon fulfillment is a typical production/warehousing atmosphere but with an insane amount of SKU variation which makes the way they conduct their operations very ""peculiar"". The Area Manager role effectively manages anywhere between 25 to over 120 warehouse associates, making it a very challenging and rewarding experience. "
good,"After reading these reviews, I'm wondering if this is the same Amazon I work at.  Many there came from much higher paying jobs but the recession put us in positions to take what we can.  I took a 50% cut in pay and work harder than I ever have.  I work 10 hour days, 6:30pm to 5:00am.  and during peak season, 50 to 60 hours a week.  During peak, I didn't have a single day that I didn't have to go to or return from work.  I normally work Wednesday through Saturday so that means I get home Sunday morning...no time for family or friends. Monday and Tuesday, my days off, everyone is at work. At times, they throw a wrench in the schedule and tell us we have mandatory overtime. I've been trying to change my schedule but I'm told they need to find someone to fill my time slot....noboby in their right mind would  want this shift.  I should add that I had a nice, cushy office job and had never worked in a warehouse until now. I now have a greater appreciation for all service workers, clerks and checkers who stand on their feet all day."
good,"Disconnect between management and associates. The rate system is not consistent, many of the rules here do not seem to make sense."
good,sorting and parking customer orders on conveyors and using computer
good,"Not in the same area everyday, work 10hours a day sunday-wed, love my co-workers very nice, hardest part of my job is standing in one spot for 10 hours. The most enjoyable part I look forward is getting my 3 days off from work."
good,"La mia tipica giornata lavorativa partiva dalle 8/9 ore al giorno con uno o due giorni di riposo a settimana, era molto stancante perchè camminavi tutto il giorno e quasi non ti potevi fermare un attimo... l' unica cosa che ho imparato è il lavoro di squadra. L'organizzazione non era delle migliori, perchè ogni giorno c era sempre un problema, ma se la sono sempre cavata."
good,nights is horrible but they cant do enough for you make you feel like a family really nice place to work
good,"The environment promotes a very healthy attitude of work hard play hard.  "
good,"Start the day with a short meeting and stretching.  Login to your scanner and get to work.  Work entails following locations provided by the scanner to find the next item to pick.  That location might be right next to you or 200 feet away.  It is your responsibility to make rate no matter how far apart your picks may be.  There is no consideration given to obstacles.  You must make rate."
good,Warehouse was very large and had hundreds of employees. A typical day I would stow 2000-3000 items and work 12 hours. The hardest of the job was the 12 hours.The most enjoyable part of the job was the paycheck and the people.
good,"Amazon is a good place to work if you have a degree and a lot of experience. If you are a entry level worker, you will be treated like a robot. Many people come and go on a daily basis. The starting wage is only $11.00 per hour. Add insurance and 401K and you are left with almost nothing."
good,Its a good place to learn many things. We can have fun at the same time enjoy work.
good,"I had a very bad experience as a software developer in the supply chain department. Almost non-existent management, and the developers had too much power. I don't know anyone who loves working at Amazon, but most people I know had a better experience than me."
good,I am looking for a long term career in customer service industry where in I can utilise my knowledge and skills to resolve the customer's issues and keep the satisfied.
good,"I've heard that some of the culture in the Merchant Risk Department has changed since I left, but when I left there was a performance evaluation system in place that was not only inaccurate and inconsistent but served to create a hostile work environment in which the employee is constantly in a state of anxiety over their work.  Effective workers need to feel confident in their work.  Constructive criticism is important to any dynamic work environment, but it needs to be consistent, appropriately delivered, and scheduled regularly or it loses effectiveness and the workers feel devalued. "
good,Amazon India is a great place to learn for someone who is interested in improving their career. Its the employee who works towards making their careers.
good,going to work pack merchandise ship them to customer and alot of safety.
good,"The work we do is exciting and enjoyable, therefore meeting our goals is a cake walk. Everyday we work, we learn a lot of new stuff. There's a good scope of improvising and every innovative idea which is good for the business is greatly welcome and appreciated. Everything related to work is good except>"
good,A typical day at work: Multiple task in a fast pace environment.
good,"Amazon was a great place to work whilst in the building, I enjoyed my job very much. However there was no job security what so ever. Although I knew it was only a temporary position, they are severely strict on all employees. For example: While working there I had a Chest Infecton, a Kidney Infection, the Flu, and also broke my ribs and was told I couldnt even take a day off to go the hospital to get them checked. So after finishing work at 9pm I then had to book a late night hospital appointment at st Johns to be checked over and given Anti Biotics. I also had to travel home to Livingston before I could book this appointment meaning it was aftet11pm. So i would NOT reccommend working for Amazon CS.!"
good,Typical day at work consisted of 8-12 hours of standing bending and walking while completing different warehouse task. I Learned that in a busy warehouse setting that
good,Lots of walking. Learned how to receive and send out shipments.
good,"Amazon is a good place to work. I have met new people and gained new friends. I have learned new skills, such as productivity and how to take inventory. It also taught me how to be more of a team player. The hardest part of my job is not knowing if I am going to have a fulltime permanent position within the company, since I am a temp to hire employee and there really is no communication with the managers and the temp employees."
good,"Overall Amazon I found where hard and difficult to work for but,"
good,Make sure you ask about oncall duty. Even software developers need to carry a pager all the time. And it's not a fun thing when you get paged several times per night.
good,Hated working the night shift and day shift
good,"Worst micromanaged environment. Opportunities are plentiful, but too much bureaucracy"
good,If you live to work you will love it. Work life balance non-existent.
good,"Work and no play all day. I go to work stand in the same spot for 8 to 9 hours each day. We get three breaks, one thirty minutes unpaided lunch and two fifteen minutes break. I receive items, scan the items, count the items, put the items in a tote after receiving the items and then i send the items to another department to be stowed."
good,"A typical day you clock in then you go to your stand up area for your first half meeting. Yours second half meeting is after lunch. I learned the warehouse business. Great place to start for your first warehouse job. Management can be uneasy, tends to go for the associates who are outgoing. The hardest part of the job will be working walking for ten hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is fullfilling the customers order."
good,"A typical day at the Amazon warehouse included daily stretching with my peers and working to meet the night's goals. The members of the management team were very good at encouraging us through the shift and rewarding us for meeting quotas. The hardest part of working at Amazon was the mandatory 11 hour night shifts, but it was also the most enjoyable because we were all excited to work hard and meet all of our goals before our time ran out."
good,"Its a Job, but not one that you could turn into a career, most don't get noticed let alone promoted. The pay is good and decent benifits"
good,"Taeglich habe ich einige bestimmte Zustaedigkeiten, die ich erfolgreich abschliessen muss. Ausserdem muss ich mich mit unserem Kunden in Verbindung, wenn Ihre Datei per Amazon Standards nicht ist. Hier habe ich viel Erfahrung bei MS Excel und effektive Kunden Kommunikation gesammelt. Ich kann meine Zeit gut verwalten."
good,"a typical day at amazon.com is always moving always pushing for a new record. go go go never stop. i have learned to keep a mind set that helps the day run smooth and the hours go by all the while making great numbers and doing a safe job. the managment needs a little work as they are not very visible to the associate. a good manager needs to be somewhat interactive with there workers in my opinion. the people i work with are great, we have all been there for numerous years so we all know what the others are able to accel in, but when a new hire is introduced into the department everyone is very eager to help that person strive for succes. the hardest part of my job is trying keep up with the amount of movement from department to department throughout the day, but this is only for a need by need basis. the most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that someone out there will be receivin the package that i just packed and shipped. hoping that all the hard work might pay off in a smile in someone else."
good,"Working at Amazon has been an okay experience. I have been with the company as an entry level contractor for the past 3.5 months thus far. As a contractor, you of course, get no benefits. But it would be extremely helpful if they provided a bus pass or parking since it is very expensive to park in the Seattle metropolitan area. The atmosphere you get as a contractor is very competitive and management definitely has favorites, thus there is a lot of politics. However, there is hardly any micromanagement, which leaves a lot of flexibility with scheduling and without the feeling of someone always looking over your shoulder. Advancement is pretty challenging as a contractor since they generally hire you with the intent for you as a temp - nothing more. This makes its hard to go into the company and then move up the corporate ladder. As contractor, your work life balance is pretty good. You get your 8 hours in and you're out. They don't want to pay OT, so they make it so you have to get approval if you want OT. This is great for work life balance. But as a permanent employee, this is absolutely the opposite."
good,you make alot of money here but then your laid off for working too hard
good,i didnt have the best of experience because i felt i was just thrown onto a working line with no instruction as what to do.
good,Não tinha colegas de trabalho era somente eu e o meu patrão.
good,"Um bom ambiente de trabalho, o unico problema que é colocado muito carro na area Vip, assim exige mais atenção, sendo que deveria ter um limite de lotação."
good,"Good job. Decent days off, but the temp to hire takes 10 months and its only sooner if you actually know somebody."
good,working at amazon can be fun but it is very tough on your body your on your feet for 10 hours constantly and lifting heavy boxes
good,• Customer Service
good,day starts with morning meeting and strectches. I go to my assigned station and if all is prepared I start my day. Management changed frequently due to promotions and transfers. they were not as open to new ideas as purported. Environment is micro-managed. Too many bosses so they atmosphere is very bureacratic. Takes too long to get approval for simple things.
good,When you first arrive for your shift we do what we call 'Stand Up'. It's stretching exercises and then we talk about the reviews from other shifts and the previous day. We talk about our goals for our shift and what is expected out of the employees. We then pick up our duties for the shift and start our work. I myself drove an order picker. I was what was called a picker. I went throughout the warehouse picking up orders that needed to be shipped out to the customers. I located and obtained the orders and dropped them off in their designated areas so that they could be packaged and shipped out to their appropriate locations.
good,The shift timings are good 8 to 5. Place where you can tell its the survival of the fittest. Can keep learning.. learning and learning in Amazon
good,"Work was moderate we have breaks every couple of hours and a nice break room, lots of space. Management was very nice, when u needed little stuff they were on top if it. But other then that would send you to HR. The hardest part was working 3rd shift 6pm to 5am and the most enjoyable part was the people who worked there."
good,"Productive workplace with worldclass reputation. Unfortunately, I've found this opportunity to be more of a job versus a career opportunity. My personal goals have been achieved but now seeking outside career opportunities. Hardest part of decision is leaving manager who generally puts employees first."
good,"Amazon is a good place to work but is hard going sometimes with only a half hour break in 8 hour day. I will credit Amazon as I have worked my way up and improved my IT skills within Amazon which is a fantastic opportunity. The management is brilliant and the team I work with are amazing. Plenty of benefits/discounts within Amazon but could do with a few more ""local"" benefits/discounts."
good,The job was very tiring after weeks and weeks of working there. Though it gets easier as the more time goes by.
good,Company moves very fast offering many opportunities for growth
good,"A typical day at amazon, will be get in the system, then do what the system says, I've learned to do an organized job with caution and quality, my co-workers usually are tired to socialize with others.. that makes me feel sad :( the hardest part of the job is to achieve my rate, and the most enjoyable part of the job is when my manager comes to me and say: ""pretty good job Sonia"""
good,"The management is almost non existent, there is no supervision at the sites, the management is hard to get incontact with. A lot of workers don't follow policies   , no motivation with some workers, when some people try to motivate other workers, you get written up. Needs to be overhauled. The IT'S need to be up graded."
good,Lots to do. The hardest part of the job is picking and staging. Expect to be sore. Make sure that you remember to lift with your legs not your back. Politics.
good,"I worked at Amazon for a short period of time.  During my experience I had a good schedule and was able to use my past experience at UPS to utilize it at Amazon"
good,I enjoyed working with the customers and the management was very supportive. The hours were tolerable but the starting salary is very low even at $15 per hour and the benefits are very expensive and they could make it easier to advance to better paying positions within the company.
good,"samostatnosti, ochoty se učit novem vecem, "
good,"good company to work for hard but fair,great parking and easy to find,you work 4 days on 3 off which helps with your home and private life,lots of chances for training"
good,"Good job, great pay and benefits but no job security. Kind of reminds me of a high school atmosphere, people are very cliquey and management plays favorites."
good,"It's all about the bottom line, employees are expendable. They are constantly pushing people to do more when there are other people who don't have the numbers but are not reprimanded."
good,"It was cool and pay during peak hours was good. I took the job because i was going to school. The people i worked with were ok. i do think that the pay needs to be increased and more PTO needs to be given. But it wasn't a bad place to work. for standing between 10-12 hours all day, they need definitely need to increase the pay."
good,"It has been a few years since I worked at Amazon,  I don't have a negative or a positive experience for this company.  It was different from any other job I have had."
good,"Due to the long hours of standing, it can get tiring. Breaks are to short and should be much longer. "
good,"This job pays well and offer useful things, like free hot beverage machines and cheap travel.It is a clean work environment and has friendly people working there."
good,Environnement convivial et agréable à travailler. Pas de difficulté particulière car la formation est très compréhensive et le travail demandé  est accessible à tous.
good,It was an alright place to work .i liked the pay and all you just have a hard time if you get injured they want you to keep working even if it makes your injury worse
good,Can be a fun place to work. I met some nice people there. I do not know what else to say but this will not let me continue without putting in at least 150 characters.
good,You will be moving 8 hrs a day constantly with barely rest. Managers only care about your rate and definitely have favorites. If your rate is good you will be a favorite.
good,Works good when they give you it  you work on a rotation and night shift the move the start and finish time to suit them selfs you hardly ever finish on time
good,"Le travail peut être bien ou moins bien selon le poste que l'on pratique, sur certains postes une pression est présente à cause de la production."
good,"HUGE place, clean secure car park which is also huge, regarding the work it really depends if you have the stamina or not because it's not easy, a lot of physical movement is part and parcel of this job, money is okayish i guess, £9.50 per hr, would only recommend this job if you are a gym freak, it'll save you shhit loads on your membership"
good,From where I began as an OMR it had great comp compared to the area I lived. However proper comp as I advanced lacked. Lots of opportunities for relo.
good,Productivity and safety is prioritized at all times. There is opportunity for growth within some departments more than others. Company can do better by reducing high employee turn over.
good,"Paid weekly as a sales associate at whole foods market. Have to be willing to walk around the store quick to pick and scan items to place into bag. Honestly, we don't get paid enough."
good,Fast pace and not very family oriented good pay guaranteed hours during the week worked there three years and then resigned relocated tried again didn't like distance
good,I was there on a temporary assignment at their peak time of the year. We were required to work 10 hr shifts and 60 hr weeks. Way to long to be standing on your feet packing boxes as fast as you can. I hated it.
good,"I used to receive and processing incoming stock, stowing and splitting materials, picking and filling orders from stock.  I have outstanding organizational abilities"
good,"I don't blame them for still being at a ""working out the kinks phase"" over at Amazon Logistics with the Breakaway Courier group.  It was a great place to earn a living.  I'd imagine things have to be more organized by now."
good,"Physically, it’s a difficult job and perfect if you don’t want to talk to anyone all day. Benefits are good, wages are fair. Lots of rules to abide by, and sometimes very long hours"
good,It's a large company and your life can be completely different from one group to another. Good training opportunities. Lots of smart people. Over the last few years I saw telecommuting opportunities going away. Very difficult to get promoted and almost impossible to get your comp significantly increased.
good,Very chill steady pace environment great company overall just the AM’s there have no type of sympathy for their employees nd their personal lives as parents
good,This job is very demanding and is all about performance. No real reward and No opportunity to move on. The pay is not bad labor work.  Did not see many people stay very long.
good,"I liked the job, it was easy and straightforward but there was too many harassing employees and some managers that worked there. Pay was the best part about working with this company."
good,"challenging , exposed to new technologies , can be frustrating at times, work with smart people, a lot of meetings, customer obsessed, keeps raising the bar"
good,Une entreprise bien organisée mais la demande de productivité et trop par rapport a notre salaire
good,Für ein kurzes Engagement war es in Ordnung. Vergütung war okay.
good,"Come to work, do your job and go home."
good,Although the management at my facility was sub-par it was still a fun and engaging work environment. I enjoy my time working here and I would definitely do it again.
good,It was a great stepping stone to further my experience in the work field. Professional is held respectfully per position that you might have. Amazing service organization.
good,just a job what else? this thing doesn't want to let me continue unless I type a minimum of one hundred and fifty characters. wow still need a whole lot of...done
good,Over all I. Would say amazon is a rest job it’s not the best but it helps you learn what you want Nynorsk in life in you get paid to be in a gym help your stay fit
good,"If you can get on the floor and work then it's good for you, they give you chances to build your career there. But you have to be able to keep up. The pay was very nice."
good,"Amazon is a decent place to work, but you have to be willing to be flexible with your hours to work.  It is not a full- time position it is only seasonal so I would recommend a second job with this job always."
good,"It's a good company to work for if you do not have a family and kids to look after, hours are long but overall its a good job, You must just have enough patience to deal with upset clients all the time"
good,"I like how managers are open with associates. In my building, they care more about safety of employees and number come after. In Amazon, we have different shifts can help if you are parents."
good,Workplace Culture first time experience. Really friendly environment. Team work is strongly advised. Really good in demonstrations. Had a really good experience as a first time job.
good,"It's a good place to get active and motivated, if you've wanted to know what warehouse fulfilment work is like. It gets you to engage with new people and work alongside with them to reach a common goal of fulfilling the customers needs. You earn over the minimum wage which is to be expected considering you are up on your feet for 10 hours every day. Everyone was actually quite friendly and the workforce was very diverse, bringing people of many varieties of cultures into the warehouse-eliminating potential discrimination. You learn straight off the bat about the way the warehouse operates, and once you've been trained, you feel like you're making a big difference to the company."
good,"The workload demand during peak season is not to be taken lightly. For those highly driven people that love a challenge, this environment will welcome them. In exchange, and without adequate to tier management and support, this same person will become disenfranchised."
good,"Obbligatoria la formazione, ambiente molto professionale ma sotto controllo di algoritmi"
good,"it was really a good and challenging experience at Amazon."
good,"warehouse jobs, manual labour, fun place, productive, summer, logistics, supply chain management, assembly, student, An Amazon fulfillment associate performs a huge variety of duties including deciphering work orders, locating merchandize in storage locations, and picking and packing them for shipping to awaiting customers."
good,"Amazon was my first workplace and I can only say it was has led me into being an independent, hard-working individual. I would definitely recommend Amazon to applicants."
good,A good place to work.  The supervisors were very helpful in conducting how Amazon wants the shipping packages placed on the pallets.  If someone gets hurt the management staff is very helpful.
good,"very productive and strict time management. A typical work day was very repetitive, absolutely no cell phones ,security was always very tight , and the management was alert."
good,"Ho lavorato ad Amazon Logistic Verona per tre mesi, all'inizio è difficile e le ore si sentono quando torni a casa. Ho avuto il tempo di imparare a capire il lavoro. Dicembre difficile con tante ore e ritmo pesante e stressante. Penso di essermi comportato bene, rispettoso, volenteroso, disponibile nel fare qualche straordinario in piu' ed ad ulteriori turni non dovuti. Pensavo che il contratto mi fosse rinnovato, non per essere chissà chi, ma perchè mi reputavo degno del primo rinnovo. Nel mese di Gennaio, il giorno della scadenza del contratto mi chiama l'Agenzia dicendomi che non mi rinnovano il contratto per calo di lavoro. Ci sono rimasto male davvero. Mi sono trovato bene devo dirlo e ci andavo volentieri anche con la febbre addosso, ma penso e ne sono convinto che rimangono i piu' lecchini, hanno un gruppo whatsapp e questi sono tranquilli che il contratto gli venga rinnovato. Puoi essere bravo e determinato, cercavo di darmi da fare e cercare di restare fuori da ogni lite che poteva nascere tra persone. Evidentemente NON E' BASTATO. AH dimenticavo, bastava anche cumunicarlo 10 giorni prima e magari dirlo in faccia cosi' sapevo già il mio destino. GRAZIE MANAGER"
good,"good workplace and good jolly environment to learn and grow at . progressive, happening, and focused environment. Stress free and relaxed, no dress code"
good,on casse ton contrat du jour au lendemain juste parce qu'il n'y as plus beaucoup de travail alors que tu fait ta prod et garde ceux qui n'en branle pas une
good,Attending customer concerns about their packages and information on their purchased items. The most enjoyable part of the job is to interact with various of customers and being able to help with any concerns they may have.
good,As a fulfillment associate i feel that this company needs to work on its DAY 1 approach and help its associates during the hiring process and beyond. You are number thats that! If you want a more personal touch find another job elsewhere this aint it!
good,Not a bad place to work if you actually work. Sometimes the rates are hard to keep up with. Since the scanners only work half of the time. During peak season they offer a lot of incentives.
good,bon bah cetait plutot pas mal une bonne ambiance et du travail
good,"This company has a lot going for itself but deep down inside, it's leadership is just like every other company I've worked for. They play favoritism and the work you do isn't as transparent as they try to tell you. If you are one of their best workers they're not going to tell you. Leadership and management are very uninspiring. Leadership and managers are not hands-on at all. Wait till things go bad to step in."
good,"Jednoduchá práce v příjemném kolektivu. Plat by mohl být vyšší, avšak na pokrytí životního minima stačil."
good,"Amazon is great place if you get a job in the office or admin department, to work.fast-paced work environment, excellent company culture, but the department you work in is crucial."
good,"not much to tell, they push us to hard and people are having to use all there personal time to not deal with the stress what more is there to say, I can't deal."
good,"You are your feet all day long.  The workload is heavy & non stop working. You must be able to move fast & able to do what I asked of you quickly. Some many work injuries, with various body parts, back is number. But the benefits are awesome, the pay is ok, but the hours are brutal."
good,"Temporary over Christmas."
good,This is your basic warehouse job where the customer comes before anyone else. They do have an amazing temp agency called Integrity Staffing Solutions that they work with that is awesome tho.
good,"This job was good, easy work as a picker. For me the travel time was too long. Living in Birmingham i had to travel to the city centre and get on the Amazon bus to Rugeley."
good,it was very busy season at amazon as it was a peak season but after peak work load was less and we were relaxed. we had one paid 30 minutes break at amazon also.
good,I worked part time for amazon which is constant moving .They run it like boot camp but its good for structure of the working people. You have to have great work ethics to work here
good,"All are cooperative, good and helping staff there.  U can get help whenever u need. Quick help is there or if u need any kind of medication then its available there."
good,"It's a good company. Employees are fair and friendly. I learned some other department, Salary was good and a fun place to work. They have good benefits."
good,"Amazing job, good pay. Management needed to stop overriding each other. "
good,I enjoyed my time in role. I had the privilege of launching of new facility which was exciting and challenging. The work/life balance could use improvement.
good,Amazon helps you in a lot of ways but you have to work for it. This job is not for everyone but if you can stick it out it can be good for you. Hard work
good,"The job itself is simple enough. Most customers are very friendly, however, you get a few ""keyboard warriors"" who forget they're talking to a human and can be very unkind. The company was great to work for. Working from home was really nice."
good,"Touren überwachen, Fahrer Schulen, Pakete Lieferung"
good,"Ritmi stressanti, tutto molto organizzato e controllato, ma serietà e puntualità nei pagamenti"
good,"was a great job but there was no set schedule you had to get on their website to schedule shifts, everybody trying to get the same shifts, system would crash or lock up by the time you refreshed the page all shifts were gone."
good,"It is very labor and physically intensive.They are very concerned about safety at the workplace,They have employee socials.The workplace culture is to  make sure the customers packages are sorted correctly."
good,"Lavoro e puoi faccio molto attenzione, per non fare errore"
good,"Work ethic,and working with others the people is the best thing about it.No bad about the job one of the best jobs i done had.I would not say nothing bad about"
good,Lots of hours and repetitive work really enjoyed the people I worked with and they where mostly flexible wit the scheduling I enjoyed it for the most part
good,"As a part time employee, Amazon is a great company to work with but the hours is so little that you cant get to pay your bill. Its good as asecond job"
good,"It was fair and had flexible hours and shifts. Overall, a good place to work for college students. I would recommend to anyone who doesn’t mind physical work."
good,"While the benefit of working from home had it's upside, there was a huge downside to talking to customers who know they would never have to look you in the eye: they were extremely rude and entitled. The customers would treat the employees like garbage and we just had to take it. I can usually roll with the punches for the most part, but that job was hurtful. I'll never go back."
good,Amazon is not for everyone. I came in as a L5 Area Manager and worked my way up to an L6 in 3 & half years. The job is very challenging in a good way & the stock options are what keep alot of managers around. It is probably one of the most challenging jobs I have ever had but very rewarding if you can make it. The culture is still a bit of Hunger Games mentality even though they have tried to switch away from that culture it still comes out at times.
good,It's an okay company to work for. The people are decent. I don't have anything else to say about my time there. I worked there for a whole year as a driver and was still labeled seasonal.
good,They will expect you to perform and you should expect to put in a lot of hours. If you are able to manage that then you should do well enough. There is no desk job at Amazon operations.
good,"good pay, hard work, "
good,"Amazon is a great job for the person who likes constant change and a fast paced environment. The culture can be overwhelming at times. Great benefits, but culture tends to breed high turnover and lack of continuity within the organization."
good,Very simple work. No sitting. One can do it for four hours without getting bored. As PT job nice after sitting behind a desk all day. If you develop somehow - it will be purely physical.
good,"A good place to be any difficulty people were more than happy to help out"
good,"You have to be able to move fast on your stops , very little room for error when your delivering the packages. It’s good if your looking for a lot of work , be prepared to be treated as a machine before you take this job."
good,"This job position wasn't that hard at all, but you do stay busy and will always be doing something! The individuals will always be happy to help if you have any questions about anything!"
good,its a lot of standing and hard work. very strict and can be annoying when the managers trap you in certain positions. the job can be a headache but the checks look great.
good,"Travail TRES tranquille, beaucoup trop de surveillance sécurité"
good,Good and fun workplace with good pay. One of their major priority is their employees safety. And their gold is their customer happiness. This is good place to refer friends.
good,Very hard work its a time limit on when things have to be done and if you don't meet the requirements you will be written up. This job is not for everyone you are constantly moving.
good,Belle expérience beaucoup apprécié de travaillé là-bas malgré les boite d’intérim qui ne savent pas géré
good,The work environment is fast. Co-workers are friendly. Learn about up and coming products. Seasonal promotions are exciting and fun. Good cardio workout.
good,But work isn't cut out for a woman my opinion. Hours are excruciating and not enough breaks considering you working a graveyard shift. Felt like a Zombie after my shift was over.
good,Amazon is the place for you if you are able to hit your targets and concentrate on your job. You can easily find lifelong friends if you are a people person.
good,"An okay place to work if you don’t have a life , good pay long hours . Have an opportunity to move up"
good,"Job was okay for extra money . They are very strict on how fast you move & stow packages , you can get write ups . The Breaks are too short . But overall if you need some cash for the time being this is the job for you."
good,"I still work for them...."
good,Managers and supervisors need to be more towards the workers needs. If this is your only job understand then your good but if this is a second job for you then be careful and take care of your self cause they don’t care about your safety
good,Je travaille sans stresse et je gère moi même mes emplois du temps
good,"High demand and expectations, job security isnt really there, pay is awesome but you definitely have to put in the work and hours, the customer service call center is in another country so communication is hard"
good,Amazon challenges you to operate in a very ambiguous space. This is the most rewarding and the most frustrating part of the job. Often management and leadership does not provide a clear picture of how they expect you to operate in this ambiguous space. Best to work here when you are in a role where you work side by side with your direct manager.
good,Amazon is all about the numbers and the almighty dollar Management does not listen to the people that actually do the work to make the job more efficient.
good,Amazon it’s worldwide level good company.they work very fast it’s hard for me .but in future they give too good benefits.overall it’s good place . One thing more it’s really helpful for students.
good,Work hard stay focused . Stay fit and drink a lot of water. Make sure you keep a lot of protein snacks in you for energy. Other than that you should be alright
good,"you pick your shifts. you work when you want. no one on your back about anything. no interview, no resume, mouth swab drug test."
good,"It's a nice and warm place during the winter to work but is very stressful they are never happy with you!!"
good,"I enjoy the physical activity.  They do stay on your back to achieve your quota whether sorting and building pallets... or packing boxes.  It's great if you are a diabetic - as I am.  The physical activity helps you maintain your blood sugar.  It can be described as a ""health club where they pay you""."
good,Would consider another contracted self employed position in future. Liked the flexibility of schedules. Easy to understand instructions. Having customer service experience was an advantage
good,"Můj čas v amazonu jsem si neužil, byl tam velký stres, časový nátlak, nepříjemný spolek v mém čase, nestihl jsem si ani dát oběd a málem jsem omdlel."
good,"Upward promotion is very limited, and it's a lot harder to move around within the company than they lead you to believe."
good,"Bonne entreprise avec un bon relationnel, le personnel est à l'écoute"
good,"Chill and relax. "
good,"As long as I had a fair manager work was good! Otherwise the unfair managers made working unbearable.. Once I had to produce my accommodations letter, they wrote me up unjustly and fired me."
good,Treated like a robot. Barely got any time to eat your lunch. GREAT PAY. Very confusing in figuring out who your actual manager was since they keep moving on the floor all the time.
good,ive learned time management and and the wear house was very cold  hardest part was that you had to move fast at different parts of the wear house. so if you aren't in shape you ave to get in shape
good,"The pay is decent, the benefits are pretty good, but the job itself is very repetitive and boring. It's hard to make it through the days if you're used to a job that's very stimulating, but if you like repetitive motions and walking a lot might be a good fit for you."
good,I don’t think this is fair that indeed is making me write a summary about this job! I don’t want to write a summary for it; and to tip it off they want the summary to be 150 characters.. haha beat you
good,"To advance you must be humble, pay it forward and willing to pursue with a passion any goals you set for yourself. Then you can achieve anything. That's is what I learned and am doing. Join me?"
good,Standed for hours for a low pay and expected to do more than what one could be able to do. Cut breaks so the 4 hour shift turned into 3 hours and we worked straight thru and sometimes no help especially early morning shift unloading trucks all alone and boxes stacked so high and sometimes falling onto you. A lot of managers dictated and didn't help at all and expected more than what could of been done.
good,"i enjoyed my time working at amazon, fun place to work and very productive. They have plenty of parking and a bus route to-from your car. Great place."
good,My review of the company is it has consistent working hours. Especially around the holidays.  The training is very thorough. They make sure you know the job before u have to perform your duties
good,Travail agréable avec de la musique toute la journée et pour tous les style
good,"Long walking hours in a fast manner. if you fail to attend that on the very first day, you will be considered disqualified. otherwise the company is very appealing to many."
good,I really love working at Amazon I learned a whole I was able to do my job very efficiently and a whole lot of other different jobs there you had to keep a percentage I never had a problem doing that my manager always said if he had a hundred of me he will be just fine
good,"it totally depends on the team and your team leader, how you feel at Amazon. Operations is a team you dont want to get into. Stressful life and team full of politics is what you get there. Be careful while you get in a team."
good,Typical work day was about production and safety. Activities for swag dollars were encouraged. Hourly numbers are stressed and must be met. A good experience though.
good,Working for amazon is alright as long as you’re full time. I wouldn’t recommend going the part time route unless you have a secondary job as a backup.
good,Das was generell gut.Viele Erfahrungen über Logistik und Arbeitsumfeld.
good,"Overall it is okay. Choosing a good team and manger is the most important thing. Some teams are extremely good, some are extremely bad. They don't provide too much benefit."
good,"Overall, a good place to work if you need to make money quickly, but I wouldn't consider it a great place to work long term. It can be very hard on your body, and you are pushed to your limit for very long shifts and mandated overtime"
good,"Job was tedious and repetitive. It was a bit boring but time went by fast given that there was always something to do. Job schedule was okay, worked long shifts"
good,"The benefits and pay is well but the culture can easily errode. Not your normal professional setting. (Peculiar)  - Lot's of nepotism and roadblocks if you speak up or out against mistreatment or unethical practices. There is little diversity and inclusion in upper ranks - just sprinkled in middle management ranks where GMs at sites either keep you there or find a way to let you go. Turnover in some building are atrocious. I'm holding on trying to help organization see the way of the future if not it will find itself caught up in litigation after litigation and as a humanitarian to speak up for the associates is my responsibility.  Very long hours with very few (frugality) resources to do your job. HR politely is considered ""rogue"" where most are more unprofessional that the senior leaders. The area managers are the most neglected employees of the group."
good,When I Worked Here I was Fresh out Of High School I Believe I started To Early Working At A place Like That I Wasn’t Ready. but I believe if I went back I would be ready. Not the most terrible to work at just wasn’t for me.
good,This at first was a great job. Until a week  or so into the job I found it very difficult to get in contact with management via phone. The communicate via email only.
good,It was nice working at amazon. 4 days a week 10 hours a day. 7 am to 5pm shift. all day working and busy days. especially christmas time and new year time.
good,travail avec une forte cadence ...si vous faites la production sa ira sinon il vous mettront la pressions .
good,"Heavy workload , alotta of heavy lifting. Equipment Operation. Shipping and Receiving. Stand Up Forklift. Order Picking. Rainbow Stowing. Driving a Clamp Truck"
good,Entreprise qui est active productive  ambiance paisible travail régulier
good,"The work environment is too fast passed, the payment is not enough for the amount of work done, you're expected to process an order every few seconds and orders never stop coming, you're basically getting orders off a shelf that's brought to you by a robot and putting the items in another basket."
good,"Amazon.com is a leading edge company, evolving retail and customer interface every day.  The culture and work life balance is just as fluid. Expectations and goals are clearly communicated, and the customer experience always comes first"
good,I enjoyed working there and plan to go back. The management didn’t seem the best but it’s a great atmosphere and the start out pay is almost breathtaking compared to other jobs
good,Was pretty good. Work flow was fast paced and pretty easy. Management just needed to pay a little bit more attention to detail otherwise the employees and management has the potential to grow and prosper. Overall the jobs I performed were simple and easy to pay attention to and make sure everything I was doing is done at an ordely and professional manner.
good,I don't want to fill this out. This part seems very irrelevant. I just want to set up my account and should not have to spend time writing information.
good,Required 4/10 work week. Often tired at end of each. Involved handling product not family friendly in nature. Led to me leaving the company after one month. Then the job changed from household and entertainment products to amazon fresh. Not enjoyable in the the freezer section.
good,".a typical day at work is as casual as such, nice and pleasant."
good,I enjoyed working at amazon when I first started working there but a few month as the management began to change so did the work experience. the age and promotion of management was to many people that didn't work together when high volume time came around.
good,I was always on time and good work space no ever got hurt the managers were nice but HR is not so good they give u no chance to make up your mistakes.
good,"Its an contract based job,i joined for temporary job,that was an good company for working.ther i have worked as an problem solver and also packing the products. Up"
good,benefits are the only thing keeping me going. If you want a job to just stand in place and lazily look over stuff this is the job for you. making fluff to meet minimum character requirements
good,"Originally I thought I was going to get what I signed up for, a warehouse job, but after the interview process I believed what they were pushing which was growth, opportunity etc... Work culture is all right and recently they have been trying to up there engagements which is great but I wish they would listen to more employees when we ask (for those of us who actually ask) to do more challenging jobs or even just a temp change in job instead of the typical stow and buff position. The fact that I always get put on the same thing makes me consider leaving. (Side note: if your a lady be prepared to get hit on by a bunch of creeps unfortunatly harassment is something companies have no control over before hand so in no way fault the company but with as many people that work there I guess this is bound to happen)"
good,I absolutely love working in ICQA and VRets departments. I enjoy learning about Inventory Control and Quality Assurance. As well as Vendor Returns. Every day is different and every day presents new challenges both physically and mentally.
good,"My job description, I greet all my customers with a smile also I make sure all their packages get to the locations without it being broken or damaged."
good,Andauernt höhe und höhe stuckzahl. Gute vorgesetzte!!!
good,A typical day at work can be very monotone. There is much that change in the work environment as to be expected from a distribution center. The work culture is not so bad since you have alot of time to socialize as you work with others. There is room to relax and work at your own pace.
good,"The thing that stands out about working at this company is the pay and the benefits they offer to employees. Otherwise, the time and how much you work depending on if they need you or not is not fair."
good,The job was well organized.  I liked that the trainers never left tou until your were comfortable about the job. The company rewards there employees well.
good,The whole facility is a large family environment. The people you work with are diverse and very interesting. My manager was one of the nicest people I know
good,It’s a great company to work for every one is out going. I learn many things like how to work on a fast paced and work smarter to get through the day.
good,"Ve skladu amazona existuje hodne oddeleni, zamestnancy kterych maji velke rozdily ve prace, Nektere muzou v prubehu prace hrat ve nastolni futbolek, a nekdo nema cas na zachod nebo odpocinek. Vzdelavacni program je hezky, ale jestli mas problem s QPI nebo vztahem s vedeni nikdy tam nedostanes."
good,I really enjoy the job however it seems a little disorganized which has caused somethings to be forgotten. The management is so busy they have little time to respond to issues.
good,"It was a pleasant experience working for Amazon because there were great co workers who worked hard like I did. I always believe in making the most of my time while on duty, not only for the customer, but for my employer, and for myself. I made several wonderful friends while working for Amazon who had great work ethics just as myself."
good,I dont have much to say but if u lazy this not a job for you. Amazon does make u earn your pay i just think they should pay more being its alot of ware and tare on our bodies. It was lots of gossip being its to many kids there. But beyond that i made my money and did my job...
good,Working at amazon was a little overwhelming but I liked it. They were very strict about every single thing and there was a couple of rude people that were rude just because they were stressed out.
good,If you can handle hard physical work and graveyards then this is a great job. Don't expect for promotion just find what you're  good at and have fun doing it.
good,"The training and my managers were great. The work was customer service, so not the best, but there was usually support. The pay and ability to work from home was the only reason I remained there."
good,At amazon the job was fast paced and laid back. Our goals were always met at the end of each day. The distance was just to far from home which caused problems sometimes.
good,"In flex customer service, you will move at a fast past and no two days are the same.  It was a great Flex position to make some great money during the holidays, and working from home is a great bonus."
good,"As a warehouse associate at Amazon I learned to work many different job roles such as picker/packer, scanner, unloader, lane captain, etc. The work environment was very fast paced."
good,"Picking up and loading up the customer  orders  were a pain cause of the small warehouse  and  it being full of people. Having to find the orders and load them up into your vehicle  was a little bit of a pain since warehouse qasnt organized all that well so that cuts into delivery time and if your shift is up, the app closes out try tobefast cause I almost got cut out on my last delivery so I'm glad I still was at the"
good,I learned mostly about diversity and building leadership. I was able to have a comfortable work schedule.i think the hardest thing there was loading up vans individually.
good,"they were not supportive or caring"
good,A normal work day was from 7-AM to 7-PM with three breaks throughout the day. The work i was designed to do was overall organized and easy to handle. My favorite part had to be all the food trucks that come around lunch.
good,"I worked in inbound (receive/stow) and was very lucky with my supervisor and manager when I started - they listened to what I wanted to do and supported me in getting the relevant training.  This said, my lead(s) were getting busier all the time, and seemed to be unavailable towards the end of my time with the company due to increased responsibilities and expectations with minimal support from the ever more absent managers."
good,J'aime le contact humain. Etre la pour le client et faire se qui faut pour subvenir a besoins des autres.
good,Wouldn’t  work with my school schedule and caused a lot of absences which caused me to fail my semester. This company can be very stressful because of timing and different locations.
good,"nothing else follows i will not say anything more about this company there is nothing more to say, i cant help you with completing this thing just saying stuff to fill up this 150 character minimum."
good,"Hard workplace,managmet colapse somtimes,uneaven attitude to employees.Brake times couculations in seconds. Good sallary,at peaktime ,but not more ,take your money and leave this place."
good,"A typical night was long and hard on my feet, management wasn't good at the time of opening. Culture was varies but the hardest was picking items and floor was long and hard."
good,Hard but good workLemon Greek Salad 490 Lemon Greek Salad 490 Lemon Greek Salad 490 cal you know it was great and relaxing an di was able to do lots of stuff easily due to my abilities
good,they dont do part time which is a shame which is why i had to leave. It wasnt too bad at first but it was difficult to work so fast and you dont get much break
good,Over working the workers good job but can get very stressful pick rates barely reachable .....almost  fainted one time because I was working too hard  ...but still a good job
good,Credo che nel giudizio sia di gran rilevanza il periodo dell' anno in cui si comincia l' esperienza lavorativa e per quanto si prolunghi poi il rapporto.
good,We would warm up before getting started.  Talk as a group about the day ahead. Then go off into our separate groups. 10 hrs. 2 15 mins breaks 1 30 min lunch
good,"È solo un lavoro come un altro, bisogna capire che tipo di situazione lavorativa si desidera visto,i ritmi stressanti che comporta... Amazon ti chiede una velocità di picking,che non è per tutti ,visto il gran numero di persone che lavorano con te.... Per gli orari,beh stendiamo un velo pietoso,chi ha famiglia........"
good,"This place was my first introduction to a job and i did not mind working there but i would not do it gain because through SMX, the company that did the hiring for Amazon at the time was not that good at providing valid information"
good,Focus on the company and your individual experience while employe there provide reasion for why you like this like working at the company all submited .
good,"Too much emphasis on making rates.  Why can't a company be glad they have employees that want to work instead of bothering them that they can't pack, pick, count, etc. like Superman (who is not real anyway)"
good,"great company, will assist in what you need to be successful in your job daily, car about you as a employee and person, management needs to learn how to respect others when communicating"
good,"Muy estresante, compañeros muy bien pero los Leads nada comprensivos. Exigen demasiado. Si un día haces 1000 paquetes, el siguiente te exigen 2000."
good,it was alright working there... if your good at something there they will always put you there no matter how much it wears you down or diffcult to keep up with.
good,"Warehouse job within a fast paced environment. "
good,"A fast paced environment with hard work."
good,"Really relaxed work environment. Good pay and benefits. Fun activities and parties at work. Free snacks and a full cafe inside. Pool table and other things to relax after stressful calls"
good,"I enjoyed working there for the first few months including the Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year holidays. Getting the items was a bit of a breeze and easy to do in the time you had for them. However, due to careless shoppers, they had to implement more tedious and painful roadblocks to prevent lazily finishing orders."
good,They didnt give u enough time to learn the position very fast pace. If you couldn't keep up then you get fired. I didnt really like the job. They way that fire u is embarrassing.
good,"Everyday is different due to route assignment, weather, traffic, environment, locations and fun, too. The challenging part is able to deliver and complete on time."
good,"Good company, but could pay LA associates better. A lot of work for less pay in regards to management. However, there is a lot opportunities to internal transfers."
good,"Safety is top priority in this fast paced work environment. "
good,Depending on your location you will either always be running around like a chicken with your head cut off or you'll all do it collectively twice a year and give yourselves stress related injuries. I don't regret working there but i do regret the people i worked under.
good,Environment was great make new friends build relationships but management was a pain. No job security even when your a blue badge. They expect to much and give so little
good,"Decent pay with people with little or no experience, Hard work face pace environment. "
good,"A good place to work if you are on time, work hard and can keep up with the pace. Good medical benefits and paid time off.  Amazon has strict productivity requirements and can exhausting, depending what your work position is."
good,It was fine and a great place to grow. They gave you overtime sometimes it was manditory overtime. they did random drug test and were very flexible with the work hours.
good,"- Morgen Meeting "
good,Amazon is a good company to work. The work culture is good. The colleagues are friendly. I enjoyed working with the company. The organization is good with good working standards.
good,J’ai bien aimais cette expérience dommage d’être trop surveiller
good,"Amazon is a great company with great opportunities. The greatest problem are Leader and Managers, really unprepared and unfair, they don't really know what they are doing."
good,"There's a physical requirement to work here, requiring that you have some sort of physical endurance. The work is easy in theory but strenuous in practice."
good,"Job can be mind numbing and repetitive."
good,"Unloaded shipping containers and deliveries and"
good,I loved working there. The managers were very nice but I didn't particularly like working 3rd shift. I was sleepy and extremely tired. That's about it.
good,the work was hard and i just did not feel like its the right job for me.There was heavy lifting and my back would hurt because of the lifting. My sleeping pattern was disturbed
good,"Very energetic and fast paced work place . Cautious about safety and well-being of the employees. Lots of insentives for attendance , safety and work accomplishments."
good,"While I would say that it isn't really for people that don't find warehouse work or menial labor, I must also add in that it pays well, and with such a wide amount of people, you're bound to get introduced to people that make it more bearable."
good,They treat you like soldiers or it’s like being back at school. Really strict. I’m not against rules at work but they take it to far. Woudnt recommend working there
good,"Ok place to work. Long hours. Alot of young people work there. You have alot of people walking around most times not doing anything. See some people not following dress code but no one says anything. Pay just isnt enough. This is a good place for teenagers fresh out of highschool, young adults or retirees. Pay isnt that good. In order to get a nice check. You have to work overtime hours."
good,Only work there if you have someone working there that can get you into management so you  won't have to actually work...The only upside to working there is the benefits and option to go to school that is paid for....
good,"Demanding. High pace. Regardless of position, greater physical exertion is possible. Fatigue can easily set in.  Must have a strong mental fighting spirit otherwise a weak willed person will crumble under the pressure and stress of performance."
good,I just feel like they shouldn’t allowed 2 chances with upt because people be having car accidents and they still get terminated just for going into the negative with upt
good,"A typical day at Amazon is being able to perform under and adapt to constant pressure and changes while meeting daily CPTs."
good,"Nel complesso un ambiente discreto, alcuni processi lavorativi "
good,"It was a nice place to work very very nice yes very nice I would do it again very cool, loved it high in the mountains, super early drive, disgustingly late finishes ouch"
good,"Was ok for the time being, but work you more than what they pay you. They tell you one schedule, than eventually changes up the schedule. Management seems lost half the time"
good,"Amazon is a fast paced environment and there's no time to mess up or stall. You get there, clock in, constantly moving and the typical day Is always a ten hour shift. Everyone is easy to get along with but it did not have the best management team."
good,A typical day at work was to answer customers related to queries on products sold on the website. The workplace culture was relaxed you can go down to the pool table during your breaks.
good,"Great place to learn, but painful to progress. Opportunities to learn new skills and get exposure to different lines of the business are everywhere. Mission is often lost for self promoting."
good,Amazon is a great place to work. I am just looking to get into the field that I am studying in. Great benefits pay is a little lacking. There is a very huge gap in communication with management here though.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Amazon but years but I was hired in as part-time flexible hours, what they don't tell you is that in the Christmas season, there is no part-time and the hours are just not flexible enough. I also applied for phone and chat and after I was hired in, it was phone only, I really wanted mainly chat because I am a Mom and wanted to help with the income but I can't have a completely quiet house all the time, even when my husband is home, the kids come to me for everything. I had some great managers and I have had some awful managers. The pay is good and they give free Vision and Dental which is very nice but if you need something flexible and part time, good luck, it is only a little flexible and they will give you full time hours without the benefits during peak seasons and times."
good,"I was a vendor working at Amazon via contract, so I can't really say what it's like to be an actual Amazon employee. The group I worked for was good and my experience there was pretty average."
good,Le problema es que pagan poco. Fuera de eso no hay cosas negativas de la empresa.
good,"The work is repetitive, and physically demanding. The pay is decent, you get a good amount of time off, and benefits. Very easy to get hired. It's a good job to have temporarily. Some choose to make a career out of it."
good,Amazon allowed me to spend more time with my family aswell as trying something different than im used to. The work life balance is definitely the  selling point.
good,"Job it’s good ."
good,Je pense que la relation avec c'est collègue et importante pour un bon fonctionnement t
good,I did not like working for this company. It was not a vert good environment  to work in and it was stressful because the companies expectations were way too high.
good,"I love to work in amazon because there are very good salary , multi national and also I have a lot friends , l have great experience and I can work in any department and any days"
good,Very stressful but rewarding. The change over the 9 years that I have worked here are tremendous. I enjoyed the freedom and ability to make decisions at the plant level but that has all changed.
good,"fast pace, competitive place to work, management always ready to help and support. work place very safe, all safety equipment provided if needed. overal good place to work."
good,When I worked for amazon I walked 22 miles a night and stayed extra 2 hours every night cleaning up. Management was nice sometimes but the outbound dock was very busy.
good,Quite a demanding job physically and in terms of work pace but well remunerated. Employees seem to get on well with each other. Almost everyone in the same boat.
good,Became difficult to pick up shifts because they were hiring so many people .So i eventually became uninterested in working there because a lack of jobs.
good,I learned how to scan merchandise and place the correct items in the  bins for outgoing deliveries for customers. The company is a high demand environment.The hardest part of the job was climbing up and down a ladder to place the merchandise in the correct bin as a picker.
good,They have good canteen clean Often cleaning i dont feel good They have their amazon Policy and They Foster you spy people and harasment people With rate or target
good,"A typical work day at Amazon is relatively quick if you work a normal amount of time. Once you do over-time, it feels eternal. Just go in, do your job, do not squander your time, and you should be fine."
good,"Ritmi troppo sostenuti per un lavoro notturno, responsabili troppo ostili nei confronti degli operai."
good,"I have nothing to add at this time, I am a newer employee. I have only been there a shore time and I don't really know much about the company yet other than 3rd shift is hard."
good,"polite and working on time every working 6 am no time for clock out"
good,Ich bin zufrieden aber kann leider Gesundheitlich nicht als Versandmitarbeiterin arbeiten deshalb brauche ich eine neue herrausforderung in meist sitzender Tätigkeit
good,"great place to work at, excellent diverse staff. All staff enjoy working at the work place, and have many trainings doing their job.Pay is awesome, benefits are amazing. Relaxed dress code. You can use PTO when ever. Most associates are super friendly."
good,Fast paced lots bending walking have to keep up so many products min so u always on go no smoke breaks really building so big by time u do get to front u have turn right back around or u will b late and lose some points toward the items u HV picked
good,"Pros: Pay is awesome, benefits are amazing. Relaxed dress code. You can use PTO when ever. Most associates are super friendly. "
good,"The training process was okay, because the position was virtual, there is no one to turn to for help. This left me feeling lost a lot of the time when i first started. They do have a help chat but this was not ideal for me."
good,"•	Instructor /Trainer for all systems in the Facility"
good,"I would say Amazon is a place that welcomes diversity. They're very good at considering people's religious beliefs. Most coworkers are laid back and help each other out. However, depending on who your supervisor is you can get blackballed into doing the same thing over and over again. Also written up if you fall just below 100%. Barriers they don't care if it interferes with your productive."
good,"If you enjoy staying on your feet and constantly working in a fast paste environment, then this is for you.  I had an overnight shift and it can get tiring but after your shift it feels like you had a full workout."
good,"I worked for contract delivery company. It was long hours, based on how fast you were down with your deliveries, you may have had to go help another driver. Which seemed unfair to me."
good,Amazon is a good company and nothing more to say. They are good people. They give their workers a chance to work all night if possible. HR answers you.
good,Did dock work more other duties as well be prepared to stand on yo feet for at least 10 hours overall the work was easy just fast pace long as you catch on
good,"Long hours , standing for ages, free tea & coffee , lots of overtime, nice people and place to work or second job weekly pay large building but kind of far"
good,"great work place to work, nice and hard working co worker who are willing to help out during fast tracking shift. would recommend anyone to work there over and over again"
good,"The place is eeh. Great benefits, Great people, Amazing environment. Poor management."
good,"Je n'ai personnellement pas vécu une bonne expérience à AMAZON, le rythme de travail ou encore la pression de certains managers ne mettaient pas forcement à l'aise. Sans compter la fatigue et le rythme de travail qui n'était pas toujours simple"
good,It was an average factory job that makes you work for every bit of your pay check. Nothing that stands out good or bad but overall not my favorite job
good,"Amazon is a dynamic environment and a high percentage of competent people. It may bot be for everyone since you have to be strong, assertive and willing to accommodate ambiguity if you want to survive. That being said you will definitely learn much about yourself and business at an accelerated pace for sure. I was a contractor so I managed my work life balance I can see where FTEs would make many compromises but that is  dependent on what group you work in"
good,You're on your feet all day. Little to no breaks. Management is horrible. Heavy lifting all day with no help. But if you work enough hours you will see a decent paycheck. Overnight hours really suck.
good,Il faut être dynamique et avoir une bonne cohésion
good,I am a seasonal sort associate and I find my job at Amazon rewarding. It is not a hard job but it is physical you are working at a semi fast paced but it is not hard you just have to not be lazy.
good,I had worked in amazon at MXP 5 located in Castel San Giovanni in the province of Piacenza in the Inbound sector to do Pick working hours were in turn from 6 a.m. at 14 p.m. Or from 14 p.m. at 20 p.m. And they changed from week to week ... During the Christmas season I decided to do night shifts that started at 18 p.m. At 2 a.m. and sometimes for longer hours for overtime due to the high peak of work
good,"I would reccommend for the wages and overtime opportunities, not a good shift selection, poor management, schedule always changing, on a busline but you have to walk about a half mile"
good,"Its okay job not for everyone assuming that you really don't have a life. The job is very fast, annoying at times. The hours you are going to hate or like depends if you are a morning person who a night person"
good,"Stress for all levels of employment"
good,"Training just a few days, the production is expected right away. There should be more lea way for new employees. i didnt experience a good work environment."
good,fast pace environment steady work flow that keep me challenge and responsible to my duties and perform on a high level and be reliable for caring out my job duties and be professional in my department
good,"une trés bonne entreprise ou on apprend beaucoup de chose, en travaillant dans de différents postes"
good,"Hi, "
good,non male se non male un esperienza da fare tutto un altra metodo di lavoro che differisce da quello italiano
good,"Good place to work, some managers were very nice but the company focus too much in the numbers, you are more than a number. People gets hurt and they see you as a bother."
good,Not what I wanted to do but I needed a job at the time due to relocating. It was a lot of standing in one spot for 8-12 hrs. The had great benefits and a nice facility
good,"very fast paced environment but the employees are great. Paternity leave requires that employees work at least a year before being eligible, however, medical insurance is day 1."
good,Not much to say. Those youtubers are telling the truth. It's an unhealthy lifestyle and I wouldn't recommend anybody to apply and work there. Unless they are okay with excessive labor.
good,"My particular manager was good, but upper level management was non communicative, slow to act, and at times did not seem to know what they were doing. My district manager had little to no oversight, and was the laziest manager I've ever had, getting away with 'work from home' days he was not supposed to take because of such a lack of oversight. When myself and my manager contacted upper level management about this and other behavior from our District manager, it took almost a year before he was finally let go for incompetence. They also promise new development, pay raises, vertical and lateral job opportunities; however when applying to these positions our applications would be denied without any explanation. They will dangle the promise of promotions infront of you, right up until the day they officially announce you're all being laid off due to store closing."
good,"It’s a job for a few that can work long hours lifting heavy loads continuously.                 "
good,It was good working with Amazon.Work environment was excellent. Mangerial work was also good.Being a MNC work culture was great.I would love to work over again if I get chance.
good,The harder you worker the harder they want you to work. Appreciation is not equal to amount of work they want. It’s almost like being in high school again.
good,Amazon is a good place to make money but a bad place for advancement but you will learn how to drive a fork truck how to stay busy if that wasn't your work ethic but after that you will have that after working there
good,"Lots of driving in all kinds of areas with standard lunch break and two 15 min. breaks.  Route would very with each day, so no time to get familiar with any one route's unique delivery environment. I enjoyed the challenge, but because you don't really get to know the routes you are always racing to complete your deliveries on-time."
good,"Tratan los empleados como maquinas y no como seres humanos, los managers se ponen de acuerdo para hacer que despidan empleados un turno de 12 hr solo tiene 2 30 min de break    10 son caminando pal break room."
good,Lo que mas me gusta de mi trabajo es que todos nos ayudamos para cumplir con todas las metas del trabajo
good,"It was an overall easy job on paper, but in practice, it was very demanding on its workers. My biggest problem was the lack of adequate pay for work accomplished. This has changed since leaving and having been there, I have reconsidered re-applying for part time with the increased pay rate. The only other gripe I have would be the lack of human interaction for my shift that I was on, 12 am to 6 am. I didn't mind the hours themselves, but we didn't have a Human Resources department for those times, and due to the automated systems Amazon uses, there were many complaints from my coworkers regarding these systems, I knew quite a few people who were terminated in the system, but only found out because they couldn't open our ID locked door."
good,"""Customer Obsessed"" is there motto, which makes sense because the packages come first, not the worker. They just need bodies anyone can work there. Pretend to care about employees but do not."
good,Amazon is very stressful place to work very fast paced environment. the culture is either do it or this place is not for you. Dangerous place its a lot of machines that can be dangerous. Amazon pays well but they demand 12 hour shifts during the holidays 6 days a week. Only 30 minute lunch two 15 minute breaks not enough when you work 12 hour shifts 6 days a week.
good,Fajna praca lecz za dużo pracy i godzin. Niestety jest ciężko
good,"Working at Amazon is not for everyone. Yes the pay is competitive, but they have a quota. I worked the the receiving department, we would take product and fill the pods. The work was monotonous and their wasn't much opportunity to interact with your coworkers. The management came around to comment on your job performance, but that was about it. I personally did not enjoy my time their, but many people did."
good,Amazon delivery is a very fast-paced easy job  . It could get a little hectic with always trying to look for your packages  when loading at the station.
good,"Nel Centro Logistico MXP5 di Castel san Giovanni (PC) ho trovato manager sono molto meritocratici: riconoscono miglioramenti di rendimento dei lavoratori. La sicurezza dei lavoratori viene sempre prima. Convenzioni con palestra e natatorio. Peccato per la pausa risicata (appena mezz'ora) di cui un quarto d'ora abbondante è sacrificato per raggiungere gli spogliatoi e fare lo stesso lungo tragitto al ritorno, cosa inevitabile, ma anche dalla fila alla mensa che sarebbe stata più velocemente fruibile se ci fosse stato un inserviente in più (ce n'è solo uno, ma credo che la responsabilità sia dell'azienda che si occupa della ristorazione nel suddetto centro logistico)."
good,"Typical day, involves deliveries with clear destinations and generally get paid 3 days after.  Very direct.  I enjoy the experience.  Amazon allows you to learn and teach yourself at the same time."
good,"Good pay for work but hours are long with no music & barely any interaction, managers want you to keep up same speed for a full 12 hour shift and if you use all of your time your automatically fired."
good,"musica che concilia il lavoro e molta attenzione per la sicurezza del dipendente."
good,Its ok but be ready for heavy stuff and work a lot of overtime in prime week and peak season. The pay is $15. But you start like a seasonal And then you ver Hire by the company.
good,"très bonne entreprise, ils sont très cool et tolérants, par contre le salaire ne convient pas au niveau de travail."
good,I had bad experience working there it was always a problem with something when I started working there and the supervisor wasn't doing they job not organized
good,Hated that the area assistants checked your whereabouts to the very second and seriously questioned you about where you were. They also need to install more bathrooms on each floor.
good,Part time in certain locations have inconsistent hours if working the overnight shift yes the pay is decent but you'll never really get to see real money unless its peak season
good,"Ambiente amigable, areas de descanso y muchos beneficios como acceso a servicios médicos y servicio de transporte para las personas que entraban muy temprano o salían muy tarde."
good,"trabajo duro, poco compañerismo, i no valoran tu trabajo, ja que yo trabajé duro durante 4 meses I no me han vuelto a llamar, lo uníco bueno es que pagan bien los fines de semana."
good,"I am an independent contractor."
good,Typical warehouse work. I wouldn't recommend it as a career to anyone. There is a high turnover rate for a reason. The work can be stressful but it's a fine stop-gap.
good,"I did this for the exercise and experience , but overall too much km walking especially with PPE.. Need some machines to help with the order picking and travel within the site.. .."
good,Nothing to say about the company....of you enjoy standing in a box for 11 hours a day. Than the ts the job for you. Most people hate it but a few enjoy it
good,"competitive"
good,"The position worked well for me as supplemental income while a student, but I cannot stress enough that the physical needs of the job and the long hours of constant movement really takes its toll on some."
good,Is a great place for young people to work if just looking for a paycheck.  HR picks and chooses the rules on a daily basis. Managers should be given more training.
good,"Operator camp forklift"
good,"A lot of young and inexperienced young people in upper level and entry level positions. Everyone is on the same pay level no matter your role,unless your an operations manager."
good,You need to work with Amazon to know their work style.As a member of AWS team i serve as the sourcing expert for a group of job families we are actively recruiting for Premium Support. The teams consist of Cloud Support Associates and Enginners along with TAM's. I have significant influence and impact over the delivery of sourcing and pipelining while fostering a collaborative environment to ensure a great candidate experience and raising the bar with each candidate hired.
good,I worked for Amazon for 3 years. Some parts of them were better than others but that's the job. It had job security for the most part but alot of things could change
good,Trabajo dinámico y con buen ambiente.Alta exigencia
good,I think working at amazon can learn a lot of new things and you can make friends with an excellent background. But the salary is quite low and you have to work very hard.
good,"It was a labor intensive job (especially on Sundays) and it was hard organizing ourselves without the manager. Some employees who had been working for Amazon Prime for a while took it upon themselves to handle situations. Some of those times resulted in more conflict and made me wish there was someone else who specifically dealt with the problems we encountered. Another thing that bothered me was how we had to stay ""on the ball"" all the time. Days where it was especially crazy (had consistently 20 orders or more to complete) we couldn't feel free to take our breaks because others would get overwhelmed and more orders wouldn't get completed in time. The regional manager would simply send out a message telling us to move faster and more efficiently. Picking up shifts was also intense and took less than a second for all the newly dropped shifts to disappear. Luckily most of my co-workers were kind and considerate, allowing for cooperation and assistance when needed. Also I barely had time to find lunch and eat it with our 15 minute breaks; I barely would eat some days."
good,"No te contrata directo la empresa y no te hablan con la verdad, un día sin mas ni mas te dicen que ya no sigues laborando ahí, considero que si solo contratan por campañas que lo hagan saber a las personas y ellas determinaran si toman el trabajo o no. como tan valioso es su tiempo, como el de las personas que buscan trabajo."
good,Amazon is a good place to have an awesome pay and benefits but the managment there is really bad they are bunch of fresh out of collage individuals who don't know how to run a shift
good,"Most managers are really nice, easy going to a point. But they wont let you talk at all to your fellow coworkers even if youre still being productive."
good,Worked remotely.  Very demanding job schedule and the bidding process was confusing at first.  Managers change a lot and required many group meetings (via skype) to discuss production and scheduling.
good,Overall. It's a job where you can get a full time or part time position. A lot of different shifts which is good. I do the 12 hour 3 overnights and a 6 - hour volunteer day if it's available or someone is always looking to give or switch but make sure you so all this in AMAZON A-Z that's the app where they keep all your hours and days and money. etc
good,"Each day is exciting.  You never know what your day will entail, depending on the different types of skills you acquire and tasks you are trained for.  What you do and make of it is all up to you."
good,"Could not stay busy, kids working there operating machines not fully trained to do so using them for reckless behavior while on drugs.  When brought to management took 3 discussions before removal of person. Process assistants believe they can treat employees like they are important and get away with it."
good,"I was an Amazon ambassador I train the new hires during peak season lots of fun my biggest class I teach was around 36 people by myself, lots of the people that I train got hired on into blue badges"
good,Was ok till a certain manager was totally rude. They said it's a fun work environment but not totally. You always have a downgraded manager some where and that sucks.
good,multi task job you do from stamping labels to stocking to dock work picking items for customers daily helping other co workers  very busy day all day.for 10 hour shift
good,"Turni di almeno  ore al giorno, non come da contratto. Le ore straordinarie tutte retribuite. Contratto rinnovato ogni 30 giorni. Non molta meritocrazia, ma molta raccomandazione."
good,The main problem i had was having to work at a feverish pace all shift. I was in the prep department and you need to perform at 100% production every day. It is possible but you have to maintain the fast pace for 10 hours. Alot of the times people were cherry picking so all the good boxes were gone by the time you scanned your material. So those times you received terrible boxed material.
good,it was one experince that was different but good.If we didnt understand something they have teachers the teach you whatever is needed to know.you get three breaks in a day
good,"Amazon has a bad habit of screwing over it's hardest workers. Come in, do your job, have fun, and leave. Don't devote yourself to the company too much or you will regret it. Management is almost always terrible so don't be surprised when you do it the ""Amazon"" way, which makes no sense. Amazon is great, the warehouses aren't."
good,"Amazon is a pretty cool job, I learned that if you put your mind to it you can do it no matter how hard it gets don't give up, keep pushing and stand strong on your growth at Amazon ."
good,colleghi rapporti meno stimolanti e meno tenaci tutto il resto pulito e gradevole
good,The job is a decent warehouse job management is really the only problem in my opinion but it is very fast paced job environment and it you dont keep you you will be left behind
good,Amazon is a good place to work overall. I really enjoy my coworkers but it's becoming extremely micromanaged and the workers are simply a number. Great health benefits is a plus.
good,Good place to work. very fast paced work place. very fair and equal opportunities. Management us very nice and very helpful when starting out. job advancements all the time
good,I have been there 2 years when you first get to work you clock in and walk to your stand up area where you stand in front of your manger while he talks about what the goals are for that day then we stretch and after we go to our stations
good,I enjoyed working at Amazon but I got a new job closer to home.  The atmosphere is fast paced but there are alot of opportunities to advance within the company
good,"Very demanding, very busy, not alot of time on breaks. Didn't really see operation managers until end of shifts some days. Alot of different personalities."
good,Overall I rate them at a 3. Benefits are great. Work environment is decent. Management is ok. It’s a good place to work but my personal experience was not that great.
good,Amazon was a great place to work! The pay was pretty low; however the benefits were great and I enjoyed my coworkers.I was exposed more to the shipping and receiving position of the job which kept me working hard and paying attention to learn more. The hours were very flexible so I didn't feel as if my time was consumed so much since I chose my work hours and days. The culture was great. I formed great friendships with the employees as well as the managers.
good,It was okay as long as you adhere to any changes that may come about last minute. The project I was assigned to seemed to be unorganized at times because we were in the beta stages.
good,"Empresa boa, nao sendo a melhor e nem a pior. Desenvolvi e aprendi bastante na area de segurança, iniciando sites do zero e atendendo as politicas da empresa quanto ao nivel de segurança exigido nos Data Centers da Amazon. Meu gerente compartilhou muito do seu conhecimento onde ajudou no meu crescimento professional."
good,"If you got this job you won't need a gym anymore.Fast pace job, work overnight. If you ok with that this is the perfect job for you. they pay weekly no matter what."
good,"While Amazon has a good structure for temporary employees, for employees seeking long term employment this can prove to very challenging. Payment structures could also improve based on individual employee statistics. Shift scheduling is another area that could use major improvements."
good,"Sicherheitskleidung wird gestellt."
good,"very fast paced,compensated fairly,work in all weather...day startsearly and may not end until route is complete...some days more than 10hours but if you hustle itis rewarding"
good,"The job itself is not difficult at all. Learn you're area and you will become very proficient."
good,"I have interviewed to move up 8 times and have been told ""great interview, but we are going a different direction"" every time.  I am older than all of my managers and possibly more experienced?  I think they may feel threatened I can take their position and so I am always beaten out by someone in the same 20 something group.  They are not looking for great employees, they are only looking for great story tellers......take an interview and you will understand exactly what I mean.  Decent place to work, GREAT benefits, but the glass ceiling for a 40 year old with lots of experience is super low....but hey, at least I have a job."
good,"It was stressful and tiring as a full time employee there. No appreciation from"
good,I enjoyed and loved working at amazon. I loved my job. I was there for 7 years or close to it. I liked helped the employees when they encountered problems with the products. I was always busy I knew my job and I was very good at what I did everything I did was very detailed orientated after a few year I was asked to train employees you applied for the position. I also traveled to California when they opened a new site to train employees there.
good,There's good things and things that need improvement but it's a pretty ok place to work. It's a pretty fast paced environment. You have to be ready for whatever changes that may happen.
good,"easy place to get the hang of. learned about how warehouses work. your doing something the whole time. was a set schedule"
good,Really appreciated the accomdation to transfer home when my family needed me to come home.Would like to move closer to home in Silver Spring..Thanks for helping me..
good,"Better easy going if you do the overnight shift.plus it's a $1 more pay and Not as stressful and you dont pick just scan packages or diverting packages on the conveyor belt. Also, there is some favoritism so be useful to be noticed. You can also become blue bag part time permanent after like 6 week conversion but you have to make sure you are on time and doing tour best. If not, someone else will.take your place. Amazon is a revolving door so as easy as you get tour job the quicker they will.let you go!"
good,A typical day consisted of me pulling inventory from the shelves in a timely fashion. I learned how to multi-task in a short amount of time. The culture there was very friendly and motivational. The hardest part was pulling inventory and you only had a certain time frame to do it in. It was very friendly to work there.
good,Busy work lots of standing. Very hard on a person body. Good benefits. Can be a good company to grow with as long as you enjoy that form of work. Give it a try.
good,Management of time and job training is supported but is ultimately the employees responsibility.  Human resources is very accessible to the employee. Respect for the employee from management is very accessible  and consistent to the employee. I would recommend the company to job seekers.
good,il faut avoir du mental et être prêt a mettre sa vie de coter pour se travail
good,good company to start working with and they are very flexible with your schedules if you have a legit proof that you will have to attend to certain important matters.
good,Amazon has great Benefits and fosters creativity.  The work load is very heavy.  There is a saying at Amazon that the work load is trying to drink out of a fire hose.
good,"Help desk technicians are vital to the IT workforce, as they keep the technologies that organizations rely on to do business up-to-date and running smoothly."
good,Job interview was easy  it was a mass interview so you don’t feel alone in the process. Majority of interviewee’s got the job. Amazon is a good place to work.
good,"Overall working at amazon has provided me with a'lot of knowledge to take with me through life, they have a big diversity of people working there and i have met some amazing people along my journey through Amazon that have also taught me great values. The work is tough as a regular associate but if you work hard you'll have plenty of chances for advancement."
good,"Not a alot of hours, but work was easy to do, unless you were on the production line, nice co-workers. Supervisors didn't help a lot, just stand around and you do all the work when we were busy."
good,Stable job with great managers.  Get used to changes every 5 mins.  Limited growth potential.  Limited employee perks (more would have been nice).  Over all recommend.
good,Its like being in high school  all over again. If you liked high school you will like it here.  I don't have much else to say Indeed is just making me write this review.
good,could be a great place to work if you like this type of work. can be stressful  . it was not the job for me but it was great help in a time of need...
good,"Its ok , as with every job there are ups and downs , amazons downs are that you have to be able ans know how to work that gps when you are in the middle of nowhere"
good,It can be quite stressful but mostly you just feel the long hours. Very physical and tiring at time but it does offer solid pay with opportunities to move up and move around.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Amazon due to the physicality of the work. However, the demand to make your scanning quota becomes a bit of an issue due to the amount of problem boxes, and labor sharing (switching jobs for the day). Also, HR does not handle employee requests and issues like they claim to do upon hiring."
good,bonne entreprise avec un fort rythme mais travail sous de bonnes conditions.
good,"Leider sehr unpersönliche Atmosphäre, trotz übertrieben hohe Erwartungen, und überhaupt nicht Kritikfähig, selbst wenn es offensichtlich ist, das sich die Arbeit dadurch enorm verbessert und erleichtert wird."
good,Best part time job to earn fast money especially during the holidays with few benefits on top of that once you are blue badge. I also love the flexible scheduling options. Too bad employees are not valued.
good,Solo per conoscenza e simpatia rinnovano i contratti
good,"First of all, remember that this is an unskilled job. Every job at the lower levels is designed to be easy enough to learn for MOST people with zero experience. With that being said, the pay is fair, the health insurance is awesome, and as long as you work hard and make rate, they leave you alone. Tier 1 jobs (what most people start off as) are not designed to be long-term. You either promote up, move on, or take advantage of their tuition assistance if you can hold on to your job for more then a year. They also offer classes on how to make your resume look awesome and do mock interviews to help you with that as well."
good,"I did not like the management. However, the culture of the job was good. At the time, I was using public transportation in order to get to the shuttle that Amazon provided. The shuttle was late at times. As I tried to explain that to the management team, they delivered poor communication skills and lack of professionalism with me and terminated me due to the lateness of the shuttle they provided."
good,"This is a good place to work, 12 hour shifts, good people, and fun if you make it fun. "
good,It's just a simple job of having to pick and pack things in the truck and driving and delivering items to people homes or businesses. It's all you do for the rest of the day.
good,"It was easy to day dream as I walked all over the warehouse, since the job did not require many mental challenges. The biggest challenge was putting my mind on something creative."
good,"It's a good part-time job and the pay is good. I learned how to scan, sort and stow the packages. It's fast paced especially during prime week and peak season."
good,Good place to work if you like having 3 days off a week. Great benefits. lots of giveaways and games thru out the month. nice to meet new people and see products you may want to buy
good,"Good benefits and a livable salary for the work unless you are at the bottom where you work your tail off hopefully making rate. Management is either for 20 somethings or senior management for mba owners, rarely is this broken."
good,"trop de pression, mais bonne atmosphère de travaille"
good,If your going there cause the hourly pay and never worked warehouse your going there to fail cause there gonna work you for the 15 hr it's not gonna come easy. You may get comfortable with the 40hrs a week but when peak hits get ready for 60hr a week and sometimes 12hr shifts.
good,I worked as FC Associate at Amazon fulfillment center. The work is good for employees with experience. It needs from employees to work as a robots. Most probable you will get a hand or feed damage because of repetitive work environment for 10 hours. The good part is there is dental and vision benefits.
good,"it's okay, definitely not for the lazy. pay and benefits are good. Management is okay you get a new manager every few months. You work 10 hour days with 2 10 min breaks and a 30-minute lunch, and you are really there for 11ish hours because parking isn't all that great so you gotta get there somewhat early so you don't have to walk far."
good,Shifts are flexible but annoying to pick up.  Relaxed work environment. Management is relaxed no bosses breathing down your neck.  Work is fairly easy
good,"Life at Amazon is good at times, but is very fast paced and can get really stressful. You work four 10 hour days, with three  days off. You get your medical benefits from day 1 which is great. The constant change of upper management is in my opinion the worst thing about this company."
good,"Overworked"
good,Amazon was a good company to work for. Work was fast paced and well organized. Workers were friendly and very informative.  Also included perks such as benefits
good,Not a bad job at all! Something about work system has to be improved. Catching and tricky VET schemes specially during peak and holiday seasons. Slim chances for career advancements.
good,je trouve que travailler chez amazone est une bonne occassion d'apprendre plain de truc en plus de se remplir un peu les poches donc plutot satisfait
good,"Not the worst place not the best. "
good,"It's a okay job. Nothing really special about it, Extremely fast pace. No room given if you miss a certain amount of time you will be fired with no exception."
good,"Una delle migliori aziende del mondo, maniacali per quanto riguarda la sicurezza."
good,You have to stand for 12 hrs and climb stairs to get to the 4th floor. You need to walk at least 10 minutes to get to the break room and need to come back on time to your station in a 30 minute break. So basically you have 10 minutes to eat food.
good,I learned how to always put customers needs first. Always make sure customers demand is a must. I learned different things through out the company to succeed at my job.
good,Was hard do do pay was good but job very different from other jobs hate management was lack louster and no great hard work no reward and ppl were difficult to deal with
good,"Not a bad place to work, dress is casual and hours are easily changeable. It's a great temporary job if that's what you are looking for but also a good career, with the opportunity to advance quickly."
good,Management is largely disconnected and out of touch. The work environment isn't bad but the stale air and loud noise of a data center can burn you out quick. Amazon has no actual training program so get ready to do a lot on your own with little to no help. The pay and benefits are great and they do offset the disconnected work culture but hey its really up to the individual.
good,Amazon is fast environment and you can have either alot of fun working there or can be a miserable time. It's all based on you and your work ethic and ability to multitask. Highly diverse environment from experiences to ethnicity. Typically working 4/10 shifts (4 days a week 10 hours a day 3 days off)
good,"You can walk for miles and see no one but you make great friends. The foods ok. It I suggest you bring your own. "
good,"good job to make friends with co-workers and to meet new people. Hard to be taken seriously since there as much as 200 workers per shift. To rank up in amazon either you need to know a manager, or the head of HR. Every worker works as hard as they can, but only few rank up after 5 or 10 years of being working there."
good,The experience was good in order to develop a working mindSome of the management don't have the people skills to manage big groups of candidates . The whole atmosphere changes once the first batch of people start to get let go which start usually on the 23rd of Dec( shocking) and just carrys on from there like twice a week sacking 200 people in one go. So obiouvsly you are left feeling used.
good,"Typical day at work is long and repetitive, with hardly any room for error, and not much time on breaks. Although it sounds bad, if you can stick it the benefits outweigh the cons, and considering the simplicity in the application process and the work you do day to day it's easy money."
good,good money and benifets but you dont get treated fair.. things are disorganized and its stressful to work there.. time of task is a thing.. rates are high.. people can be very rude
good,"Long hours repetitive work. Use of steps 9.5hrs days make this job an absolute misery. Leaders regularly come with the motivation needed like 'you're under target, why?' Or 'you are too slow speed up no excuses' small percentage English speaking work place. No issues with team just out of place. Working 10hrs/4 days 3 off good for wrk/life balance. Overtime extra pay ££ if you can endure endurthe"
good,"Great place to work, close to where I live,good pay rates, vacations and personal hours paid, parental leave for mothers and fathers, good shifts....."
good,Worked non-stop. Most enjoyable time of day was when I was getting out. The co-workers were fun and the management was OK. Depending on who it was. Hardest part was making sure I made the numbers so I dint get fired.
good,"This is a very physically demanding job, and a very rewarding job. You definitely earn the money you make. Some managers are like drill Sargent others are great, as long as you do your job your good"
good,There were constant procedure changes without proper notice or training. Supplies and equipment were not readily available. There were too many people vying for available hours.
good,"Working in Amazon was a good experiance over all and made me  appreciate all the hard work which goes into delivering Amazon products. The job was very tiring with long hours, but the people working there were very nice which made the overall experience better. The hardest part of the job was meeting the deadlines as we had to fully package items in a very short period non stop. "
good,"Good if you need the extra cash. Bad if you actually need to make a living. That's all that's really need to be said about the company. It's a fair exchange, but you need to control."
good,"Good place to work. · Proficiency in Adobe Creative Cloud, including InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop"
good,"I was driving 60 miles, from home-work-home and paying toll. It was a good deal for me."
good,"Organized company."
good,"Pick Ticket Orders, Pulls warehouse items from the shelves based on number, size, colour, quantity, and quality requirements,  Ensures that orders are accurate, Stages items correctly for delivery, Operates handling equipment and ensures safety regulations are followed, Plans and monitors product storage and dispatch, Oversees stock replenishment, Monitors stock, control systems and processes specific orders, Ensures warehouse goals are met, Maintains a high level of health and safety standards, Shrink wraps products to pallets, Loads delivery vehicles, Packs warehouse orders as necessary, Operates scanners so that the proper order is picked and inventory is managed accurately, Performs other general warehouse duties as needed."
good,"The only negative thing is the job is just seasonal. So at some point you might not be needed any more as it happened to me."
good,The hardest part of this job is lack of communication with management. They underpay employees and work us until we want to quit. Amazon has the highest turn over rate in the country so far and that’s unfortunate to say. I enjoy my job duties and what I specifically do with the associates. Personally I wish their rules and allegations were different and the general manager was more supportive.
good,"Lavoro discontinuo e ben retribuito, altamente stressante."
good,they didnt work with me to get a fit job after getting hurt at there location had 2 shoulder surgeries from this place they didn't work with me . the cmh1 location I really enjoyed.
good,"It was a temporary job that I worked at. It wasn't great, but it also wasn't terrible. Had decent benefits as long as you were accepted into the company."
good,It totally depends on the immediate manager. Life becomes good/bad based on the manager.  I have learnt A LOT at amazon that I would not have learnt in any other company.
good,"Management is awful but other then that great place to work, Culture is good and there is an emphasis on team work which i really enjoyed. Overall job was just okay."
good,"Has a fun culture where they try to provide opportunity for development, however as it is with human nature and a bunch of people put together, the nasty side of our competitive nature seemed to be winning the corporate culture war. "
good,Al giorno ci sono circa un centinaio di consegne da fare e tramite controllo satellitare vedono se sei veloce  a consegnare. Se sei lento nel pomeriggio ti mandano un collega ad aiutarti. Si inizia presto al mattino per arrivare in zona consegna alle 8. Io da Burago andavo in provincia di Crema. Lavoro stressante ma ben pagato
good,Working at an Amazon Fulfillment Center is a fast-paced job that can become rather stressful. It was not worth the stress with the low pay and long hours.
good,"It is never easy to work at Amazon but you can learn a lot. Overall, it is a good choice to work for a few years at Amazon to improve the career. I recommend it."
good,It was a job. Work disappears and you're basically forced to go home in the slow seasons. Management is fine. If I didn't have to do BS busy work and I could do What I was hired for I'd still be there.
good,"I enjoyed my time at amazon, i learned a lot and made a lot of friends. Amazon is a very productive company to work for. The focus is always on the customer."
good,Ok place to work. . Fast paced environment.    Have to pick alot of items or u will get written up.long hours working and standing on your feet for twelve hours.
good,"It was a pretty cool job to work for, there just weren't enough hours. The management was pretty cool, the work was pretty easy. It did get busy at times but we always got the job done."
good,"It’s was really the hardest job I ever had to do. "
good,"Great place to work, with a lot of opportunity to progress."
good,"working at Amazon was a good experience, I enjoy working there its was a short term but productive, i like the fact that we could wear comfortable clothe."
good,"It's hard and busy work. Gives you a total body work out because it's fast paced with lots of lifting , standing and movement. Part time work is such (24hrs), but opportunities comes up to make more during Peak season. You're paid to the minute."
good,It was ok...over worked and underpaid the managers were all cool except for a few...there was alot of favoritism that was pretty obvious. I would not no more...
good,At the time the production expectations were in realistic. The plant culture was divided as it was a split between permanent employees and employees contracted through a temp agency
good,"I feel bitter because I was doing well on the graveyard shift here, training new employees and supervising the operation, and I got attacked by another employee and I dislike how they handled it. I was told to go home but the other employee was allowed to stay. A few days later, she was still showing up to work, so I had to call corporate and complain that nothing was being done. So they suspended us indefinitely for 3 months and when I came back they demoted me for reportedly not doing enough to deescalate the situation. I was in the middle of a panic attack from being attacked. I was just sobbing to myself."
good,"It's a warehouse job.  You will work hard and walk a lot, but they tell you that at the beginning.  You make it what you want it to be.  If you don't do the work, they won't keep you; plain and simple"
good,I truly jist went to work and home i minded my business had bills to pay nothing bad to say about the company. It was hard work though and all timed that sucked
good,"Leadership has a huge bias for young inexperienced workers being promoted over seasoned workers. Older workers are treated as inferior, second rate and expendable. If you have grey hair just know going in that you will always be last in line for advancing. Company boasts about so called (ownership) but took away stocks and attendance incentives in order appear generous with a supposedly higher wage."
good,"Productive and busy place of employment. Fast paced and stressful at times during peak season(winter holidays) "
good,It is what it it you can make the money but your going be too tired to spend it  co worker are nice and friendly but they are numbers driven and you have too keep up or you will be fired
good,"To stand out, you need to set yourself apart from your peers by being innovative, productive, and think outside the box. You are expected to work hard, but yet you can work with your manager to create barriers to protect yourself from burnout."
good,"Straight forward and decently easy to make production rate, but lack of upward movement and no recognition of going above and beyond the expected rate and no additional bonuses for doing over the needed work load."
good,Policies sucked and employee turnover rate was ridiculous. Mandatory overtime jumps your shift to 10 hours and leaving early is still seen as missing two hours of your normal day.
good,Very fast paced no room for errors. Not a lot of culture because of how fast you have to move. Short breaks and then get quickly back to work to complete all orders.
good,"Unorganized warehouse. Warehouse workers wouldn’t have your bags ready all the time. Rain and heat sucked when you were out there delivering. When you were done with your route, the dispatchers will make you rescue others which is fine but they expect you to do it everyday if you finish early and don’t get paid extra to do so. Let’s say you get 210 packages for the day and you have to do a rescue. You end up with a total of 250 since you pick up extra packages from the slow drivers"
good,"The job is good for what it is, a temporary job. It can teach you many things if you're looking for it and are willing to learn."
good,"Day Part -Time positions are only good if you need pocket change, not if you actually have bills. Especially if you work in the distribution department. If there aren't any packages to deliver, there's no work. You can decide to stay for a couple hours and scrape tape off the floors but that's about it. The attendance point system makes no exceptions for people with disabilities like me even when an proper work excuse is presented. But the people are friendly and it isn't hard work. Can get very hot or cold because well. it is a warehouse and those things don't get central air or a/c. You'll just have to duke it out with the other employees for one of the two floor fans when the ceiling fans aren't enough. Also, lots of dust, not recommended for those with allergies or irritable eyes."
good,It was an exciting and fun place to work. There is an game room to help relax before work or on breaks such as lunch. You have weekly meetings with a team lead that could just include playing ping pong.
good,It was a great place to work but it was to much stress. It's was just more than I could handle at the time. I was dealing with a lot while working there.
good,"Replaces a dipsh*t manager with an even dumber suck up, whether it be in a specific department or the gm. They only care about rates, but have no idea how to be efficient so they throw everyone out together. You will be required to drive a machine in 8/10 job duties, if you are not comfortable with it they will fire you. Good place to get benefits and money, but you have to deal with drama and stupidity"
good,"very accommodating, and respectable management. And such a fun environment and met lots of friends. I hope they have ways to systemize the 'team' effort per employee."
good,"Amazon offers a fun and safe work environment, but fails to offer competitive pay with other warehouses in the area. If you're applying for a tier 1 position their is no interview process, although beyond that interviews become very competitive and difficult to master."
good,"The managers for the most part are nice and reasonable.  However they rarely do anything about the huge amount of people that can't listen to the instructions about how to do the job, which just makes it harder for those that do listen & try to put forth honest effort"
good,it was okay but not the best lack of management sometimes the mangers don't do there job or care to help out alot of times there taking to many breaks and we don't get the help we need
good,"After Amazon raise their wage to $15 they cut part-time hours to the point of needing a 2nd job to compensate."
good,Every day was a new challenge. I was lucky to work on a good team. We helped each other to do a great job! The technology they use for tracking delivery was very interesting.
good,"I didn't have a problem with the time you had for lunch or the breaks. My only problem was how they ran things. They don't care about what employees feel or if they've been doing the same job for 55 hours a week, during peak, as long as you're still going, they'll keep pushing even if you ask to switch jobs for even a little bit. Or god forbid you gotta go to the bathroom a few times in a row. But other than that, I did enjoy the company and the jobs and the benefits."
good,It is a fast pace working job and I enjoyed it. I do not care for integrity the temp people they make extreme quote that associate can not reach and don't give enough time to fix your mistakes
good,"I have not worked at amazon long enough to give a real review of the job. It   was heavy lifting and pulling, scanning and cleaning involved. Short breaks, no phones or music."
good,"Working around the warehouse is fairly simple, Just don't get stuck with the scanning job. Scanning can be a very frustrating job if managed incorrectly But can be very rewarding also if you have a fun boss. They sometimes do giveaways and what not. They pay is good a great job for someone that only as a high school diploma or minimal job experience. The workplace is safe no problems really, accidents happen it is a factory, etc. You can make a career out of this job if you choose to which is a nice option but it wouldn't be as rewarding as you think. You get healthcare if you work there long enough but that's really it"
good,Company was meet nice ...and salary was awesome..but the work for some of difficult to deliver the package. Because of customer is not responding call
good,Could offer a bit higher pay for the workload and varying shift lengths. May be working what is technically overtime (won't get paid for) since our shift is only four hours. You also may get sent home two hours early. Never the same check twice.
good,"Good company to work there but the management is not good "
good,"It was a good place to come to for the time that I was there but I had to move on , to bigger more so I got into trucking and got a job a may t8 company"
good,"It's all depends on your team and manager. "
good,Amazon has good benefits but the pay for the work that you do is not enough and you don't get a cost of living raise at all. The most you will ever make with Amazon as an associate is 16.50 an hour
good,"Answering questions about anything and everything"
good,"First day is training to learn how to use the scanner, scan bin items and filling carts. Then you are able to continue on your own within the first hour. Then you are on your own filling your cart with purchased items ready to ship."
good,"Although the benefits are good and time-off options good,  I found I had to burn up my time off due to exhaustion!  I am fit and strong but the high volume/low staff rate has become unmanageable!  Go Go Go on your feet except for breaks, heavy, flimsy boxes, repetitive ""robotic"" requirements.  Need to spend more on labor, boxes."
good,"Company is good for starter job, but little to no room to move up in the company without a bachelors degree. Good work to life balance as you only work 4 days a week. Also good health care benefits."
good,I'm currently working at Amazon still looking for something with better salary  and a job opportunity  closer to home would before  nice I am willing to travel  for a job
good,Strict about bathroom breaks. You have to clock out for bathroom breaks and they will text you while you're in the bathroom. They will stay on you about meeting your minimums.
good,"Amazon is ok, wage slavery to be honest. But it is what you make it. The pay is not bad especially when you can work over 40 hours. During holiday season I seen people work up to 80 hours a week, just for the overtime pay. I wouldn't work there again. Not my type of job with me having a degree."
good,i would never work for amazon again they do not value their workers at all and they are very disrespect and demanding at all times and they worked us like salves and they did not even give us a proper lunch break and they did not treat they workers right.
good,"Amazon is the most efficient run company I've ever worked for. This is great for everyone but employees. Highly stressful at times, and besides holiday activities and bonus prizes and dinners(which are great), employees are far from treated like anything besides robot worker drones."
good,"Amazon was fair, safe, and paid well. it was hard work and the crowd were just anyone whom were transient at best. Couldnt feel that I would have moved up in rank at all."
good,"Everything there is basically for blue badge, nothing for the contract employees . Even if you work through temp you must meet up with your rates every day and every week. You can get terminated for slight mistake."
good,"Felt overworked at times, training seemed rushed but understandable. Was happy to leave because the pay did not match the work. I did like the seasonal part of the job tried going back, but at the last minute they told me I wasn't needed anymore, literally the day I was suppose to start after waiting almost a month."
good,"Long standing can cause feet to hurt. "
good,"If your joints hurt while standing, overweight or just plain lazy this is not the job for you. I dislike amazon because mostly only young people can do this physically demanding job as i watch all the older people get walked over and sent home and even fired for little things just because they cant keep up with demand. The pay is decent though and overtime is incredibly rare."
good,This job required a lot of walking. I was there for about 5 months and went through several pairs of shores. Breaks times do not take into account the walk time from ones work station to the front of the building: too short!
good,"Big number driven company. Short Breaks. Family/Life balance almost impossible as you're always sleepy or will sleep into the next shift. Overall, managers are energy driven, but will micromanage you."
good,"As part of their retail division, Amazon had a good goal with their stores that the opened. They believed that it would be a relaxed work environment and not your typical retail store. They believe that you should be able to provide the customers with the right information and let the customer make the decisions when they want to, and not be hounded as of other electronic stores. It was a great concept that they went with and we saw a big improvement with the numbers of customers that came in and loved it. The negatives were that Amazon has never been in the physical retail environment. The communication on when tasks and price changes were supposed to happen was horrible. Overall communication with how to do a certain task was not very clear. Found out many numbers that we called for support, had no clue that Amazon even had retail stores and didn't know what we were talking about. The biggest problem was the fact of marketing for the stores. The had NO marketing of the store to get people to come in. Many people found out about us through word of mouth. If they would have any marketing of the store, so people would know about it, they wouldn't have had to close all the stores. The overall thing about Amazon is the communication is not good and clear on what to do unless you keep asking and nagging to get answers."
good,"amazon is a good company to work for, they have good hours and offer decent pay, id recommend working for amazon to anyone who likes hard work and being a team player"
good,It's a fairly hard job during summer if you are not young. The managers will micromanage a lot to ensure you meet the rate which is not impossible but requires being constantly moving very fast. If you are not young or in shape you will be very worn down every day.
good,"Not a bad place, it had good hours and pay. I wish it wasnt so much discourse. Not easy to advance, it was in the beginning when it first opened up but not now. If you work hard, you will be recognized. They see mostly numbers though."
good,Laid back environment with good starting pay.  The work is demanding but not difficult.  Repetitive tasks can be boring and get old fast. There is a ping pong table though.
good,"I was a stower at Amazon for 2 years. My job was to scan inventory into locations where they could be retrieved when ordered by customers. Once fully trained all jobs at Amazon have to hit particular rates that the higher ups deem ""appropriate"". These rates are fixed so no matter what items you may be dealing with they must be stowed at the same speed. ANd ""feedback is received on a weekly basis."
good,Job can be reliable and consistent but management and you r position is all over the place changes are quick and very cut throat I don’t enjoy working here but it pays the bills .
good,"it was a job "
good,"After a couple of years, it's not worth it //Good pay, way above minimum wage as well with the pay rais // Mismanagement and poor communication can sometime be a hinderance"
good,"Place overall when I started almost 7 years ago was good and then trended down. Lack of management on the floor, no stocks or bonuses anymore, more robots being built to replace Associates, plus hardly any chance of moving up."
good,It was ok. I was a stow associate. I was on my feet from 10-12 hours depending on the time of the year. Great place to go if you need money. They have great benefits that start on your first day.
good,Amazon est une bonne entreprise avec d'excellentes possibilité d'évolution de carrière. Malheureusement le recrutement de la hiérarchie (pour mon cas) peu poser problème.
good,"Amazon is an ok place to work at as long as you like talking to people on the phone. Also, dealing with angry customers all day long. Working overtime if a large call volume is incoming or another site is down."
good,"Although working at amazon was stressful it was also very rewarding. They offered me training for my job, and it was very easy to understand. If I had not been in school then I would have stayed."
good,"No a whole lot to say, I was independent contractor.  We have no direct point of contact and everything is done through email and phone app.  I learned how to navigate the city and surrounding areas, since app would crash quite a bit."
good,Ok.....Twist and turning was very bad for the body it was ok I think the pay could be atleast 17 dollars per hour due to cost of living and better benifits.
good,Mission Trop court j ai travaillé chez eux à la période Du pic d’activité au moment des fêtes
good,"Al ser un call center, el trabajo era estresante y riguroso. Sin embargo el equipo de trabajo lo hacia una experiencia tolerable y hasta placentera en algunas ocasiones. La gente que trabaja en esta empresa es maravillosa, todos te reciben de buena forma y estan dispuestos a ayudar en lo que necesites. El trabajo en sí, no es muy disfrutable y es muy agotador. Lo que encontré muy negativo eran las estrictas normas como tener solo 10 minutos durante la jornada de 6 horas y media para ir al baño, y media hora de lunch para la cual habia que consultar antes de tomarsela."
good,Fun fast pace environment busy great experience but not a place I would like to spend my life working for. Company isn't for employees just managers..
good,"I worked at 2 locations and how you enjoy your job really depends on leadership. Worked at one loved it, but wanted to shoot myself at my 2nd location"
good,"Amazon was a temp. position. But even so, Amazon has provided me with a great work environment and an understanding staff. Occasional PTO and capless overtime"
good,"it's ok for some quick cash but not for anything long termed, i was over worked 50-60 hours per weak and not making a livable wage  for basic living expense."
good,"We worked long hours with minimal breaks. Warehouses are large so it takes awhile to walk from one end to the other, this is not accounted for in break time. Upper management always seems to be very stressed out."
good,"As full time you get unpaid time off 20h each quarter so total 80 but if your late or leave early they deduct time by the hour. Late 30 min one hour taken"
good,it was hard im always tired and stressed out mom look ok but need more support  and dignity and honor an respect  i think we all need some self worth.
good,"Good job to keep you active and motivated, breaks are short with pretty long shifts but once you get used to that it’s pretty easy. Wouldn’t have left it I didn’t have to relocate."
good,I have been working for Amazon for almost 4 years and have been in the same department since day one. The department is my favorite and I currently work at LGB4.
good,"Fast paced workplace, but an good environment to work in, as the people who work there want to work and want to get things done."
good,stressful but very easy work when there is work. alot of voluteer time off or be sent to dept. where you have no experience but are still rated and at risk to be fired for not making the rate..
good,A fast paced environment that cared more about the bottom line than the individual. They trained you for about half a day and then let you go on your own.
good,"Good employer, fast pace working environment with a lot of team buildung"
good,Working here is ok. The pay is good and that is pretty much the only motivation there is. Every job here is very easy to do but can be very repetitive. You have to keep up with rates which is also easy to do as long as the machines are working properly. ( Which is rare at times.) Management can be clueless at times. (You would be better off talking to HR.) Communication is very poor amongst management as well.
good,Ok place to work. Fast paced. The pay was good. Somethings are beyond your call. The management team would hold it against you if help is needed too often. They place you where needed and cut you off after they have used you up
good,"I worked during peak season, management seemed cold. The hours were long and there wasn't much time to socialize. Management seemed pushy and very strict."
good,"Was motivated while working there, enjoyed the pleasant working environment. For the most part, the staff was willing to be helpful and willing to assist when needed."
good,"- Upward Mobility"
good,"Pay is very good, but long hours. Early morning starts and, some of the managers won't allow you to take a 10-minute break from work. But I guess that's Amazon for you, you must be prepared to keep up with demand."
good,"It was a pleasure to work for Amazon, protective equipment was provided, technology errors were often mistaken for employee errors however, end of the day could get rather slow."
good,Its a good place to work if you can stand on your feet for long periods of time and able to lift more than 25 lbs. There’s career advancement opportunities and they have good benefits
good,"They change things everyday almost. We had a great morning shift, but they ended that. They pick anyone to be a manager. I guess with any job it's going to be something. Just all depends on what you can deal with."
good,"When I worked at Amazon it was 8 hours a day non stop walking on solid concrete for ok pay. It's an option if you need the money, not horrible. But there's better."
good,Long hours and brutal politics. Pays well enough to support a decent life and they consider cost of living in most places. Most of the areas the plants are located in are less than desirable.
good,"After a year and a half I’ve had enough, in spite of the company’s generous benefits package. Stowing work, whether individual items or pallets, is much too repetitive and mind-numbing over the course of a 10-hour shift. Conditions for success are not ideal most of the time given that an immense amount of merchandise is accepted into the warehouse, which makes finding space for stowing extremely difficult. That results in attaining the desired “rate” on which you are evaluated often impossible. That in turn puts your “good standing” status in jeopardy and can result in termination. Amazon may be world-class in ecommerce, but not overall warehousing best practices. The facility I was in generated a huge amount of damaged merchandise, perhaps in part due to hustled handling of goods. The facility aisles typically are trash-strewn resulting in entanglement and other safety concerns due to overstocking. Safety issues are usually addressed AFTER incidents occur. Opportunity for rotating assignments exists for only certain people. Best part was comraderie among peers."
good,I would load up my van with parcels. Optimize my route and complete my list of deliveries. I found it most enjoyable after completing my route and making all the amazon customers happy.
good,"the work culture was great to work n flexible which helps us give time to family ."
good,I worked partime at the MC05 location in Davenport  and the hours were flexible and the work was easy enough but the management was so immature and had there favorites and it was a lot of people not doing there job which made it harder on everyone else
good,Loved as a temp job while looking for better opportunity. Loved the hours and loved the people. Liked that I was able to learn to drive forklift and also picked items on floor.
good,"Very competitive shifts. Be on the Internet at the right  Moment to get shifts. Like a lottery game or a bingo,  someone got the shift before you even got the chance. Twenty employees compete for two or three openings. Not good!"
good,I liked the pay and the people and how laid back it felt at times although I did not like how it left me without a life outside of work. Also their HR team in my experience was not very good they never knew how to help nor were understanding.
good,"there's not too much to explain the job is exactly what you would expect going into it, you just turn up to work collect your parcels and then your off to deliver them."
good,"Lovely people, fun environment, not much room for progression as mostly only giving people temporary contracts and not giving many long term or permanent. "
good,"Hard work, I stayed with Amazon for five years, but decided  to go to school so I could change jobs. Good for the short term. Good pay. Boring work, depressing atmosphere."
good,It help to boost your customer centric as will able to speak to many types of people and find a way to get the things set right. And have help to know more in deep about customer needs
good,I was hired in as a tier 3 in operations- I was basically thrown to the wolves. I went from an operations role to a support role (trainer) I had a much better experience. If you have a great work ethic and want to move up fast Amazon is for you.
good,"Typical day included checking emails, gathering list of bottom performers to work with and train associates in different paths. Held occasional classes and lead onboardings"
good,Learned a lot about current methods of distribution and gained significant experience learning to lead teams and maintain quality control. Taught me about stress control.
good,"Packing boxes, Pulling pallets delivering boxes, filling the orders to be boxed. Keeping my work area clean. Loading boxes on trucks for delivery. Doing whatever was needed to keep my area moving smoothly."
good,A very interesting company to work for with a very unique and peculiar corporate culture. Not for everyone but definitely a rewarding experience that lead to a great deal of growth.
good,"Simple taskwork, managers can get on your behind about small things. Breaks are carefully watched, as is lunch. "
good,Work there was fast paced and a lot of heavy lifting. Only issue was no placement for me when I was injured and manager was rude at times. I also had issues with the way we clocked in at times.
good,"Diverse working culture.Typical day at the delivery warehouse is scanning packages, dispatching the routes, talking to drivers, housekeeping side duties. Must be able to lift 49 lbs."
good,Fast Paced from time you clock in till time you clock out.  Distribution center is huge and takes time to get a routine down to understand where you are going.
good,Very intense experience trying to consistently meet picking quotas while walking up to 15 miles per shift or more. Sometimes the quotas were impossible.
good,productive and fun work place to be at with alot of people to make friends with.they take safety seriously . and also productivity and quality is extremely important.
good,I worked there in the peak season thorught addeco so we didn´t get any benefits from Amazon. We finish everything so fast and then there was nothing to do just walk around retending you are doing something. It was nice to learn how does Amazon works. We use high-end technology devices. I learnt how to use the tools to move goods.
good,Too much standing and walking on the job that can have adverse effect on employee after work. I would not recommend working as a warehouse associate to my friend I would implore them to go and get education.
good,"As a Courier for a 3rd party company for amazon, Its not easy work. You're on the road any where from 8 to 12 hours a day depending on work load. Every day is different. You will always and I mean ALWAYS have not one day be the same. In my location (Rochester, NY) management is very cool. Only issue with this facility is that it seems they will hire anyone that's alive, just to do grunt work. The warehouse associates are complete idiots, loading your van is a nightmare some days, literally elbow to elbow... were hassled to load our Van's in the 30 min time frame were allowed.. it's a pain in the butt. A positive thing I can say about this job is that management are very cool people, people will be sent out to help you if your workload is making you fall behind. The BIGGEST issue I have with this job is that you have to walk on eggshells in the sense that customers can complain for dumb reasons and you have to face the reality of potentially losing your job, even if it is a stupid reason. Good money for an entry level job, just alot of hassle and anxiety that comes with it. Also cool to be by yourself delivering, but you will definitely talk to yourself. I've been here 4 months and I am the last 10 original employees here since I started in Jan. They've hired 40 ish new people."
good,"Working with amazon was good experience however, it was hard work, and it required constant physical strenght. It involved carrying have loads an packing them."
good,"I worked at Amazon for 7 years."
good,Good pay if you put the hours in with overtime. Long hours with repetitive work. Management do try to keep it fun though. Good incentives through the year and good progression opportunities if you work hard.
good,"Amazon is a decent company to work for if you're just looking for a paycheck. This isn't a place I would recommend to someone looking for a career. The work environment is stressful, but the pay is good enough to deal with it until you can find something better."
good,"Amazon pays very well, although the stock compensation is less appealing recently.  They have a lot of fringe benefits like participating in a lot of beta programs that can be very cool.  The problems are meassive, the opportunities to make a difference are huge. Work-Life balance is poor. You will regularly work weekends, get calls after hours and on holidays. Especially if you work in the retail area your Thanksgivings and Christmases will be lost. The company will tell you the days of stack ranking employees is gone but that is true in only the strictest terms and is very much done in practice if not in policy."
good,"From your day-1, you are instructed on where to go and you will generally stay there for a while. From there, you can expand your knowledge or, if you like where you're at, grow and teach others in your job. My direct managers were always a big help to my carreer advancement, though upper management was usually very distant and ignorant of their subordinates."
good,A typical day you clock in start the work day. I learned how to teach people how to do a certain job in the facility. Management was constantly telling me about my rate and how fast i should be thats the hardest part of the job being very fast. The most enjoyable part is the benefits that come with the job and how convenient it was to my life.
good,"Worked at Columbus delivery center (DCM1). Overall a positive experience but not enough hours/pay to keep me there. Good diverse bunch of coworkers, managers (mostly, see below); the systems they use seem very faulty or they are being tweaked constantly, so work methods changed a lot. It's a credit to the workers that anything gets out the door there on a daily basis. "
good,"Amazon was a pretty good job, but I just wanted to try something new and start a new chapter in my life. With the best of my abilities I will do whatever it takes to satisfy the customers."
good,"Ok, I worked on a movie, Love & Friendship, Amazon distributed so I can't really speak to Amazon in-house office culture.  However, they were great to work with on this movie and I'm glad they made it."
good,Get there on time and deliver packages in timely manner. Faces challenges in some neighborhood and had cops pulling you over due to thinking you are robbing.
good,working there was different. You have to receive product and put it in the computer. Worked 10 hour days. The most fun part of the job was learning new things.
good,Clock in and then got to stand up . Then you will Stretch and go to your area where your day would get started . It's simple but you have to mindful that you must wear your PPE.
good,Always pushing managers to the breaking point. High turnover rate. Managers were always being rated against each other which lead to a very cut throat environment.
good,I transferred to another department struggled with production rate was allowed to go back to packing after 2 months of asking and approved from upper management was terminated because of 6 write ups within 12 month period which I received 5 from the dept I was struggling in before I went back to packing.
good,A day at Amazon is a workout all by it self. Management can do a better job of directing people in the right direction and not play favorites with individual's who come to Amazon to work and earn their way up the chain of command.
good,i did not learn anything training was horrible culture was fake management is not the greatest they cut your lunch to short typical work day would be constant walking
good,Not an ideal job to have permanently but as it was only temporary it was fine. Can be quite tiring as work nights so doesn't leave much for a social life
good,was good for a part-time job but the hours I worked there wasn't enough work to go around. So some people were asked to go home. The place could have been run a little better.
good,Received and opened ‘returned’ merchandising packages to verify contents and condition of merchandise being returned. The management team was very involved.
good,Empresa exigente con horario donde era dificil conciliar vida laboral y profesional
good,"It was very busy during the Christmas season. Many opportunities for over-time. Fast-paced environment. A lot of bending, pulling, wrapping, squatting, and walking."
good,"It was a different experience. Picking up multiple orders going to multiple locations, helping complete the supply chain for customers who utilize the ""Prime Now"" services that Amazon has to offer."
good,"Not hard job, but you can feel most of the time nervous because they ask you to do your job so fast and in the same time they need high quality. I had tried to learn mor about my job and move to another department to learn more but no one respond."
good,"As far as productivity is concerned, Amazon is one of the fastest growing companies today, but what people don't realize is how stressful a typical warehouse associate job is in terms physical and mental labor. Even though the managers there are super-friendly and helpful and the colleagues are easy to work with, it still doesn't help you get over the fact that the shifts are just too long and painful to work through. The only enjoyable part of the job is winning prizes for weekly contests, or your average 30 min breaks."
good,na poziomie średnim prosperójoca miła atmoswea wspaniałe grafiki
good,"It’s a very large company, fast pace working, always work to do, they have plenty of shifts it’s a great job to have if it’s your first job and it pays great"
good,"Typical day at work included using an order picker and RF scanner to pick orders. Walking/standing throughout entire shift. physical, fast paced. Most enjoyable part of the job was the working for a startup (at the time) in a unique warehouse setting"
good,"10 hrs of walking, Forty hour work weeks, Must make daily quota which is not hard to do, usually get a raise every six months, really good place to start working for 1st job"
good,"A typical day at work not a bad job it’s ok coworker are very easy to work with, everybody worked ,as a team when the time for team work was at hand ."
good,"Working at Amazon Sort Center is fun and at the same time fast-paced. It's a good part time job. If there are days you don't feel like working, there are always VTO being offered and also you are given 20 hours of Unpaid Time Off (UPT) every quarter."
good,"It's not too bad but you'll have no life in between, you're working just to work to be fair. The food is practically the same everyday and way too expensive for that matter. It's very repetitive but great pay especially if you're trying to save up."
good,"It is great job opportunity, it’s a bit competitive for work hours but it’s an easy job once you. It’s a laid environment and everything is done online, including scheduling shifts"
good,We move box off a truck onto a belt that takes it to big iron to be shortened to it's row. Sent the the pick offs who put the boxs to it's row number to be scanned into it's bag to be shipped out.
good,"amazon can be a great place to work if you are favorited by management, if not it is not worth the stress and hours. During peak season you work 60 hours a week. little to no room to grow as promotions are not based on your direct managers opinion."
good,Très bonne ambiance et rappel des conditions de travail tous les jours pour la sécurité de tous le monde.
good,"it was a good experience overall and pretty easy. manager was nice but pay wasnt that good, is good if you want a part time type of job, and thas it that ill say."
good,"Amazon is a very fast pace business, standing on your legs for 10 to 12hrs, using your hands lifting heavy items, packing at a rate level and if you don't meet that rate you are fire.  Treated unfair by supervisors and Human Resources.  Would I come back?  Yes but delivering mail."
good,"Very fast paced, had just opened when I started, it was very unorganized at the time and the pay was not enough for full time it was side job pay and I needed a full time job so I left"
good,it is very watching in every action you take. A day you was sign in and do your work. There were rules like other places and someone always tracking the quota.
good,"Great team to work with and working hard to make difference to benefit our customers."
good,Ma mission m'à permis d'évoluer en quasi autonomie.
good,"Good for a temporary or side gig with low expectations. Scheduling is competitive. Shifts are posted nightly, online, during a ten-minute window.  No guarantee of work as shifts fill very quickly,"
good,Rates are hourly and you receive compensation for how many hours you work. Overtime is expected during the holidays. What you see is what you get as a fulfillment specialist.
good,"working at amazon was nothing special, working in the warehouse is stressful, they provided were limited hours, lots of new employees, managers need to be retrained."
good,company gave our snacks and xmas prizes  Company would let other co workers  about your rate that should be personal. employers would hide boxes with large amounts to meet their rates.  Man cleaning ladies bathroom inside bathroom with ladies are using bath room he should step out
good,When I was working amazon I was sortie out boxes putting them in the right place and the I was labeling them so people won’t confuse on the boxes.....
good,"I worked hard, but it was not good enough.  Items were very heavy and their expectations not reasonable unless you are young and strong.  I saw people cherry picking the cages, standing around talking and going to the rest room multiple times a day.  They don't take into consideration when items are heavy or work availability is not there.  Some management is good.  It was not a fun place to work.  It was also my fault because I cared about quality of my packing, they just care about quantity."
good,"A typical day at amazon to me would be that I am a stower, so I scan the packages into bags for various routes. Sometimes we are very busy other days we are not. We have two teams of managers. One of them works on the floor the others work off. I would say the managers on the floor work very hard to help out wherever they are needed. One thing I like about this job is that they offer ""V.E.T"" which basically means we have to many people for the quantity of shipment we need to process, so they will offer people the chance to leave early."
good,"great place to work but salary is very less."
good,Amazon was a nice place to work for. I was able to meet people who came from different states to work three months at a time. The only problem was that  was cold we had to wear  jackets due to no heat in warehouse and when it was hot we had to wear tank tops and shorts to stay cool.
good,"In my short time at Amazon (3 months) my shift had been changed three times, not including the change from the applied shift to the one I received. I went from 25 hours a week to 20 after being told the shift I was scheduled for ""didn't exist."" despite it being an alternative to the shift I had applied for. They often ran out of work (not including sweeping/maintenance) for us to do and would frequently offer to send people home. Some times they would send out alerts to offer for you to take your shift off before you went in. My gripe with this was there were multiple times management had expressed dissatisfaction with people showing up when they had tried to keep people home to save on labor due to a slow day."
good,Depressing tiring work environment where staff are worked for too long without enough breaks. Looking forward to the end of the day and weekly pay is the only benefits or working for this company.
good,"Just a normal work place, good rates of pay for overtime. Fast paced environment. Not 100% if you'll get a permanent contract, if you're okay with temp work this shouldn't be a problem."
good,"Ok until working schedule was cut. Management was very nicely organized until a big change was made, a new manager come in cutting hours and hiring more part time employees to save on benefits making it impossible to support my family or anyone for that matter."
good,"Long hours without food/not allowed to carry food inside the warehouse."
good,Amazon laid me off because I am seasonal employee they told me that we will convert you to permanent  but they didn't. Short breaks 15 min break when you almost bought something from vending machine  and u gonna to eat it you find alarm says break is over  yah
good,A job like any other. It is as bad as everything you heard but so long as you go in with low expectations you can keep it up until you're injured or find a better job.
good,"I'm not writing a review over this. 34 characters really. Ok. Doubt thou the stars are fire, Doubt that the sun doth move. Doubt truth to be a liar, But never doubt I love."
good,Amazon is a great company to work for when you start your career. Lots of learning opportunities across the globe and and Amazon provides flexibility to move across Amazon offices with ease. Probably not a very good place for tenured people.
good,"The position I worked was a virtual call center, No dress code, rarely on camera. the company is really good with accommodations for nursing/breastfeeding moms. Love that part. The management is pretty disgusting, lack of communication."
good,It was a job nothing more nothing less. I was not really making it with the job do to its seasonal demands. I often felt like I was thrown into an ocean of sharks of only a couple days of training. as soon as that was up it was like they were like here as the shove it your face expecting you to know exactly what to do only on a couple days of training.
good,My Amazon experience is mixed because I have worked at 2 facilities. The one in PA was run much better and managers worked for to help you succeed but in SC they are not as organized and managed the same way.
good,"The first day in amazon is very happy and the workers in company very honest and they talk me very honest, I learned in amazon more thing about design and how work it filxable and I learned about the work with every workers in the company"
good,Panama shift schedule is not ideal for myself and struggled to get my head and mind set around it. Fed lots of false hope about progression to claim higher and get more skills. Fellow work mates make the place bearable as it can be a depressing place some days. Work hours are long for the amount of work required to do.
good,"Don't respect your 15 min break time. Its really needed. Some don't even know how to help if you needed it. Its horrible trying to reach hr. Because, everything is online. You'll never get the same answer from managers. They all tell you something different."
good,"I worked at one of Amazon's delivery stations. I was surprised on day one when I realized that the employee who was training me was less prepared than I was. I expected more from a company as reputable as Amazon. Job duties vary by shift, but most of the work is manual labor. "
good,good place to work and they just increased their minimum wage. What i like most is that there's room for advancement and growth to higher positions with this company.
good,"It was fast pace, it was good for what it was at the time. I went through integrity staffing and it was a great experience. We had to work 40 hours a week and sometimes overtime being mandatory which was insane, running around the building and walking anywhere from 15 to 25 miles a day was hectic."
good,In my honest opinion i am underpaid and overworked because of an inconsistent system giving bigger drop offs to random people and smaller ones to some.
good,"Aside from the few coworkers that brighten your day, most of the time spent there is being pushed to do they same task at a faster than average pace for a 10 hour span."
good,"Working inside an Amazon warehouse, selecting, packing and shipping customer orders. It's a fast-paced, physical position that gets you up and moving."
good,"I would go in for a ten hour shift, which would require that I pack boxed orders and send them down the shipping line.  I would scan every order and ship accordingly.  I would get two fifteen minute breaks and a half hour for lunch."
good,This place has the best environment. The people you work with are amazing.  It's like getting paid to enjoy working out. Just be sure to wear a pair of comfortable sneakers while doing so.
good,"amazon is all about the business.  numbers must be maintained hourly, equipment problems, time off task, when there is no work they send you home.  "
good,"Brakes are too short, and canteen is way to far away from place where you working. Sometimes heavy and oversized boxes need to be handled by hands. Overpriced and not tasty food"
good,a typical day at work just going to work getting the job done. what I have learned is how much items they had to produce. the management was great. work place culture was very well maintained. hardest part of the job was dealing with the garbage. most enjoyable part of the job was just having fun with the employers getting the job done to make the day go by quicker.
good,Be prepared for light to hevy items at all times. Your personal rates for your department maybe extremely high. Amazon does have good Benefits and Discounts with other companies.
good,"I like the job bec. it is very easy, and pay is good $15 hr. Some PA's are lazy, standing around talking to colleagues. The worst part is they laid off people if the company gets a low rate of orders. If its slow, you get to work for short hours a day like 2-3hrs."
good,Hard work and keeps raising the rates.Work is very hard and demanding. Timed on everything you do and cannot be off task for over 5 min. So go to bathroom  quick.
good,Le giornate di lavoro sono interminabili e ti senti continuamente sotto pressione.
good,"This place works you hard for a small pay but their benefits are great. I heard they have a pay increase now so maybe now it is worth it! I couldn't bring my phone in the break room, which is another thumbs down but to each is own."
good,"Job was once great and paid well. now they have hired so many drivers, work is really hard to come by since you are competing with a lot of people for work."
good,"not a bad company to work for, some of the management needs more training, some the managers I dealt with on a daily bases where outstanding,  I think the company needs to focus on quality managers"
good,Amazon is a company where you can learn new opportunities and be able to further your experience. Now I can utilize the knowledge that I learned from the company else where.
good,Fast paced work environment that had advance work opportunities but was limited. Long work days at a minimum of 10 hours a day but pay was not bad.  The hardest part of the job was listening to the scanner gun all day.
good,"was a great work place and learned a lot from co workers and managers."
good,Loved how strict yet fun and lose enough for employees to really want to get up and go to work. Loved how they have extra hours or anyone who wanted to work or needed the hours.
good,"Was never intended as a permanent job for me, so I can't really say how the atmosphere of the workplace would change long term. There were multiple positions available."
good,"You'll be spending all of your time standing and walking. Most working days end early save for the holiday season where you'll be working 10+ hours daily. "
good,"typical company, good management, easy parcel delivery, but acctually small payment without oppurtunity for more income, not very heavy parcels, small vans."
good,a typical day at work is very busy and everyone go on to their task. management is okay to be fair. the workplace culture is good and diverse. .The hardest part of the job is having less training and learning everything on your own.
good,"Challenging working environment but great opportunities. High stress environment with limited oversight, but incredibly smart colleagues and interesting work."
good,The pay is good but during slow season there may not be a route for you when arriving to work. Also there are no benefits and no breaks. this job can be stressful at times.
good,"Amazon is a faced paced work environment that never slows down , it’s not the job for you if you have young kids. You are guaranteed hours but the breaks are not promising."
good,Working in Amazon is a great experience i had before because it’s have a productive and fun workplace. Then it had a easy account that i have because i do take also the order of the customer thru online.
good,This place would be great if they didn't get rid of people after certain periods of time and if they got rid of the point system.The point system is not good during winter time. Unexcused absences occur because of the weather and they last for 90 days. It also takes them a while to remove a point if you proved your absence was excused. Also you should be able to choose which area you want to work in if you are not liking the area they put you in.
good,"I worked the night shift and the day shift. The building was clean, great co-workers. The management team was helpful to the employees. Great benefits."
good,C'était bien et agréable. J'ai aimé travailler là-bas j'y retournerais volontiers
good,"J'ai eu une bonne expérience en travaillant chez amazon, mais ce qui m'a le plus dérangé c'est de ne pas avoir pu évoluer au sein de l'entreprise. A plusieurs reprises, j'ai demandé à passer des formations (autres que la formation initiale) et cela n'a jamais abouti, j'ai postulé pour un poste de nuit, rien, j'ai demandé le CDI et toujours rien."
good,"Not treated like employees, nothing to say. Too much competition hired in our area to make any money as a contractor. You never know when blocks would drop so you waste your time swiping all day to get a 3 hour block, it's crazy."
good,"you don't have a boss so it's quite nice."
good,"Today, sales are small, fees are taken out, customer service has seriously dropped.we have very little chance to defend ourselves against negative reviews, and are required to pay for return shipping when a return request comes in, no matter what the reason. If receipt is slow by usps, we are blamed and Amazon will not erase it. It has become, This has seemed to change within the past couple of years. We used to be able to get message right to the buyer, now they barely go through. The last 6 I've sent have not received a reply and these are messages are not received. It completely changed and now caters to the buyers and sellers are not given any recourse. I have learned so much about grading books, calculating weights. postage rates, sending different packages at different weights, how to navigate Amazon and ebay and how to have patience with some very difficult customers, and much computer work. We've learned how to package professionally. I started it when our son needed textbooks for college and asked a seller how he found such cheap books. Sometimes we're lucky and make a profit, sometimes we don't."
good,It was a decent place to work and provided decent wages. It was a sort of impersonal place to work and had minimal contact with management. Appreciated the fact that they payed higher wages for nights and weekend shifts. .
good,Delivery driver are treated like day labor workers... not cool especially when they are the ones delivering amazon packages to customers front door.. they need more pay and benefits. Also there many drivers are placed on one driver... it causes injuries overtime and rough on body
good,"Many opportunities to develop and grow. Promotion is always a motivation, but need to show value as well."
good,"A fairly decent place to work. Don't like the down time. Rotating weekends, or set schedule with 4 days on 3 days off. It sounded good. I thought I would like it but I don't. Hard to find a part time job on your days off."
good,"The worst thing I noticed about working at Amazon was the favoritism along with that the biggest issue was that one of the managers came around with a note pad  asking for new ideas to introduce that I thought  would help everybody. So I gave them the idea to let employees switch shifts and or days off with other employees At that time I was the only person who came up with that idea as the manager stated.  In the next month or so there was a meeting in the lunch room, to recognize employees for their good deeds etc. There they announced they would open the option for shift mingle which was my idea. They neglected recognize me for that idea. I decided to just let it go its not like a would have gotten  anything other then envious, jealous jabs at my back by old heads. Amazon is great company to work just pick the right location with the right management and if you have an idea make sure you get credit for it. If a woman doesn’t want load   Management  pretty much guilt trips you or straight up tells  you to switch so that the woman or  man sometimes Can now launch boxes at your head from the divert line."
good,You walk alot inside the warehouse.  Need to drink alot of water. And always be on time to work. Work at your own pace. And be consistent  and work as a team
good,"i worked for amazon for over 4 years and I was always treated like a number, not a person. Never getting told ""good job"" only getting told ""this isn't good enough""."
good,"Draining, I need new work experience. Don't really like being in a building with no windows. And theres barely any opportunity to improve besides being a manager. But being a manager at amazon is something I don't have any interest in."
good,"amazon is a good place to work, they offer many benefits and they train everyone before any type of work, so you know what to do. Also the people working at amazon are very friendly."
good,"Although Amazon is a good place to make money working, their rate expectancy is too high. Yes I did work hard in stow but I could never make rate. However, the other deparetments were also very nice as well."
good,"Productive you had to be ready for anything, the managers made it fun.You worked hard but were rewarded for it. Things were always changing which made it interesting."
good,it wasnt bad it was a desent job it had its ups and dones but it was fair enough the job was to competitive and thats all they cared about was speed not there employees
good,Fun environment but poor management didn't really support the people just work non stop with no breaks overall good kitchen and the other then that alright company
good,"It was a perfect work environment, fast pace friendly a little loud most of the time but other than that it was ok. Has great benefits and pays very well."
good,"Not a bad place to work, however the shifts are long and the pay isn't the best. Managers can be unreasonable at times. The best thing about working here is the people you work with."
good,"hours were flexible, management in accounting is tempermental, very high volume of work, segragated job duties, minimal training, system can be difficult"
good,"A lot of stress to your hands, feet, knees and back.  They have a medical department on-site.  It may not seem hard but picking 400 items per hour is a lot on your body to do for 11 straight hours"
good,"Did not like working there.  Too dirty, too much heavy lifting, stressful work environment.  Always being told to pick up the pace.  Won't do it again."
good,"Working 4 days out of 7 days a week is great at times for 3 straight days off but during works days you'll usually be too tired to do anything but work, sleep and eat."
good,"Si sentivano un sacco di leggende su quest'azienda (braccialetti, dipendenti maltrattati, ecc). Io son stato assunto per il picco di Novembre e Dicembre, e chiaramente licenziato alla fine di suddetto picco (vengono assunte molte persone che non ha senso mantenere a fine picco)."
good,Il lavoro ben impostato e organizzato ...stimolante per la crescita lavorativa nella gestione del materiale
good,Good option for someone looking for extra income with major flexibility. No issues in the workplace so far. Easy pickup and easy to follow directions from supervisors.
good,"the location is too far for me, also a temporary job you have to do long hours standing shift which is I don't like in night shift scheduled. the workplace is very fast and stressful as well."
good,"Very intense culture of ""get it done now"".  Sometimes speed overshadows doing a good job.  Be ready to do things that you thought were not possible - challenged to be at your best all of the time."
good,3 out of 5 stars yay great job was far and they fired me for some bullcrap they had claimed that I had left the building on the clock and came back when in fact I put in some PTO then left but the stupid machine malfunction and didn't properly enter the PTO that kiosk had been having issues I had heard directly after that....why I have to review something like this to verify my account is just silly
good,Very strenuous work.. You will be exhausted. The pay rate is good. The sight I worked at always offered VTO..Be prepared to work ur butt off literally.
good,"I need to do something with my degree, the work I do is not relevant to my education level. I cannot settle, I will find better jobs all the time with no hesitation."
good,Very good  company in Hyderabad .. company provide all the facilities according to employees ..good ceo .. according to employees company is well developed
good,"You get good benefits, decent pay, and a lot of opportunities for time off but it gets incredibly boring and repetitive. You're just stuck doing the same thing for about 9 hours our the day 4-6 times a week. Advancement takes forever to get and they cut your breaks short, overtime is essentially mandatory just because the other shift didn't finish their work so you're stuck doing it."
good,"This was a fast paced environment where you had to be prepared to go go go. The  best part is the salary, working overnight is 21 an hour and working during the day is 15 an hour."
good,"San Marcos is too far from Austin. Not enough pay. The 2 hour drive is inconvenient. The inviroment is really nice to work at, it’s just that the salary is at $10.00 per hour. Not enough income to live in Austin."
good,"Das Arbeitsklima bei Amazon war sehr angenehm. Neben den netten Arbeitskollegen, hat die Arbeit Spaß gemacht. Dort wird an einem Strang gezogen und jeden geholfen. Ich selbst habe nur gute Erfahrungen gemacht."
good,"A lot of heavy lifting, minimal hours, and not a lot of opportunity to advanced within the company. Management was good, but the cleanliness of the restrooms was horrendous."
good,"lots of physical activity "
good,not everyone is good for the jobs that they assigned. not everyone can get used to the rates with out slaving them. if they can't make rate they get fired especially as a picker.
good,Enjoyable place to work but some things are done in a way that feels like they are against you. This is a place where you realy need to make sure you keep record of things.
good,"Working in amazon is very tasking and require alot physical strength and meeting a %100 productivity."
good,"My experience at Amazon was monotonous, and predictable. After a short morning meeting we would begin stowing for ten hours a day with two paid fifteen minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. I learned about the inner workings of Amazon, but not much else that would help me in any other work environment. The manager turnover was very high, and changes were often implemented in my work process. The hardest part of the job was staying motivated, as hard work was often overlooked, and the job was repetitive. The most enjoyable part of the job were the benefits. The insurance coverage was great, and the time off was too."
good,"Great Company to learn a lot REALLY quickly and you definitely work on projects that make an impact.  However this great work comes at a cost.  Amazon is very upfront that the price for the great compensation and interesting projects is the VERY demanding environment that you work in that requires constant results.  It doesn't matter what you did yesterday...every day is day one so you must constantly deliver excellence in a relentless manner.  You will sacrifice family time/personal time for your career.  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  However, it is the choice you make for the great opportunities that Amazon can bring for you."
good,"Slow paced. Not enough work in the satellite warehouse I worked at. I was sent emails basically everyday for VTO. I wanted to work for this company, but when i felt like there wasn't enough work I just used VTO everyday."
good,"Amazon is great place to work as a beginning job. The benefits and pay are good. There is a big emphasis on safety - which is good. My biggest problem is the work environment. It is very cut-throat and overly competitive. In order to fill your quotas you have to often be less safe, ""cherry pick"" easy orders, or often take from other employees. The emphasis on quotas also creates a stressful environment. The training is quite quick. The overall managers are friendly;  but the quota-stress and data driven analytics leaves them little room for personal discernment. The work can be difficult, long hours, and many miles walked in a day. A person will be sore for a couple of weeks until their body gets used to the work and hours."
good,In starting it feels hard. Gradually it will be fine. Batter then other warehouses. A lot of opportunities to grow. Shipping department is easiest of all.
good,It is an exciting place to work because they are always doing something new. Hope they can be flexible with employee schedules enabling them to contribute remotely
good,"A typical work day consists of selecting, picking, and staging shopped items, which are hand- picked. Expect a quick paced environment, with a few slow days. Holidays and certain weekdays the pace is extremely quick. As a team expect to pick a total of 500 or more items daily. "
good,Focus on no mistakes is fun but extremely intense. Long hrs mandatory black outs. Vto after peek no 40hrs after New year. Learning opportunity and great benefits
good,Amazon has a lot of cons.. the will hopefully be fixed.. i personally Will never work for amazon again & i dont see myself reccomending them as a workplace to anybody.
good,"I had a few problems with some of the policies at Amazon. "
good,Amazon was a great place to work but per policies it really sucked. A doctor gave me three days off because i was sick with flu like symptoms but amazon needed me to have a 7 day excuse.
good,Over a pretty good  Never had a problem always made rate Some supervisors are willing to work with you Fair pay good benefits   Long hours Very comprehendible  The only problem was I couldn't work weekends anymore did not have no daycare so I had to leave
good,Temporary pt position - safety is a priority with Amazon.  Learned effective use of scanning technologies/ work place efficiency and working with a very diverse workforce.
good,it was ok but the pay was to low for all the job duties we had to do . we had to load trailers by hand off an  belt. they would switch you off what u where doing to do something else.
good,"It’s so strange that I wanted to work for this company for a long time, when the opportunity came around I was stoked...... then reality set it this place is run like a sweatshop, falsified offer letters and a 10 min break for 5 hours of work. Eye opening that a company I loved to order items from is ran like this. Unrealistic hourly quotas, managers yelling across the Warehouse( no one really ever understands what they are yelling about) too many new hires in one area, everyone is stepping on each other and it’s counterproductive......"
good,A typical day at work there was stressful and long. I learned a lot of safety benefits. The management was never around never met anyone except for my supervisor. the culture was stressful and not welcoming. The hardest part of the job was standing in one spot alone for 12 hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay.
good,"A typical day is busy, you are working in a fast paced environment throughout the whole shift which can be as long as 12 hour days. The work itself is straight forward and for the most part even enjoyable. You are for the most part working independently, and sometimes sent to work different roles throughout your assignment. These are all things I enjoy about the job, however, they are very strict in terms of calling in, or being late. Unlike most places they operate on a point system, and if you get so many, you are let go from the job. Even being a few minutes late from break can result in being docked points, which I feel is a bit too cut-throat for my liking, you really cannot afford getting sick. Considering there are positions in which you are in the very back of the building. The problem with that is having to travel through the large warehouse, get scanned coming out, also back in, which all digs into your 15-minute break. There are times because of this, I was only able to enjoy about 3-5 minutes of that break."
good,"Get there and clock in"
good,Very fast paced environment. They demand to much from their employees. If you can do it more power to you. People are nice there or than that I enjoyed my opportunity
good,"Customers can be very rude and demanding. Must be customer oriented, level headed. They take their frustration out on you, therefore you must be able to think quick and know the Amazon computer system very well so that your not slow for the customers."
good,A typical day at work is that we would go in and call leads and tell them about an online business that we were offering. I enjoyed the atmosphere. It was laid back
good,Can make money but won’t have a life to do other things. Can be stressful during holiday season. Good benefits and also takes time to adjust to the work environment
good,"It is a nice place to work, you get overtime, and the pay is decent, but I will recommend only for college students .and don't apply for the driver it"
good,Fun place to work until the holidays as it gets busy and must work really fast in order for the clients to have access to their package on time as Time is essential.
good,It was harsh and very physically demanding. There was little regard for how people coped with many aspects of it but it was also well paid. They tried to provide certain services such as a bus and cafeteria to make things easier for us
good,"It was good for me to work in Amazon. The day to day culture is very flexible. Peers are very supportive. "
good,"there is many type of work, many type of departments."
good,"Learned how to pacage and get along with people. Moved pallets to the FedEx,  packed pallets and cleaned the whole warehouse. Bsbshsjsjjsjsnsnnsnsnsnrhheheh."
good,"For young graduates. Great benefits, good hours. Team concept and numbers driven. You must have good computer skills. No breaks and, long hours especially during peak times"
good,"They work you like a dog and during the holidays you will have no free time. But if you're okay with selling your soul to Bezos for a couple months, then it's an alright job."
good,It was a fast paced job. I would go back.the staff were friendly and helpful. I am telling friends now to go through Amazon. I even order things from Amazon.
good,"The walk from your working stations are very far walk from when time of bell goes off to clock out & to the lunch room. Very limited time to purchase, warm food, and eat."
good,"its a great company, just some managers and employees should not work there, they have no professionalism. the pay is great, sometimes its hard  to move up if you dont suck up to the right people. but the company itself is a great company."
good,Started part-time as a temporary job. The biggest issue that most people would have would be the hours which is from midnight till the morning. You get training for the roles though most of the time you'll get put in a position that they deem you most efficient which could get a bit tedious. Still the work is physical which helps in keeping you awake. Enjoyed the company of coworkers and management were pretty nice in my experience and were always willing to help out new workers.
good,"As whiny as it sounds apparently I have to make a review but working at an Amazon Warehouse during Black Friday and Christmas was a difficult experience for me, mandatory overtime, constantly on your feet for 10 hours a day, and working overnight shift melted together wasn't fun."
good,"Great place to work as long as your managers see that you are exceeding productivity rates that they will change on a daily basis, all while trying to lower man hours so others have to work harder."
good,"Tempi di lavoro veloci e precisi, buona gestione del lavoro ma non buona organizzazione delle agenzie interinali"
good,"Whenever you work at Amazon, you work ten hour days for a minimum of forty hours per week. There's a morning shift and a night shift. You pick any four consecutive days of the week you wish to work. If you have both weekend days in your schedule, you get a fifty cent bonus. You also get a fifty cent bonus if you work night shift."
good,"ok as a stepping stone, but they don't see talented employees while they are working there. I had IT experience and just went and left and became network engineer with another company instead of working for amazon. i think outside of the box and could have been key network engineer for amazon, but hey your loss."
good,"face paced good benefits, hard labor on your feet for majority of the day so can get very tiring. enjoyed the management and being able to daily meet new people. As well enjoyed the benefits and incentives that would be given."
good,"great benefits, quick paced, friendly environment, on site injury care, very diverse, management sucks, no phones allowed, repetitive work, plenty of walking and excercise"
good,A typical day at Amazon is fast paced. I learned to quickly pull orders and manage my time. The hardest thing about working at amazon was standing. The most enjoyable part was the people.
good,Starting off it is a very nice place to work i loved it! but then i started to realize that there was a lot of favoritism taking place and workig here while pregnant is terrible but if you can make it the maternity leave is aamazing. Amazon gives you a set amount of PTO and UPT hours and thats all you get as time off there are no exceptions.
good,"Scanning the first item at a certain time is so darn stupid.   Even though your production is good, if you get 3 write ups within 90 days because of fast start you’re terminated.  The manager and human resource sucks.  The company will aggravate the he’ll out you about VTO when Xmas season is over.  They also care more about the items then the workers because no security going in, but only going out.  Anyone can walk in with some type of weapon and drugs.  What was the purpose of hiring permanent if you gonna turn around and let people go.  Hire fire hire fire hire fire is their motto. "
good,I only worked there for a week.  The company is a good company to work for but I changed to another company to work because of the hours. I would recommend it to another person.
good,"10 hours is a long time on your feet everyday, breaks are not long enough, lunch is not long enough, productivity is not easy to make every single week."
good,ok job nice benefits long work hours. Peak season is a nightmare. to many people too much taffic. Other than that it was cool. They just raised the pay so it will make it worth it now.
good,"they treat you as a robot, they don't give the the extra break that they have to give you when you work 10 hours, I just didn't like, because for them you just a number"
good,"Amazon warehouse associate treats you like a machine, not a person.  the most enjoyable part of the job is your co-workers they make it so much fun working there.  The warehouse is always and I mean always hot and sometimes you get those days where whoops sorry guys I put on the heater so you are literally baking in the warehouse."
good,"Targets not realistic."
good,"friendly associates, good pay, nice management, but unfortunately full time not available because of closing down my department, otherwise can earn good money, learn new activities not just picking or packing."
good,"Offers flexible schedules, and does overtime sometimes. The breakroom is large and has lots of snacks. The work is easy and not as bad compared to other warehouses."
good,nice relaxed place people are fun to be around at times can get hectic from time to time... depending on what area you are placed in.... you could be anywhere such as reciving unloading trucks placing packages on a conveyor line to stocking where the line loaders remove the items from your isle line and onto your cart for you to stock into the proper shelfs and scaned properly
good,I was a picker and you had to get to a area at a certain time or manager would come and explain your time off task.you had 1 30 mins. break the whole time there. some people talked a lot while working and when you had to get in the area they looked at you like you was interrupting their conversation.
good,"I would say it is a decent job for someone who is in need of work, but the environment could definitely be improved. The treatment of employees could also be improved."
good,If you are quality control you are lucky. Better than moving those boxes all day. Good first job but anything after that and you should work somewhere else. Little to no room for advancement.
good,"Working at Amazon was very grueling. While working, the associates had to stand the entire 10 hours of working while working on dealing with returns. All we did was work on the return boxes and figuring out if an item could be reused again or had to be thrown away. The environment is very loud because of the machines we were working on but pretty much employees were quiet during work. Amazon also had a minimum of boxes each employee had to reach every day. After training and working at the facility for a few weeks, after a month they want their new and current employees to achieve to do 10-12 boxes an hour which equals 100-120 boxes a day and equals 400-420 boxes a week for the four days employees work. I learned that returns are hard work, and if you get locations on where things need to go wrong, it reflects on everybody working in the other areas of the facility and not just yourself. I didn't get too much time to get to know my manager, while I was working at Amazon I mostly got help from people who were working at the facility longer than I had. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and earning good money."
good,"Fulfillment Associate. Amazon Fulfillment Associates are among those on the front line fulfilling customers' orders within the Fulfillment Centers. The ideal candidate is focused on the customer experience, quality, safety, and productivity."
good,Not for me. This job is good for people with no experience and ok with not making enough money for the hard physical labor that they require each employee to put in.
good,"keeps you on your toes, good place to work, good benefits, a team is friendly. nice work environment would recommend to someone whos looking to start off."
good,It's a ok job to have you it pays your bills and you have to be flexible but the people the run the business treat you like family. It's a job I can't really say anything bad about the job
good,"È richiesta molta molta precisione e velocità nello svolgere le proprie mansioni. Molto attento alla sicurezza sul lavoro. Tutto aommato l’ambiente è molto carino, acqua e devande sempre gratuite, area relax bene fornita e numerosi benefit per i dipendenti (di amazon, non delle agenzie!) 8 ore di lavoro con mezz’ora di pausa retribuita"
good,"Very stressful environment with ridiculous expectations. 10-12 hour shifts on your feet with huge gaps between breaks. Ridiculous goals to reach, not considerate."
good,On your feet for 10-12 hours. gotta keep up with a certain percentage or else you'll be fired. Managers were really cool. depending on your job you might have to walk alot
good,"it has been over 12 years since working as a temp, things can change over a period of time, this is not the review to use based on everday changes companies have"
good,"Good Job But They Could Use New Bosses & New Rates "
good,"Although this can be a fun place to work, you really need to be careful what you say to managers and HR. Every single person that I knew that went to HR had it turned around on them. They treat you like your a bad guy and like they are there to make it harder for you. I went to HR one time asking them if I could leave because my pregnant gf had to take our other child to the ER, they told me to tell her to get an uber.... They act like they get offended when you ask for help and then they go around and tell the managers if you complain about them, resulting in the managers screwing you over the next few weeks. Happened to me and plenty of others during my time there. You've been warned..."
good,c'est fatiguant mais bien payé et on peut évoluer.
good,"too much stress , workers are treated like machines , no great respect for individuals need. mandatory over time regardless of your family needs. no chance for advancement , you feel that it is a kind of jail cell, or military camp, who needs that????"
good,"The small time I spent at Amazon was somewhat overwhelming and felt like a High School environment to me as far as the employee's go. It's an easy job to do as long as you stick to your goals and try to make them or surpass them. Overtime is basically mandatory and as someone who just isn't a fan of late night shifts in general, it's pretty grueling to be a Picker from 6pm-6 or 7am."
good,"amazon was cool, I just didn't like the fast paced environment. I also didn't like that they made us work super hard and not pay enough. I also didn't like the management and the long hours"
good,"Repetitive Standing and manual labor in a warehouse setting.  Mostly a box factory with numbers and metrics to abide by..."
good,"Was always busy, rules were pretty harsh that you had to abide by. maintaining a perfect ""score"" in order to stay employed there. Some people didn't care to do the questionnaire at the end of the conversation."
good,This is a difficult place to be when you do not understand the structure of the company. Once you figure it out though it is quick to get used to and move foward.
good,"-Problem solving via phone, chat, email, or all 3."
good,"It was ok for temporary work, not to make a living. Management was horrible. They never showed up for work. Never there when you need them. A teenager would probably enjoy the pay rate, not a full grown adult."
good,"Long hours spent moving around on your feet with frequent required overtime. Good pay, benefits, and advancement opportunities. However I would not want to make it a full career."
good,"You will work hard, but it can be rewarding work!  The management is fair, but have allot on their plate and rely on supervisors for alot.  Peak can prove to be quite a challenge."
good,It a hard job to keep rate. It also a great job to work at. You get paid every Friday that what I like about the job.and one more thing I like working overnights.
good,i will run the line sometime i will also pack items in make sure they are ship off.i also did forklifting operating moving pilots uploading in unloading trucks
good,Good learning experience and amazing production team! We all learn everything new each day. Peers get along very well. Everyone on the production team helps out one another. Working and building these robots has taught me so much.
good,"Work suitable for young beginners with no physical limitation."
good,I love the Ping Pong table. It was  great table with both a ping and pong. Me and the co-workers would ping and pong on the table all day and we'd laugh and smile.
good,It was an okay exprience. It was a seasonal job so I couldn't really say much about it. There were times we were sent home early because the volume of the packages wasn't really enough for one shift.
good,"Bureaucracy happening too much. No work personal life balance."
good,"Great people to work with"
good,"Plan to work hard! Four 10 hour days, 3 days off are a nice blend. This is a transitioning position for me. Health benefits are worth the work - however, it's hard work and the pace is fast. You'll be busy here!"
good,the company itself is a great company to work for providing all types of avenues to get into. the only thing that gets in the way of such a good company is having the wrong management working.
good,"I would work there again if possible.  I enjoyed the ISS/problem solving aspect of the job.  It was a shame that they closed the Coffeyville, KS fulfillment center."
good,Amazon was a good paying job it just didn’t work with my schedule . I scabbed boxes & placed them where they belonged . Most of the time the boxes were heavy .
good,Amazon as a warehouse is a great place to see how it would be in any ordinary warehouse in the US. Its a great place to learn and possibly grow in an already booming online retail market (for some)
good,"Work was ok, but they train you and you learn so much but the test to confirm what you learn rarely happens and it feels like a waste. Also it was far"
good,I really liked my job at Amazon. i wish that there was room to grow with the the position i was in. I worked faithfully for 4 years. But i realized that it was time to move to a company the i could grow and make more money.
good,"Being a Warehouse Associate at Amazon is a fatiguing and laborious job.  Near mechanical in nature, it is not mind stimulating,"
good,"Very stressing environment, very poor coordination and long working hours and the pay is under the living wage. Job is not very secured, one could be fired anytime for no reason."
good,It's okay the people are friendly. the work is stressful they always want you to work work  work sometimes people get really tired because all they want you to do is rush and make sure you get the work done.
good,"just a warehouse job, but you must be willing to work hard and not be offended by being treated like a number. management is often young and inexperienced. policies often enforced inconsistently."
good,"i took a buy out and was told i could never work for amazon again"
good,"A workday at amazon would last about 10 hours with two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. I was trained in the customer returns department, processing and decanting, The workplace is very large and has a lot going on simultaneously. The hardest part about the job is that you're on your feet the whole shift and the short lunches. The most employable part of the job would be the benefits which include the discounts and stock options."
good,I would only recommend this job for young people or college students. I mean maybe for people that are just looking for extra in come. choosing this type of job from the bottom as a career not a good idea. Straight out of college working for corporate yeah!
good,Definitely will work a lot of hours on your feet with constant feedback on what can be done better.  Financial compensation for these requirements are fair.
good,Amazon is one of the greeters company I ever seen. It fun working there with excellent benefit over time and time of rolls. Amazon built me and teach me in so many amazing rolls I have never thought I could do...My only Problem about Amazon is how is how your time and experience you have been or hard in the company is not valued. You could be good train all kind of employees but at the end of the day they end up becoming a PA with a better pay than you.. Sometimes I feel like is about who you know in the company and I also feel like they a little Racist and have no growing plans for Africans and Caribbean's working there but rather other people of color being given the good roll and The Africans and Caribbean's left behind which is not fair..
good,overall good job. easy to get to easy towork for but some staff could be a bit better when comes to employess. sometimes there wasnt enough work so you would have extra time off which is alsway good when you have kids. not always the case as sometimes youask to stay on but they send you home anyway.
good,Amazon is a good place to learn technologies. Technologies and systems used are advanced. Gives scope for the employees to learn. Managers help employees.
good,"Woring at amazon was stressful. The things they say while telling you your job roles were almost completely different from what expected you to do. Working conditions were okay, but as an adult i shouldn't have to ask to go to the restroom."
good,".The job is easy, the hours are extremely flexible.  I have a work from home position.  The pay is terrible, no advancement opportunity, no benefits (at least for my position).  In my position, we cannot apply for promotions or internal job openings. We can only apply as an outside applicant.  The do provide a computer and headset at no cost to the employee."
good,"I was a contractor for a Security Company. The job was during Amazon peak season which requires Traffic Security. The overall job was to direct and monitor in coming and out going employees, contractors and visitors."
good,"A typical day working at amazon i would get there and we would have the group stretches before we start the shift. Then they would assign everyone to what job they would be fulfill that day. The managers were pretty nice and the work atmosphere seems pretty serious but the people are nice. Then you go on break for 15 minuets, and after that finish the rest of my five hour shift."
good,"a typical day at work is usually very fast-paced depending on your assigned job that day. The management is usually pretty good and takes into account any suggestions and request that you have during the job. Everything goes through a system so requesting time-off, or sick, or medical leave as well as schedule requests is usually a hit or miss. The work environment is pretty fast-paced and energetic. Would work there again because of the other employees."
good,"I will say that is a good company to work but their pay is what is not okay. Is a great warehouse company one can work but I will want them to increase the rate they pay their workers."
good,great place to aquire skills they just dont let you learn at a slower speed but getting in before peak season may help with that.  love the environment. really like the people I worked with.
good,"Working at Amazon is not rocket science, it's industry specific. Sorting, scanning, lifting, bending etc... while standing the entire time with the exception of lunch and break.  It's a warehouse setting, so it's dusty, cold or hot depending on the weather.  The employees are cool consisting of ordinary people either trying to get by or supplementing their income with a second job.  Management will remind you of a high school clique.  Actually, the whole working experience there will remind you of high school.   I feel like the company is fairly new and eventually they will learn from their mistakes and improve overall operations and conditions."
good,it was ok to work at first but it wasnt for me i wanted something a little different. to stand in 1 place all day looking at a computer screen was not for me i have to move around do different things everyday
good,I enjoyed the good environment.Workplace culture is great and Management is quite approachable.Learned to work under high pressure environment.It was a contract job.
good,"The company is very good for people that are looking to make quick cash but there is little room for growth. There are only a few advancement spaces as compared to the hundreds of people that are looking to advance,"
good,"Just a temporary job"
good,job is ok for a place to work at. the job pays good and also give good benefits. I would recommend this job for anyone who needs a job. This is not a bad job
good,"I need a position where advancement is based on productivity and hard work. I do like my job, but I no longer see it as a career path. I am looking for a better paying position for me and my family."
good,"Pack rates set by experienced workers who know the numbers needed right away and how to obtain them.  "
good,Amazon requires production at a fast pace there is a lot of heavy lifting and you must be accurate not to make mistakes. Always return back from your breaks on time or you can be terminated.
good,"They could do better at training, but overall the co-workers are helpful, supervisors were great also. More communication with management is needed. The hardest part of the job is the computer work with no real training guides. The position was very enjoyable but could pay a little better."
good,Amazon is an interesting place to work. How you like it depends on the department in which you work within. This will also control the number of hours you work.
good,days were long due to the lack of the management very poor and messy from last shifts. which caused stressed days and mad bosses towards regular employees.
good,"have to be prepared for a fast start, its required to meet rate or you recieve write ups, management just gives out orders."
good,"Working at Amazon can be the best time of your life or the worst time of your life, all depending on what department you work in and what the current management is like."
good,I have seen very poor experiences and very positive experiences.  It all depends on your manager.  The overall culture is good because it self-cleans out anyone who should not be with the company.
good,"Good job to have for a time, but you'll consume a lot of energy just try to keep up with everybody else so you don't get fired. But it is good daily excise."
good,"they work you in those under supported and very poorly kept warehouses that look great on the outside but are beyond hot and nasty inside and if they dont have work for you to do they take product off the shelves to make work so they keep you busy, couldnt find my manager to save my life and the pay is not enough"
good,Les prolongations de contrats sont proposées et les évolutions possible. Bonne entreprise. Les employés ont un statut similaire et la culture y est très importante. Salle de pause remplie de divertissements.
good,It a company to learn how the warehouse operate and also learn how to use certain pit machine. You will meet great people and you can gain knowledge of leadership and management skills.
good,"a lot of work, nice cool in they have a/c."
good,"I know you may have heard this before, but at Amazon it is more true than anywhere else. Your badge is a number, your employee ID is a number, your managers know you by your Login before they know you by your name. The rate steadily increases, they count the time it takes to walk to the break room as part of your break time (15 minute break, 5 minute commute = 10 minute break). Lunch is just 30 minutes out of a 10 hour shift which is unpaid. It doesn't matter if you have given them 2 years of hard labor, always making rate, being a leader and showing them how much you care. If you have one bad week at work rate wise, you will get a documented verbal and possibly a write up that same week. So 104 Weeks of good work, then 1 week of you not performing to their expectations, you get written up."
good,its always something fun to do its not a bad job at all and the pay is decent its fast pace and everyone is nice the training was paid and so was orientation
good,"Non importa l'impegno, indipendentemente dalla mansione assegnata. Le selezioni restano un mistero così com'è arcana l'organizzazione del lavoro. Cercano automi non persone, per quanto tentino con futili eventi di mascherare il tutto"
good,"Fast paced incoming call center concurrently working calls, chats and emails. Multiple chances to change departments for change of pace, but usually a lateral move for compensation"
good,"Good hours, good job, poor management. Great place to work if you like to do “hands on work” or if you like to stay away from customers face to face. Overall it’s okay"
good,"It was a nice place to work, many advancement opportunities, fun people to work with and great enviremnent**************************************************"
good,I feel like this place could be amazing. but they care more for their customers then there staff. yes the staff gets great things in the break room and lots of free coffee and other things. but we give the customer the benefit of the doubt why not your employees. its almost like they do not care if they have to hire 500 new people every season. you would think they would look in to keeping the ones they already trained. its very stressful to be yelled at on the phones from the customers. its very emotionally draining
good,"I worked for Amazon twice. The first experience was not very good at all. The recruiting leadership didn't ever have any real direction, at the same time coming in as a contractor, it never felt that welcoming. My second time, my manager was one of the best I've had, however some of the clients we supported would make some ridiculous demands at times. Primarily with the type of candidate they wanted us to find, along with an unrealistic timeline."
good,I have no review at this time. I don't have much to say about this company and their ways of work. The management was not the best. They all had their on people.
good,Under payed salary and highly stressful. Unreasonable expectations by management because it's impossible to exceed all customer expectations. This impacts your salary negatively
good,fast paced work environment. during peak you have lots of overtime and after peak you are lucky to get 30 hours a week. the hardest part of the job is the walking 10 miles a day but it was a work out
good,"I was told that the Petersburg/ Dinwiddie, VA location has heavier cases than the Chester, VA location. During peak season, there wasn't that much space to stow products away and the managers just brushed it off because it wasn't anything that they could do. The employees should have gotten paid more than $10-10.50 a hour."
good,"Very long days.  Be prepared to be on your feet the whole time.  Breaks are nice and short.  They do have structure there.  It was nice to receive overtime, but it just got draining."
good,Amazon is a pretty good company to work for. They take pretty good care of you. They pay pretty well. It is hot in the building. Management is pretty standard.
good,Good and fun place to work met a lot of good people from there needs slightly more management but all round not a bad place to work ..................
good,"Great learning opportunity with India Teams as they are growing."
good,Overall decent place to work. I was a 150% picker but was let go due to a a late arrival caused by an accident on my way to work. They have a zero tolerance attendance policy.
good,It hurt standing for 10 hours a day at first. The pay was good. I worked seasonal got a leadership award and was invited to come back but they didn't even have most of us work the 60 days they promised let alone hire us on full time. A lot of people left their jobs to work for them and then ended up having no job.
good,"It was a part time job, and I was trying to get all my hours everyday I was working. Really frustrating for the management looking for VTO (volunteer time off) every night."
good,"i wasn't there too long. but the time i was there, it wasn't too bad. they worked your butt for sure. not the worst. not the best. i wouldnt do it again"
good,"Always clean ,respectful employees and managers.the breaks you get 2 15 min beaks and a 30 min lunch but the building is so big so it takes about 5mins to get from your station to the break room and 5 mins to get back. every thing is fast paced you have to keep up with The required rates"
good,its just work. there not willing to let you do anything different. i want to move up but they seem to treat associates like children. If i have the opportunity to go up i will
good,"Good multicultural work environment, fast pace really strict. you have to maintain a certain   bmp. i really feel like lunch wasnt long enough. if you have to use the restroom, you have a 5 min walk across a 1.4million sq ft. building and you have to be back within 2min."
good,"I have to say that Amazon is a place of opportunity, it has awesome benefits, most managers are fair and have a good judgement towards every employee, the job culture is mostly motivating depending of the team you are in. "
good,Anyone with a little bit of job experience and can perform a drug test can get a job at Amazon. There is no formal interview and the people there are very nice and laid back.
good,It's ok to work there if it's not for a long time. Or if it's your career but if it's not forever type of thing it won't be for you. More than likely the people that don't like to work are the one that make the working place impossible and cut-throat.
good,"10 hr work day 40 hr work week "
good,great benefits...Just a large warehouse need longer lunch considering the size of the facility.  The training could be a lot better.  I teammate the are leading can use more training
good,They give you good benefits to keep you there. But depending on where you live the pay could suck. Like the Charlotte area is like $11.50 an hour. They need more break times.
good,"Great place, so long as you do your job and do it well, you will have the opportunity for advancement. I’ve been working there for less that a year but have moved up to Ambassador and will be in line for a promotion before the end of the year."
good,It's a good place to work at just sometimes it can be over welcoming as to what job you have. The commute was fine and the people that I have worked with have been good.
good,I think if Amazon get a cafeteria and take down the prices on the vending machine and it will be okay and if the managers would acknowledge your work every now and again.
good,its  a good work environment wish there was more hours offered then what are. there are manager friendly people there some a little favoritism to others.. over all its on a good pace and organized
good,"A typical day at work, I would come in through security, scan in my badge and meet my team at a certain location to perform stretches. After stretches, there was a board with a list of our names telling us which station we would be at for the day. At our stations we would begin order picking by pressing on our screens to start so that the robots would begin coming to our station and products would appear on screen of what to grab and how many to grab. Typically, you had 7 seconds to grab each item to meet the companies standard quota. Management would always be on top of you to make sure you werent having any trouble meeting their expectation. The environment is fast paced, competitive and quiet for the most part aside from the machines making noises. Overall it was a cool place to work and keep to yourself."
good,"fast paced environment"
good,"Very stressful job, did not agree they way employees are treated, once you are employ for more then 6 months for holidays you only get pay for 4 hours not a full 8 hours.."
good,Typical Day consisted of managing 50 to 60 inbound dock associates unloading the total of about 35 to 50 trailers a day making sure my team was efficient and safe doing they daily job assignments and duties.
good,"I loved this job until things took a turn for the worst. This company is all about quality and picking speed. If your fast with your hands and tall this place will be great for you. Everyone here was super friendly and I got along with everyone. Gossiping in this place is a big no no. If your picking rate speed is not over 150 than your considered slow and you will get talked to by a manager on a plan to pick up your picking speed. Depending if you work day or night will determine and impact your picking rate. Now I worked nights which meant I had no inbound associates around to stock the shelves us outbound associates pick from. The thing you have to remember is your working in different temperatures ranging from room temperature to below zero degrees, Now depending on which manager on duty you get depends on how long your gonna be in the freezer if you do get put on freezer. My biggest problem was this company is that people with disabilities are expected to be treated on the same level as other associates and expectations are the same. It seemed weird to me especially when they ask if you have a disability that you'd expect them to accommodate with you but no. I've had people with disabilities come in and quit. I loved my job but it put a lot of stress on me to the point my health was declining. I ended up quitting. At first it's tough but once you find what selection your good at you'll love it and make sure to voice yourself on what you know your good at depending on picking rate. Call your manager on duty ahead of time if your sick because this will affect the points you"
good,"Pros"
good,"I’ve been working here 3 years"
good,managers are ok system is not ok work is hard and long 4 days a week plus overtime every week will not work for this company ever again im sorry amazon you suck g's up hoes down
good,It was a good job to have i just didn't see it being a permanent job for me I don't like the long hours though and it was a very stressful job for me.
good,This job is like clock work. Its the same thing everyday. You have to work fast steady and be consistent. Management stays on you at all times to make rate and get those packages out on time.
good,You must keep moving and meet your quota or you will be terminated. You rarely see management and the supervisors play politics alot. It is all about who you know in order to move up.
good,"Lacks in employee satisfaction and long hours, Job work/life balance is not that great."
good,I really liked the hours that I worked at amazon and the people that I worked with were really fun to be around. It was a relaxing atmosphere and there was training if you needed a boost in your performance. Managers were always available to ask questions and help you through what ever problems you faced.
good,The warehouse was organised. Every staff met was friendly and approachable. Hours were quite long however two breaks ensured energy was revitalised during each shift. The pay was fair and bonuses were offered for hard-work and overtime.
good,"The job I had was a fun place to work at but it was very low income for me , i was getting paid very much to do the things I had to get done I have 2 kids that are depending on me , I need help"
good,Amazon has great benefits and you learn about driving different fork lifts safely but the manage was terrible. No ethics and they really stress that the turnover rate is high so getting rid of people is ok and that's a direct quote from a member of the management team.
good,Great benefits. Some managers are lazy and some go on a power trip. Very strict with time. When coming back in a clocked in on time but wasn’t in my work area on time. Was late by 10secs and it became a huge problem
good,"Management is poor, they rush you through training and when it’s time to answer phone calls you feel very unprepared. They do offer lots of breaks though."
good,"It was great back then. Still felt like a startup with only the Retail site as the focus. We innovated on a daily basis, and the atmosphere was collaborative and fun."
good,The experience was new something different than the line of work i was used to doing on daily basis. Lots of hard work the job was very physical. Must be available for all shifts.
good,"Amazon is a cool company, thriving and exciting to work there, and nice compensation, but management is all white male with very little diversity.  It's difficult for women and minorities to move up in the company since people tend to hire and promote the same types of people repeatedly.  Amazon doesn't seem to care about this at all."
good,"This company provides great compensation and asks for long hours in return. The work is exciting, but the work/life balance isn't always the best. Overall a good experience and great for challenging yourself and learning new skills."
good,"Not bad place to work at all. Long as you work hard, focus, concentrate and hit your targets then nothing is problem. Providing you keep yourself to yourself this not a bad place to work. Some managers ain’t got clue when it comes down to man management. Can be pressurising environment but if challenged in the right manner and work along side colleagues everything can be smooth. Not as bad the media make out to be. Support is always there just accessing it."
good,It's a great company to work for but quickly changing to become an environment of you being a number among many. You have to be very careful with your time.
good,It wasn’t to bad. I began to have problems with my door that prevented me from standing from r so long. Amazon have many perks to working there. Random free things and great benfits
good,Amazon is an okay job to work at if you want a job immediately and to get paid immediately. Make friends there if you want your time there to be more pleasant. it's very easy to not see anybody for hours there.
good,Working at amazon taught be great team building skills. I had to think fast and always be on my toes as a team leader. It was great working alongside a great team and progressing forward
good,"the work is stressful and fast paced, the pay needs to be increased. some of the scanning machines dont work properly."
good,Enjoyable if you like a fast paced environment. Great people. Great Managers. Always room for improvement & there is always something there for you to do
good,It helps but I think they can do better with hours. It's also hard to advance because of some obvious favorites. You have to literally BUST your a** to even have your efforts being NOTICED. It has it's pros and cons but it's not the worst and if you put the time in you do make money.
good,ok place to work  i worked in icqa it was pretty easy work counting product in the  bins and keeping up with the inventory in the plant who knew my small job made a big impact in the building
good,management not very good and every day is customer focus day with targets to reach for each department. You do learn a lot about the company with lots of different cultures of people working there
good,it is a very fast pace job they will want you to go super fast to get the orders out what I learn from this job is they are very hard and by the book.
good,"non stop"
good,"This job is great for someone that always wants to be on the move (10+ miles in a single shift), to have as much work and overtime as possible, and to have autonomy as long as you are making your rates. Management is inexperienced and many write-ups are handed out based on misunderstandings or miscommunications. You are a robot, but you will never run out of work and OT is usually available."
good,"Amazon certainly gives you the total autonomy one needs to grow and made impactful decisions. However, this is where it gets tricky. In the group I'm in, metrics rule the world. Its difficult to acquire metrics around a project or process that you've created. They hold you to it as well. So be prepared to live and die by any sword you forge."
good,The location I worked at had a good work culture and atmosphere when the management was playing favoritism. I do like the work shifts its fast and my coworkers were fun to work with.
good,"This wasn't a bad job but it's definitely not an easy one. As long as you  get cross-trained this job can be very repetitive. Christmas time is rough, save up your vacation time!"
good,I liked the people I worked with....I felt there was no advancement for me....the people there were very nice...the 10 hour day was broken up very well with a break in the morning ...a lunch ...and a break in the afternoon
good,Very fun and productive workplace. A lot of incentives. This is a very fast paced environment. The best part of the job was the laid back dress code. The hardest part was being on your feet so long.
good,"The learning curve was limited at amazon warehouse, while more stress was given on productivity in terms of speed at which a task is to be performed."
good,"work was steady at times. But during the Thanksgiving season, things really picked up. The package flow increased tremendously. So much so we barely kept up w processing to the pallets to be delivered."
good,"We had work as soon as we came into the building. We had 3 breaks including a lunch break. It was sometime stressful when we had a lot of problems, but other than that it was a good working environment."
good,A typical day for me was driving around an Order Picker counting product.  There are a lot of people in the center which can cause some chaos.  Isle's were limited space and were constantly blocked by another employee.  I saw the picker side who were always asked to reach impossible goals in quantity of items picked within a certain time.  A lot of time numbers couldn't be made to the other employees impeding your production.
good,"everything you could want to buy, and evrything u could want to do in a ware house the staff are all great people. the hiring process was very informational."
good,it is a busy company to work for and the pay is good and you get trained up in alll areas of the warehouse and there is free tea and coffee on site and ample parking
good,I was a good company to work for. A lot of hours and the over time was good at the time. Can become very stressful at times with all of the over time..
good,"Mostly fast-paced but low pay. Great benefits tho and some of management actually does care and try to assist their workers. Some "
good,"A typical day at work consisted in having new experiences with products everyday, I learned to give the best of me and enjoy working in that environment."
good,"Production rate is what matters most. Must pack 88 or higher for production as a packer, you have about a month to make rate. During peak things get nutty because trainers do not train employees properly prior to peak. There is a lot to know before peak hits. Peak is usually July and November to January. You are allowed 3 written warnings until terminated. Drug testing is random. It is a mouth swab test, yes they test on site. Money is good but working peak you will work 50-60 hrs a week. Definitely fast paced environment. Not everyone is crossed trained. Everything is monitored closely. There is A LOT of cherry picking!"
good,Expect 12-14 Hour work days...nonstop. Challenges in work/life balance are real. Balance out the unrealistic expectations. Some work well in teams. Others do not
good,"Only there during peak; it was very fast paced and at times it was difficult to keep up. Mandatory overtime could get stressful, but the pay helped.out a lot."
good,Its a good job if u need money. The warehouse is modern and up to date so it’s a cool place to be employed. It is hard work and you will be tired at the end of your shift.
good,"I worked at the fulfillment center, and it was a great experience. Working in the outbound department, I had very friendly and understanding team members, leaders, and management. The ten-hour work days can be taxing. The position I was in required me to work quickly and correctly- basically they track your speed and quality; meaning you had to be highly self motivated and work was very fast paced. It was a warehouse, so expectations must be kept in check, but some days the ten-hour shifts could become very grueling and monotonous."
good,You will get to do more at amazon than elsewhere. As a junior engineer you will have a lot of responsibility and the pace is demanding. The flaw I found was that team culture shifted and it became very hard for me to work there anymore.
good,This job atmosphere is a place where one can think about what is next in their journey. it is invigorating as well as inspiring.  this environment is fast pace and they expect productivity.  working with people it is more about quality and handling one with honor and respect.
good,Why the would I care. stop making me do this. Anyways Amazon is not that bad but it could pay more and be more organized I give a 5 out 10 for places to work.
good,"bonne ambiance, tres belle experience rien a signaler"
good,Okay job. Work is easy. Could be easier to pick up shifts. Pay is okay. Sometimes the work can be strenuous but otherwise simple and straightforward. Would do job again.
good,Job consists of answering phone calls and emails to the sellers on Amazon. Sellers will scream at you because Amazon favors their buyers and not their sellers. Kind of frustrating as you cannot fix most of the seller's problems and they will blame you.
good,Job was ok no real problems working there except for the constant jamming of the conveyor belts the working environment was fun the managers do preshift meetings to set goals for the day
good,"Good work, quite a good salary, social conditions as far as ok. Unfortunately, not the best organization of work, quite a turnover of employees. The practitioners were unpleasant. low-level leadership is to be unprepared, unpredictable and chaotic."
good,when at work make sure your on time even going to lunch. I've learned to have fast paced  skills. Staff/management is really fun but also professional also they have really good benefits
good,"Peak season (60 hours) is not so bad if you can tolerate standing for 9 1/2 hours. After peak the work flow begins to decrease, slowly but surely (50 hours). A warehouse with two libraries on opposite ends of the facility basically. Multiple floor levels, and large spaces outside of libraries. Helpful positive employers, motivated employees. (O2016-F2017)"
good,"It was alright. Stressful and very hard at times but overall was a decent place to work, long hours but the pay was fair for the work that needed doing."
good,Empresa dinâmica e agradável de traballhar e o trabalho em equipe é valorizado.
good,"cool people, bad environment. if you're just looking for a check, this is the job for you. there is opportunity to move up fairly quickly though. People that I started with moved up to managers in less than a year."
good,Most workmates are really super people.  It was great to be able to assist so many people and it was especially fun and rewarding to be to work on top secret digital product and to test as well.
good,"The job was, the management was good. You could work from home. No interview required. Just pass a test and you were hired. it was great I would work there again."
good,"Good for Freshers.If you want to be a smart within the time constraint,think big,Dive Deep,Have end to end ownership,learn a lot of stuff apart from coding and get exited about the designs and Architecture Amazon is right place.Not at all recommended for the ones who want to have a worklife balance.Here it is not about the amount of work but the productive work,smart designes,how to avoid repeating the mistakes ,what systems can you design to avoid/figure out what went wrong in the system etc."
good,the job was nice a lot of exercise like the streatches we do at the start of each break and love the folks as well will help in an hurry nice break room and climate
good,They expect you to run the machines and not take a break and if you take a break they want to know where you where going. They wanted you to produce 100% everyday.
good,"I would not say everyones' critic is the same since they have so many teams, and each is different, mine, however, wasn't that collaborative and even suggests no questions asked for an on-boarding intern, along providing minimum information and caused huge stress. I would not speak too highly of my team as I feel I am a more collaborative person and value the power of discussion, idea exchanging rather than staring at the screen trying to learn everything in the whole world by myself to get the work done."
good,"If you’re looking for something short term, amazon is great. Chances of advancement are slim without 4 year college degree. Best part of the job are the people."
good,"Decent warehouse job moving packages."
good,"Overall , I feel they are very unprofessional. They lie to you to get you there & once they get you there then they tell you that they misled you. The managers are very much unprofessional also."
good,"All about business,work no play,phones are not allowed on the floor what i learned is how to keep a mind set goal management is firm and all about business work place culture is divers hard part of the job id walking back and forth on the cement floors and trying to manage your when the bins are stocked or over stocked to the limit the most enjoyable part of the job is the meeting of different co-workers."
good,"I didn't like the heat, breaks, managers, and work environment.  It was very stressful place to work.  So high school like .  Would not recommend anyone working there."
good,not bad pay considering the work is not that hard. the only issue I really had was the favoritism. if you're not a suck up or kissing the manager's butts life can get hard there. had issues with employees dating or seeing managers there. the employees who did generally had an easy life there. favoritism tops seniority there. they'll do nice things for the employees here and there. like there will be free meals like on Christmas and Thanksgiving.
good,"job would never be secure with Amazon"
good,Amazon is not a great place to work. This place sucks. There is no room for growth or advance mental. They are slave drivers and they treat thier employees like they are just a number
good,"scanned packages, palletized, load trucks. get packages ready for shipment. Assorted packages into conveyor for packers to scanned into the there proper location."
good,"I’ve had good experiences with Amazon until I was Injuried .I feel as if they push us to work hard as the robots they use .Its very competeive ,a lot of repetition and hard work ."
good,"Every year they demand more out of you than the previouse year, and without out a real raise. They start you at $13.50 and give you a 50 cent raise every six months untill you cap out at $15.50. That's entry level. If you get premoted, which the ratio from associate to lead is like 50+ to 1, so not to likely, you start at $16 and cap at $18.35. It's a good starter job if you just out of High School and are going to College. They are flexible to your school schedual and pay for most certificates and degrees up to $3000 a year for up to 4 years for you."
good,"Nice place to star For someone who starts a new job "
good,"Easy way to get quick money. Managers and staff work fairly and treat with respect. The pay rate is just ""ok"", unless you worked in different positions."
good,Brak zastrzeżeń. Praca lekka atmosfera ok pieniądze ok
good,"at my time at amazon i spent most of my shifts from 12pm all the way to 10am , the management and my colleagues were very polite. the most enjoyable part of the job was that i was allowed to joke around with my friends whilst i worked."
good,"personne sympa et gentille"
good,Amazon offers productive workstation setup and entertainment area for employees. Cafeterias are located in most of the buildings. The campus is located in SLU it's very easy to commute between buildings.
good,"Very challenging work considering its physical effort and tolerance working most especially at chilled and the freezer.  "
good,"As an associate at Amazon, you have very strict rules that you have to comply with. Starting from high targets to being late for work, or long toilet breaks. "
good,Wenn in der nähe wohnt bzw in Leipzig ist es Perfekt
good,Management team could be more considerate of associates.The job environment is good the people you meet are awesome however job advancement could be better.
good,"Fast paced working environment with little outside help , very independent workplace , high focus and patience are key , will work there again in future"
good,"Travail d'usine, répétitif et peu enrichissant. "
good,"I had a great time in training, learning new skills with the managers, and in the gift wrapping area at Christmas. The people were always nice and usually accommodating."
good,"In Amazon, you have the incredibly hard workers and the workers that get away with doing close to nothing. Management cannot push or coach an associate to hard or there will usually be an HR complaint. The harder workers feel unmotivated as their tasks are to do that of a Process Assistant(PA) but are being paid $14 to feel pressured by management to do more and be more with no promise or real push for promotion."
good,Was a great place to work but if you don't meet the daily requirements of your productivity you're out of there. Would not recommend it to anyone just wanting a job need to be young fit and everything.
good,"Great place to work for quick money"
good,"Amazon is a fast-paced work environment with achievable daily quotas. It will get quite busy during peak season with mandatory overtime, but the paycheck will make it worth your while."
good,"Work hard make history, I work as a virtual shopper, i like it very much. I work as a virtual shopper , i am a problem solver , ambassador, it is a great way to make extra money ."
good,"Mixed review in my experience, work is fairly straightforward. I go to work and give max effort, but that is not enough at Amazon, and I am not interested in politics or high school drama."
good,Half the time work was good it all depended on who you were working with and what area you were working in other than that half the management were amazing the othere half were the type you would see in a bar after they have had 6 or 7 pints flirting with everyone who walked into the room i am going back to the end of last year for this and the agency are a bunch of scum who lie about everything they say and do like i would still b working there now if they didnt lie about the coach between them and the amazon management terrible but other than that. I cant complain about targets as i always hit them as you only really need to hit targets half the day for the 4 days that you work and it will average out over the week as a good point. Another thing if you wanna work here make friends with a waterspider as if they see you struggling they will bring you a good box for you to scan mostly full of phone cases maybe 3000 plus in the box
good,This is good job for college students on breaks. You wouldn’t want to work here year round. You’ll get tired of doing the same thing everyday. It’s going to get boring.
good,"They put to much pressure on their employees to work at unreasonable pace. If you cant make rate they fire you even if you can make it in anther area! This is what is hurting them the most, their blatant inability to place employees in their places of strength. Insted they insist on firing good employees that could excel in different areas in their business if given the opportunity."
good,"Working at Amazon is like a rollercoaster,you never know when change will come and if you haven't heard of the new change you still receive a verbal coaching,That becomes very annoying....Through out the plant management is terrible are unprofessional,  you speak your mind your now on the copping block and they scam together to hit you with the Time off Task,Ten hours a Day how is it possible to be out of task for more the3-4 hrs???? I also dislike the fact that they have employees telling on each other and will address the employee concerning the matter regardless if it a lie....Amazon is a good paying job and you get through the day the best way you can in order to feed and take care of your family.There No Love in these places( you may meet a few and thats rear)....Good Luck to all whom is employed at Amazon!!!"
good,"Turn over rate is high for a reason. They offer a buyout for employees that make it to five years but upon taking the buyout, that individual cannot work for any Amazon owned busuness again. This job does not make for a good retirement plan."
good,fairly good place to work though a little out off the way ideal for someone who can drive. high pressured environment quite stressful person must be fast
good,"Working there was fine. I have no true feeling towards working at Amazon. It was work , I had no feelings towards it because I was a warehouse associate."
good,"good job but quite demanding. very respectful co workers and management which makes life so much easier and also a fantastic cafeteria with great food, kind prices and a pool table"
good,"If you are lucky and get a good manager, you can be very satisfied with the job. However, if you are unlucky, your boss also can be very mean to you. Very unfortunately I had a bad boss who got tons of bad feedback from all the team. 5 of her staffs quit because they couldn't stand her. Even so she is still working for Amazon for the 6th year. No one is going to deal with a mean-boss-situation."
good,"-It was good pay,"
good,"Can be very stressful. Management rely on rates and quality. Three strikes your out. Big turnover within this company. Communication between management and associates, all associates not only the special few, is not good."
good,Great place for those looking at a first or second job. Mainky suited towards a younger subset of employees. At least in the facikity i was at most employees were in their 20s.
good,no excuses for human error you always have to be faster than the 5 people around you to stay in good standing favoritism is very common hr is no help when needed
good,I really enjoyed my manager and coworkers they were like family to me :) having 3 days off in a row was my favorite part of the job. They had fun days were you could wear crazy socks too
good,Varied tasks on a daily basis as well as varying shift patterns allowing for a good work life balance. Monitoring all aspects of the building and staff.
good,Amazon work is easy but the hours are very long. The salary is fair though for the work that you are required to do. Paid time off and unpaid time off is very lenient.
good,"While the benefits package is stupendous, the environment is laking. The focus is suppose to be customer obsessed, but you're on a time restraint. Most associates miss things, but ICQA is there catch those missed. The overall experience is that of stress and not well communicated changes."
good,"The good: Amazon is a place you go to for stretching yourself beyond limits you didn't know were possible. I believe it was career boot camp for me, in a truly good way. I can do what I did in my previous roles in my sleep after seeing it all at play in Amazon. I learned so much about myself and what high standards, delivery of results and bias for action really mean- And moreover, how important they are. They compensated VERY well, and the RSU portion is amazing if you can make it past 2 years (it worked out very well for me). The people, are smart and ambitions. I learned something new from everyone there. "
good,"Long, stressful, fast-paced job. I enjoyed working at Amazon. It was a very competitive company, I especially liked their pto and upt system. earn time off as you work is a great incentative."
good,"although it is quick paced, it is a great placed to work. The environment keeps you on your toes and the pay is great for the labor work required for most of the positions."
good,"Fun fast paced environment, Long hours (10-12) depending on shift with 2 30 minute breaks, lots of standing and constantly on the move. Not a bad place to work, would recommend night shifts."
good,I enjoyed working here. The people made it fun. But at times it felt like we were sold dreams by our management just so we can work harder. Money and benefits were great .
good,"Load containers with assigned packaging for delivery vans to pick and carry out next morning. "
good,"I like all the benefits that they have to offer, we get snacks and drinks for free. They also allowed to eat snacks during work as long as it was quick."
good,It was a good job to make money as overtime was really well paid. There was a good development program but sometimes the feeling was that there was no equal treatment regarding promotion opportunities. There was a great variety of tasks to perform depending on which department one worked.
good,Go to work and get paid there pay scale is low for the amount of income Amazon is actually being made you can't bring your cellphone through the Gates and there is plenty of managers on the floor
good,"It wont let me skip, but if I had to say it was OK place to work but you wont be able to support yourself off of this job alone.  Pay was $15.50 starting for my batch and it they care a lot about their scan rate which I didn't like.  I left because shortly after starting I injured my arm and decided it was better for me to look for a different job."
good,"Working at amazon with the right managers can be fun but still very tiring. with managers changing so often, its hard to keep relationships up with them. They can write you up for seemingly whatever they want and getting a promotion is very hard unless your managers love you."
good,a typical day at work is go there get the job done then leave that's all that there is to it I picked I packed I stowed and I received that's all my job was
good,"great benefits, pto, vacation . you gotta meet production and make sure you can stand for long periods of time. you can move up but you gotta know the right people"
good,"Make sure one has the ability to work individually and understand the tasks at hand, managers are always willing to answer questions. Scheduling is very flexible and done by the employee theirself!"
good,A typical day at work was walking from bin to bin to stow away merchandise received for customers to see online for purchase. Also may have to retrieve the item for shipment to the customer.
good,"the hardest part of this job, there are too much of task to be done without no tools for this but what I learned about this job .have learn to be more protective."
good,Work was very hared on peoples feet that is what caused me to quit. hours were long to be on your feet in and all concrete facility. to offer shoes with insoles would be great.
good,Amazon is a difficult company to work for. I did well but I saw many individuals leave Amazon within the fist few months of being hired. People who want to work at Amazon must understand that Amazon's work environment is different than anything they've ever encountered.
good,It’s an alright job but nothing major in my eyes I guess...know you gotta work hard and stay on time and dedicated to your work and then the time flies by.
good,Unable to progress without a degree. The whole internal promotion is unfairly beneficial to those with a degree. Most enjoyable part of the job is the focus on engagement.
good,Overall good company. Just was a bit unorganized wasn't suggested to others feelings on how they felt as far as the learning process.  It was either get it in 2 wks or get gone!!
good,"Working in operations consists of long days, shifts were typically 12 hours long. Learned a lot about analytics and how to make data driven decisions."
good,it was an ok place to work. they handled the workers well you get two breaks in the day. each of them being a half hour. the only problem its the security is so tight they end up being like 20 min breaks.
good,wonderful. I worked full time through a temp service. I was to be hired by amazon within 3 months. I was there 6 months and not offered anything. Another career came up and I decided to leave Amazon to persue altenative career.
good,"co-workers were nice, free lunch once a week. Meetings once a week. Easy to access information online and online training were fun and interactive. The website used for work to access to benefits were user friendly. Working conditions were harsh, schedules were tight and there is no work life balance."
good,"Fast-paced, hard working warehouse workplace/life.  I gave my all which was NOT enough.  I gave over 100% but Amazon/Integrity demanded 200%.  Good news, I got paid every week via (my option) a pay card.  I didn't have to stand in a bank line to get paid.  Whoa!!"
good,"Fast paced work place/life.  Not for me in the warehouse setting.  I would like, however, to be able to work @ home for Amazon.  It has good points as well as bad points...stock options, by- weekly pay BUT if you are hired through a Temp Agency, you get paid weekly.  It is strenuous work but there are bodies there that can give 200% and stay on task.  #warehouse life."
good,"No other job would push you like Amazon. In my experience, it tough but fair. If you can survived here, you'll be able to survive 90% of anything else."
good,It wasn't a terrible place to work it was just not what I thought it would be and it was too far from where I live. The people were great and very helpful.
good,On your feet for 10+ hours a day but it is a warehouse after all. Management is mainly fresh out of college kids with little to no experience. the workplace can be fun and stressful at the same time. hardest part about the job for some people is keeping up with the rates they hold you to.  The pay is relatively low for a warehouse and the amount of work they expect you to do.You do however get stocks that vest after 2 years of employment. Overall a great starter job but unless your fresh out of college its extremely hard to move into management.
good,"There were many opportunities within my department to learn new indirect roles. However I do not feel I was given fair chance to advance and move up within the company, despite all my strengths"
good,"Advertising has extremely smart people, however the political environment and bad PMs, drive engineers out. Constant reorgs and lack of visibility from senior management."
good,"A typical day at work when working for Amazon was very quick pasted and a lot of heavy lifting. Also, very long hours with not enough break time. Sometimes we were so busy we would not be able to take a break at all. In addition, the hardest part of the job was the long hours every single day and the heavy lifting."
good,"L'ambiente è frenetico, attivo, talvolta stressante, ma piacevole nel complesso. Le mansioni sono molte, e nella loro semplicità fanno girare il grande ingranaggio che è la logistica che si nasconde dietro a un clic. La pausa è breve, basterebbero un 10 minuti in più per poterla davvero definire tale. Ma dopo sole 7 ore di ""passo Amazon"" a prelevare prodotti, forse è chiedere troppo. Piuttosto non retribuirli caro Jeff, almeno non mi ritrovo a 40 anni con le gambe di una mummia xD"
good,"Lack of long term investment in level one associates was a bit disturbing to see. Attrition rate was higher than I anticipated.  Level one employees are the backbone of this organization. Objective of any organization is to make money, however it should be a balance between profits and care for employees.  Upper level management was poor at best.  Seems they only stick around long enough for stock to vest."
good,"Very competitive and fast paced environment. working in a warehouse lifting heavy boxes 5 hrs straight one 30 min break, paid weekly it was an ok job."
good,"A typical day working at Amazon including arriving bright and early, and mental prep for an extensive work shift. The breaks weren't very long and sometimes there would be mandatory overtime. Employees were expected to work fast and precise. Pay was good."
good,Never knowing how long my work day is going to be or how many hours I am going to be paid for my time away from my family. I learned how to give my time freely and working harder to do that. My management team is unpredicitible and hard to talk to. My workplace is uncomfortable by never knowing what each manager expects. The hardest part of the job is being put in situations where my safety was questionable. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and being able to help them when given the opportunity.
good,"10 hour shifts"
good,"The work at Amazon is quite challenging and has daily targets. Ideal organization for someone who is up to the task of working long hours. Workplace culture is relaxed though. They have various pass-time activities. However, the real challenge is to maintain focus on work even after these activities since the deadlines are very tight."
good,"good job, great leaders, okay staff, short lunches, short breaks, rushed back to work after breaks, strict on time, rush, strict on time off, stick to yourself"
good,Ambiente piacevole mi sono trovato bene anche se c'era da correre
good,Stressful and very hard. i didnt really learn much. the managers there will literally give you a right up for moving a second slower than they want you to. it feels like if you were a robot and your just going.
good,"Hard working job and workplace culture is simple. I enjoy it, but no room for advancement because of unlawful policy changes. I feel the employees that have been there the longest are depended on heavily and misused because management will use that person's skills to its limits."
good,J'étais dans l'équipe de nuit donc mes journées de travail était complètement décalé mais c'était 21h - 4h avec deux pauses de 20 minutes
good,"Decent, they tend to work you like a dog. You must have a high rate but in doing so you will exhaust yourself beyond reason. They make a huge deal about your rate, which is not as important as the other things they should make a big deal about."
good,"Job is not for me. I think I can do better in an other place."
good,"Well organised and demanding workplace, always a lot to do and never a dull moment, the only concern was flexibility, not many people were able to choose what area they wish to work in."
good,I would not recommend this job to anyone. The Hr department s very unorganized and confused at times. You cant contact anyone to let them know you will run late or cant come in
good,"Departments vary, but the goal is the same - to take care of customer orders. Whatever job you are assigned, you perform that role to 100% expectation. Some jobs are harder than others, and not performing well will result in feedback from your superiors, which will only escalate if it's not corrected. Management is there to make sure the job gets done, and to work with associates on various issues. The culture is unique, as a lot of different people from different background will be on shift. The co workers and benefits of the job is probably the best thing. Hardest part is living up to the high expectations, which isn't impossible, but can be challenging at times."
good,"Pay is ok but not great too live off of. Very long hours. "
good,"I worked as an associate in a fulfillment center, making me one of the lowest individuals on the pyramid. As a company, Amazon could show some more love for its employees."
good,Begin the day a 6:30 and ended at 5:00pm.  Two 15 minute paid brakes with a 30 minute lunch brake that was unpaid. Very hectic work environment. Getting paid for the hard work was my best part of the job
good,night hours not recommended for women long tired nights cant talk with co workers 15b min lunch for part time 30 min lunch for full very strict alot of packages coming down the line tumbling over the line
good,"The first couple of hours is training, then your on your own it is fast pace and having to meet requirements is really essential or one of the many managers would come to you about why you didn't make the quota for that time period. Also if you had any previous injuries from anything like a sports event, or anything else eventually they may reappear as you work at Amazon"
good,it was pretty boring but benefits was good and i learned how to pack boxes the hardes t part of the job was the hours i felt they could be more flexuble
good,Ive been here 6 months and its good but the enviroment is just deptessing also the moral of the associates has to be at an all time low. Some times i makes you not want to work here
good,"Its a good work places with good vibes"
good,"great hours and pay is awesome, fast passed . alot of in and out of the car so you need to be fit to do this job you are also always going up and down stairs at appartments so that gets tireing but againtfor $30 an hr the job isnt bad at all."
good,Working Back Half Nights will cause you to get Divorced and Never see your family. The work was not hard and the atmosphere was very tolerable. If they would adjust their schedule to a Rotating 14 day a month work schedule. It would have been the best place ever to work.
good,"Pays the bills. Everyone dreads work everyday, you decide. You meet a lot of people that is the best part other than that, doing the same thing all day sucks."
good,I loved working at amazon it was a real laid back job but not I personally did not like the hours I was scheduled to work! I also worked in the logistics department and it was non stop calls...
good,Poor management.... Most Managers had favoritism towards some people. If you stopped the job to go to the restroom and it took you more than 5 minutes you would be asked to explain why it took to long.
good,"Amazon is not a bad place to work. However, the management does cause a lot of unnecessary stress. The job aspect is not hard, but the environment is rough. Granted, the paychecks made the weekly emotional swing worth it. If I hadn’t had a health issue I would probably still be there."
good,Systeme sind verbesserungswürdig sowie interne kontaktmöglichkeiten.
good,"Seasonal employment providing a clean working environment. Different jobs to choose from all requiring you to be in good physical shape. All jobs require standing, stretching, bending, walking, reaching and turning throughout the day."
good,"great place for seasonal work however can takes its toll in the long run. extremely long hours with wages that do not match your efforts."
good,"Good company, but not a place that you expect to grow. Also, More on-boarding training needed before new employees are thrown in the fire. The first couple of weeks can be very confusing on where to find the information you need that pertains to your job."
good,"Scanning packages for 4 hours a day on your feet, lifting packages and building pallets. Most of the managers are nice, they always give you things for free."
good,If you are looking for temporary work till you get ur dream job or while u r going to school then Amazon prime is perfect for you. It gives u lose hours with weekly pay.
good,"Generally, it is a good place to work. The overtime was a bit of a hassle as it was required and they would only tell you this the day before. Taking breaks was not always easy because of the walking distance."
good,"Fast-paced ever changing work environment. Must be able to adapt to frequent change and troubleshoot fires for candidates and teammates. High-volume scheduling, very independently driven. Not much guidance from management. Specifically found it more challenging scheduling for AWS org due to their very alpha male driven culture with a hostile expectation to drive results without taking on personal ownership for missteps in overall processes and candidate pass ratings."
good,"Was a very long day mostly standing in one spot. People there were nice and manager were ok, but very hard on your back knees and feet. definitely need the correct shoes for this job"
good,"Amazon, at level one, is not a job for the income, as it doesn't really cover cost of living in the area. For someone with a spouse/partner it is great additional income. Benefits are great and start on Day One! It's fast paced hard work."
good,"Not a bad job if you need to put in 20 hours a week, however you will rarely get more than that. Pay is good compared to many alternatives but work is very menial and repetitive."
good,"I was an an Amazon flex driver . . . For the most part it was okay, sometimes their warehouse was messy and unorganized I can say the experience overall was okay."
good,"They hire almost everyone, which means theres slackers and hard workers. Most of the work is left on the hard workers, while the slackers do next to nothing. You can easily get written up for the dumbest reasons, while the slackers get away with..... doing NOTHING."
good,"While the caliber of co-workers is outstanding, and you're provided with all of the resources needed to do your job, it's a mutual understanding that you will have NO life outside of Amazon."
good,"I worked the night shift at the Amazon Tolleson location, I came in at 6 and left 3. I worked 4 10's. The schedule was nice, I liked having 3 days off and the job wasn't too hard."
good,"Pay and hours for full-time staff seemed to be average for demanding work. Production targets were challenging. People get to take their dogs to work,"
good,"It was comfortable environment and I was always learning new stuffs. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all the staffs i had to work with. The hardest part was been laid off,"
good,Sore and beat. Always expendable and never empathetic if you were expected to go out of town. It was a competition where the best picker got a gas card.
good,"Amazon's benefits are excellent. Understanding that the company is online and much of their interactions with you are also, the impersonal feeling there is understandable. They are a high turnover ratio company and will fire you just add quickly as they well hire you. Sometimes (usually) their management complaints are extremely petty but if you come to work and do work you should do well there. Even though you can expect to be written up at least two or more times"
good,i didn't like that your job was based off of a set quota which was hard to hit most days and how you would get a write up if you couldn't find the product
good,"its okay if you need a job, be prepared to walk and stand for long hours. the benifits are pretty good, but the work is repetive, and its non stop. almost like being in prison."
good,ok but not recommended The managers on the whole dont really care and to most of them you're just a number rather than a valued employee. They have decent benefits but counters with a very low pay scale.
good,"Amazon is still trying to figure out where they fit within games. Multiple failed projects, poor direction, and poorly established teams are not the recipe for success."
good,"The New York Times article that was published about Amazon was very accurate, but failed to mention that while we work hard at our jobs we also get a lot of fulfillment. It's stressful and great for younger, more hungry people but not the environment for people who are less ambitious in their careers."
good,"fun place to work "
good,Start job immediately on time. Stretch as a group. Go to station and box all the items that was purchased include the recipe if it was provided then tape the box and load on the machine. Repeat the process until lunch or break or time to go home.
good,"Amazon has a great company dynamic - work hard - have fun - make history mindset is evident - Every day is Day 1 company culture - people are encouraged to be flexible. You are always learning, always being up skilled."
good,scan boxes fast paced i learned how to manage boxes coming through for the Amazon company the most enjoyable part is meeting and working with new people hardest part is very hard on your feet and strenuous on your body
good,Can be a lot better. did not like how the employees treated you. Did not take our opinions into consideration all they wanted was there quotrs is met.
good,I was terminated do to public Transportation not picking up on scheduled routes on 2 occasions therefore I was terminated I was told that they can not excuse that absence I emailed MTA transportation services do to this but was not accommodated at all so I lost my job do to this
good,"Its was fun working here t first but you would get super busy , and the hours where night shifts and you would get tired but you had to keep working no matter what"
good,"Nearly a fire drill pace all the time. Very complex organization with changes and reorganization occurring constantly.  New managers in and out. "
good,my duties was to pack single items into boxes it was 10 hours shift had to hit rates hourly was very fast paced job the most enjoyable part of the job was my shift was monday to thursday so i had every a long weekend off
good,"Labour intensive work, but good team dynamics, good wages and staff support."
good,ti insegnano bene il tipo di lavoro da svolgere ma hanno un ritmo molto veloce
good,Amazon was ok job for right now but the management was okay they did what they suppose to do what I learned you have to stay busy. amazon was a job that wanted to get better. NO BENEFITS FOR part time employees.
good,In a part time they offer 3 to 4 hours a day and there were days that they only worked 2 hours and in the week they did not even reach 20 hours. They must comply with the hours they offer. About the organization if they assign you an area of work the supervisors must be aware of the employees since the permanent ones go where they want and the new ones do not know where to be located.
good,"I enjoy working at amazon.  Unfortunately at the fulfillment centers, its all part time with very few full time positions.  If you like very early shifts, its a great place to work while looking for other jobs."
good,"You need some serious human experience training. Stop treating ""associates"" like bodies. Most people find an area they feel comfortable in and stay there. I worked in ICQA for the entire time I was there. No one learned my name, said thank you, great job. I never once met my ""supervisor"" One of the most saddest points of my life was working for you."
good,"Ich habe damals bei Amazon angefangen als das Werk in Pforzheim neu eröffnete."
good,"If you like to constantly walk or stand for 10-12 hours a day in one single space, than, this is the job for you. I hated it. I dreaded going to work and i only worked the weekendds."
good,The experience that Amazon provided me with is eye opening.  I feel I have learned so much about so many things in the last 2 and half years.  The different cultures of people coming together to fulfill customer's orders is brilliant.
good,"its was stressful but i learned a lot "
good,It is easy to keep a job at amazon as long as you follow all of the processes. I have only had 2 write ups in 3 years. Never was close to termination. The work is hard but very easy. The hardest part is staying at work as it is tiring on the feet and very boring. The moral is awful. I stay for the benefits and the time off but the pay is not enough for me anymore.
good,"We start at 5:30 in the morning with a group huddle, where we then stretched and talked about are day. Then we broke off into to groups to start work."
good,"Nombreux avantages dans l'entreprise. Cependant, le rythme de travail en équipes n'est pas toujours simple."
good,"ICQA was pretty fun, new managers kind of ruined the experience. Pay was good, hours weren't that bad to work honestly. Until peak season then you are on mandatory 60 hour weeks."
good,Fast pace work day. Learn how to work as a team. Helps you work towards your goals rather its to move up in the company or training provide it for a different company. Workers with all types of cultures and disabilities. The hardest part would be keep up with the fast pace for 10 hours a day. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people.
good,"The management team is more focused on productivity than the members of the team that work with them, the benefits were great, and you do make friends with some of the people you work besides, Amazon, nor management warn you about peak season which goes from your normal 10 hour shift for 4 days, or 12 hour shift for 3 days, it then goes to 12 hour shifts 5 days a week that no one warns you about."
good,the short time I worked at amazon it was a great exspirence and the people was nice but the pay at the time was not that good starting at 11.00 ph so I resinged
good,Une entreprise qui a beaucoup d’offre d’emplois et une ambiance agréable
good,i am hard working and always turn up on time also do anything I put my mine to and can keep up with my targets just get on wirth anything they throw at me
good,I met a lot of people from all over it was great . I personally work in fast pace and this job was perfect for me . The hours were long but worth every minute. The money is good there .
good,fun place to work overall good management and good people. I didn't want to leave but I had to due to personal reasons beyond my control. I really like Amazon.
good,"Even though it was a seasonal position, the culture was different than the values stated.  Stay on top of your attendance as I got points assigned when I had been asked to go home early.  My attendance was excellent but Human Resources was very slow to remove them.  Also, had to stand in line for over 45 minutes after my shift several times in order to correct the attendance point system."
good,A typical day at work started with trying to get to the time clock on time because there were so many employees. Morning stretches were mandatory and after lunch. Which was enjoyable. But everyday was redundant of doing the same thing everyday nonstop and feeling watched all the time.
good,"Usually we work four days a week, but during peak season, which is thanksgiving to Christmas, we work five days a week. Shift is 10 hours per day but as a manager it is 12 hours."
good,"Amazon is an alright place. Though they do constant changes. Management did an OK job, but I think they could use some improvement. This goes for the hiring process as well. It seems like they would just hire anyone."
good,"No comment. Pay is low for my position to be a forklift operator. The quota for the pickers with the obstacles we face day in and day out is ridiculous. Forklifts breaking down all day everyday, yet and still they are on our backs about pick rate. Job is overall not that bad, given better pay and a more down to earth pick rate, this would definitely be great place to work for."
good,"I worked for a company that contracted with Amazon. I would have stayed but my company was unable to pay me more for the work I was doing. I was only trained for 1 hour to launch 2 warehouses and manage 3 in total. I love the fast paced and fly by the seat of your pants work environment. Like I said, I would go back."
good,"Overall a good job, if there will be a better management about employers."
good,"A challenging and fast paced job/work environment.  Long hours.  Must be quick, efficient and accurate.  Lots of bending and stretching.  Good pay could be better."
good,Overall it wasn’t a bad place to work. Management left a little to be desired. Most of the managers there aren’t very receptive to changes or others opinions. They are very robotic when it came to the job. They did however seem to care about the well being of their employees.
good,VERY STRESSFUL PLACE. LOW PAY. LOTS TO LEARN .Not a fun place to work at all. too much politics.Very good first warehouse job since they are willing to train you in everything.
good,"Fast face environment, stressful, inconsistent management, low moral employees. break time is only 10 minutes, they have VTO  voluntary time off if you want to complete your shift."
good,So so experience. I went to school so this job made me very tired. It felt like they were always ready to fire someone and they just kept increasinf what they wanted people to do.
good,"The company is good enough. Very fast paced environment anyone having poteintial of working fast working can work upto a long period of time here."
good,une bonne ambiance au sein de l'entreprise avec des animations aux heures de pauses
good,"At Amazon.com you get to work with great people in a very good "
good,"I was an interim U. S. Payroll Manager for the company during a time when they were doing many acquisitions. "
good,Was only seasonal work. The atmosphere and management team was easygoing. Was a long process after the interview and drug test process. Only got few hours due to high demand of employees
good,"Amazon warehouse is a fast pace jobs, you would think they would rate you on your mistakes but it's really all about how fast you work. If you don't have an eye for items and able to work at a fast pace with out making mistakes, I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone."
good,Abwechselnde Tätigkeiten im bereicht Lager - Logistik.
good,"Depending on your schedule you might get a break or even a lunch."
good,"People were enjoyable, hardest was fixing all the issues, typical long days. Working with the company wasn't bad, however there are a lot that could be improved. It would be easy if everyone worked on it."
good,"Hours vary depending on volume.  Very fast-paced and labor intensive.  Never had a bad manager, but their bosses I don't think ever took psychology.  Your experience may vary."
good,Due to the lack of misunderstanding  to employees threw a temp service it was rated unfair being unable to produce  they product as your not train to do do but exspected  to perform as they need you too then your facing determination
good,"Working for Amazon can be very demanding; with long hours and a fast paced working environment that rarely slows down, however if you're willing to work hard and give the 110% the company seeks of you then promotional opportunities and recognition from your superiors are practically guaranteed. Furthermore, Amazon does offer benefits and special work place incentives to keep you coming back and to ensure the work environment is not just productive, but enjoyable."
good,Working with Amazon was a very physical experience for me and posed quite a challenge. You must be able to stay on your feet for up to ten hours and must be able to work at an incredibly fast pace.
good,"A typical day includes being switched from departments at moments notice without any clear objective. Favoritism is strong here and hard workers who don't stand around to chat are seen as robots."
good,Over all great company to work for. Very good orientation/training program so all new employees are ready to start when they should be. Offers competitive pay with lots of added benefits though the season.
good,I would recommend Amazon as a place to work to a friend if it was really needed and they were not looking for advancement. They are still just starting out so they are moving at a slow pace. Management is ok just young and new. For the most part we all get along . That is the best part of our day. We spend most of our day together so you have to get along. The hardest part of the job is when it gets slow and there is not much todo. All in all Amazon is there if you need a job now. Not to many people could make this a career.
good,"A good workplace, no chemicals, no smelling, but the job is with lot of pressure and fast paced, sometimes you have to walk more than 10 miles as the work orders are less. If you are youngster, the walking may be good but you get tired in the last hour."
good,"This company is hard work when it comes to moving inventory. Long hours but it is a good company over all to work for, and  you definitely work hard here."
good,"I had to be fast to work as a AFM some days it was slow but they still expected a lot for you. I had to reboot drives restock shelves, supervise conveyors and a lot more but overall the job was nice."
good,This place has a high turn over rate. Write ups are very common for things out of the employees control. We get two breaks one paid and one unpaid. During peak season we are required to work 60 hours per week.
good,Great learning experience. Comes with good benefit if directly on amazon payroll. They can make the stowing and picking process less robotic. Humans are expected to work with robotic precision .
good,"I enjoyed working with in the amazon culture, but the pay was not where i needed it plus there was drama on my shift at the time. So if at a last case situation i would apply there once again."
good,"Stressful environment, no promotions and respect for an employee;very frustrating place. If you want a promotion,have a friendly relationship with a manager"
good,"A typical day here really just depends on the time of the year and what may be going on in the area or something at the time. But this is not a bad place to work, I'm pretty sure they is worse. I just feel like they need to do a little more when it comes to their management training, pay, some of the ways things are done."
good,It was fun for the most part but would never go though Iss ever again amazon is amazing to work for but ISS is god awful they have a lack of support staff
good,"Fast paced environment, Chasing the carrot mentality. ok job if you are looking for another. Stressful till you get in the routine. and then you get complacent."
good,"they offered great benefits however it was not a fun place to work. hire and fire people all the time. you can loose your job by a stupid point system that they have established. they treat pregnant woman r=very unfairly I was working there at 5 months pregnant they still force me to go into the freezer at amazon fresh, I later switched and went to Edison location without freezer but they ended up letting me go because my time went into the negative although I had a doctors note HR Could of excused it."
good,"Overworked and work/life balance is not a consideration for management at any level.  12+ hour days, people constantly looking over their shoulder expecting to be terminated. Night shift was the worst part of my career by far."
good,amazon is filled with many people to talk to and have a good working relationship with. the managers are nice and calm about everything. you learn a lot and have a lot of people teach you new skills.
good,"it was a good job, it is meant for young people with energy. I only got the chance to work their for a month. I appreciate Amazon more now that I know what they go through to get packages to people"
good,"The position started off exciting, with promised advancement and comparable starting salary.... but slowly continued to decline."
good,"On our lunch break we will be able to buy food have coffee, hot coco and be able to watch tv. Then they put a basketball hoop in for everybody to wake them up a little. The hardest part was being on your feet for a very long time, you feel like you don't wanna go back to work"
good,i stocked shelve items for our customers to review online to either look at or to purchase. i also line loaded and stoad vehcile orders that required a jack
good,Good place to work you work hard to get where you get and have fun doing it you could listen to music while working and they some times have free lunches on holidays and good work
good,Amazon is a hard workers paradise. This warehouse is non stop boxes and everything that is delivered in a day is turn around and shipped back out that day. Very fast pace enviroment
good,Most coworker are very helpful. If they see that you need help with your line they will come over. Few higher rank assistant will stand there and watch you struggle but majority will help.
good,"they pay really well, but thats how they get you. They have great benefits, and offer yearly bonus for 1st 2 years and then next 2 your stocks vest fully. Its why majority of the individuals stick around. Amazon is very customer friendly but not associate friendly when it come to the FC side of Amazon."
good,hardest part of job standing 10 hour shifts. management great will help you understand and train for your job. flexiable work days with split shifts. offers
good,"Working at Amazon was a great experience. It taught me responsibility, concern for quality and productivity. The hardest part was the long hours, however the diverse people and good environment made it better."
good,"This job was only season and while I was there I only had one job, to be a picker. I was also trained to pack but never did it on the floor at Amazon. This company makes sure your productivity is always on par with their standards."
good,"take out route and finish as quickly but making sure packages are delivered properly. Return vehicle back to station for checkout with dispatch, making sure any packages not delivered is accounted for"
good,They over hire so when people come in it’s not a lot of work but a lot of people. Standing in one place for a long time gets tired especially after  12 hours.
good,"interesting work and fast paced with nice environment and "
good,"I would get there and do stretches as a group, then we would pick items from a bag and put it on a cart. We worked together to see that customer received all of their merchandise. "
good,very productive place to work with different people and faces.it was a very good place to work and the people were friendly..i would tell lots of people about this job
good,it can get hard while lifting the boxes from the assembly line to pallet when it can get higher than you . there isnt much benefits for seasonal employees
good,"The hardest part of amazon is standing up for 9+ hrs which they require you to stand up, if your caught sitting down you could written up.But they pay very well which makes you want to go to work."
good,it was an ok job got what needed to be done done and were constantly rehiring and hiring people. But the work load was maintanable and could be done by anyone
good,12 hours a day with 3 breaks and I learned packing I was one of the best packers in the warehouse at my picking rate nice people supervisor really know how to do there jobs the hardest part of the job is getting to the clock in machine
good,"it was a great place to start your first job, it was a tuff place to work out through out the 2 years i was there. i did gain a lot of experience, although we had to part ways, i would definatly reapply."
good,This is a hard working job great culture some times it could be a fun work place but mostly working on your feet .....................................
good,I enjoyed working with some of the supervisor and peers but overall amazon want to work you 14+ days its all about their  customer not employee.. I was more interested in the online program that a employee working there least than a year cant apply for.
good,"I found working at Amazon I learned a great deal about the warehouse business both from a enty level associate and at a mnaging position, I feel that Amazon has way too many managers in their facilities that can be hard to move ahead in the company."
good,"I enjoyed working for amazon. the compensation was great, a ton of overtime, the hours kind of sucked as I worked third shift but I got the job done and the pay was rewarding."
good,"I done nightshift in Dunfermline and i was a picker and packer, the job was good and the staff was always there when needed, the pay was also good...."
good,"né moc vhodná firma pro lidi s rodinou , časově velké zatížení a neustálá změna pracovních pozic"
good,"You clock in, do what needs to be done, and clock out. Boring, yet physically stressful. Benefits are a major plus. Decent work environment. Training programs could benefit from an overhaul and be restructured."
good,"Picking the items and moving through the areas in the warehouse. "
good,Amazon is a good company for a warehouse job. A very good start up for new younger people. Its also a good job for second chances and christmas money doing the season
good,"Job is ok if you’re willing to work 10hrs a day , definitely a physical and stressful job. Not the worst job I’ve had but they could definitely spend more time learning about what we drivers went through."
good,"Depending on what department you work on the managers will treat you completely different from other employees. Even when you stand for 10 hours straight that isnt the stressful part of working in this department. You have to deal with numbers; as in how many items you stowed, how fast you did it, how many mistakes and so on. The whole job is a number's game and if you can not keep up you are left behind."
good,Hard but awarding work. Could be stressful. Fasted paced environment. Competitive environment. Good wages for the work required. People are decent. Fun at times.
good,Amazon has plenty of overtime during the peak season. when I worked there back in 2015 it was a relaxed environment to work in. fast paced but we got the job done
good,"good way to get your feet into the work force. Friendly environment, fast paced work, with free Gatorade. mandatory overtime 10 hours work day chance of advancement."
good,"Amazon is the best workplace I've experienced, although that isn't saying much. Previous places I've worked have done illegal things like not paying me for hours I've worked and not giving me breaks for 10+ hours of work."
good,Not so grear management and not enough headway with time. Too strict. Not enough breaks for 10 hour shift. Not enough break areas for smokers. I would not work here again for lest than 14 an hour.
good,A job with Amazon is a very secure job as long as you are able to meet rates and numbers. They do not care very much about their associates and over-work the lowest paid positions.
good,"Great company to work for with outstanding compensation/benefits.  Life balance can be a little challenging but, not overwhelming.  Hardest part is to deal with constant turn over of management which interrupts culture and associate motivation."
good,Great coworkers but terrible management. Was a concept store so there was a lot of prototype testing occurring to employees at the facility. Initially was very underfunded and had a hard time gauging their audience so the majority of the team suffered the consequences of poor leadership from the store manager. Great learning experience and unilateral insight of corporate culture and management.
good,"Tons of work to do in a day, but while working here I had no idea who my manager was much less where to find one, the people were nice, but the shifts dragged on forever."
good,if you would like a job for life this is not it they will run you in the ground and ask for more and more if you would like a place that is good to its workers dont look here they put person vs person.
good,They have good benefits but your going to need them being on your feet for 10hr a day..and after being there 2 yrs they give you shares of stock but that's just to help take care of hurting feet even when you get the best shoes to wear there.
good,"If you want to be super tired all the time and have no life but make decent money, hit up amazon. They dont care aout your personal life, you are just another sheep and if you dont like the rules you can leave"
good,"I worked at the Sumner, WA Location - BFI1 back in 2014. Got let go in November due to personal reasons and I guess they said I cannot appeal it and I am forever banned from the company bc of that."
good,Packing boxes was not for me. My mind tend to linger into doing something better for myself. I felt like a drone on the worst days. On the best days It was enjoyable to be able to hold convos with other employees as to make the time go by. Some management didnt like this but the UPH and quality was ALWAYS on point. I didnt feel challenged. Management tried but they will hire anyone with a 4 year degree. The culture of the company has declined since zappos or so I hear. The hardest part of the job was staying awake honestly. The most enjoyable part of the job had to be the interesting people I met.
good,"Very fast pace environment, long working hours with short breaks"
good,"The job was cool, it just wasn't compensating for all my bills etc. "
good,"On a typical day at work, I've managed to keep up up with orders. I learned about safety when processing orders, especially around busy areas I also learned how to use a pallet jack!."
good,the work at amazon is not hard at all. all of the jobs can be easy as long as you keep a good pace. the hours didnt work for me. grave yard shift is always hard.
good,It's good job mostly for kids out of high school or going to college. It can be very annoying since they're always changing things and also sometimes the managers don't know what to do.
good,"Great for college students that live on campus. Wouldn't recommend unless you're bored, lost your job, or something else wouldn't make this job primary."
good,"My 3 yers completed amazon work. but no salary benefits...........10 hors job time, and my home to job company 40-50km distance......................."
good,Great Benefits..  management high turnover.  Mandatory OT.   Performance expectations.  Decent environment.  Work required includes up to 60 hours during 4 week peak period.  50 hours per week ordinary - possible.
good,"Make sure you have very good shoes or else your feet will never forgive you, "
good,"No good insurance,  no advancement,  good manager,  "
good,A typical day at work involves scanning packages and stacking them onto pallets. Management is fair and employees are friendly creating a pleasant working environment.
good,It was a great job enjoyed the experience and the fast paced routine always on the move never a dull moment in the day there was always something to do there.
good,"Being a delivery driver with Amazon flex is nice because the shifts are short, you choose when you work, and you can do it at your own pace for the most part.The only downsides are the wear and tear on your car and the difficulty in grabbing blocks."
good,A typical day at work as a warehouse associate in Amazon is not the fun. 10-hour shift makes a day go slow and bored. I've learned over the ten years that I don't have to work to death so I please my manager or PA so I could get indirect function. The hardest part of the job is to watch my coworker works so hard to get approval from management so she or he can get an easier job.
good,"MY experience was dreadful. Each shift I worked was 12 hours, plus mandatory overtime. Very fast paced, we were basically trying to keep up the same consistent pace as a robot. You're standing on concrete all day, so if you don't stretch you can hurt something. It's very easy to get off pace and finish all your work if you trying to engage with other workings with you. And you're being timed so management knows when you're slacking or horse playing. It's not the worse place to work but personally I wouldn't want to make a career out of it."
good,Great for college Students or anyone who wants to work flexible shifts for income. It is a very proactive place with lots of incentives to work harder.
good,"it was hard working but the environment and the people were very nice. They all pushed each other to work hard. However, the work load is a lot and they tend to push you"
good,"Work hard, play hard was the standard.  You have to be a self-starter because there is no guidance or direction.  Although Amazon claims to hire leaders, they are few and far between."
good,"I loved my job in amazon and  although I was moved about a lot and from one work station to the next and not in the same station long enough to meet targets. It wasn't very well organised and work stations were always dirty, and health and safety wasn't great either. All in all, I learned a new skill and met lots of new people and even though I knew it was coming, I was sad when I was paid off. I would go back again if I applied and was accepted."
good,Its a good Job for people who have no experience since they pretty much hire anybody with a clean record per se. The Job itself is easy but the hours are what will break to your knees. Ive worked their for 3 months now (including 2017 peak) and I can say thank you to them for just about testing me to see how hard im actualluy willing to work since I was able to get s early conversion. I was able to save for my first car so thats the number one thing I dont regret working for Amazon if nothing else but I do suggest to anyone that they should work there just until they get enough experice to work somewhere less stressful.
good,"Amazon is a great place to work, giving employees a great deal of ownership uncommon in most large corporations. The bar is extremely high and demanding, but with that, the caliber of the people you work with is exceptional."
good,Pros
good,Working at Amazon was a big change for me. Amazon is a very fast pace environment. You have some management that really cares about you and wants you to succeed. You also have some management that doesn't really pay attention to others needs. The hardest part of my job was dealing with people that felt like their voice wasn't being heard by their managers. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with people that actually cared about their job and wanted to succeed.
good,"Just wish they offered benefits, made sure their associates were taken care of whenever in need. I didn't like how they played me on my money and time."
good,"Amazon was a great place to work at when I first started in 2011, great benefits and pay, great people, and room to progress in the company, as it ran on an internal hiring policy. After the release of the Kindle, Amazon's growth became exponential for a time which caused the hiring of outside talent, lowering the chance for current employees to continue to rise in the ranks. The non-Amazon hires changed a lot in the company, and not always for the better of the employees (and by extension, the customers)"
good,"Part time , Pays good but you have to be willing to work ofcourse, work can be tiring and they definitely don't discriminate against age race or gender."
good,This job isn't the best for pay considering the amount of work that you could potentially do throughout the day. The management basically treats you as just a number and not a person. Some managers try to shorten our 15 minute break which is actually illegal. There are a lot of problems when working here but I'm still glad to have any job than no job.
good,"enjoyable days of work"
good,very different from the average idea of a job that I was brought up to believe in. the overall environment as changed along with the era of technology rising that future generations have access to
good,Pretty good place to work at. Work environment is good. Less than a fifteen minute break. Affordable lunch. If incapable of standing on your feet the job is not for you.
good,I got a lot experience in  picking . packing and stowing . am working in day shift . All staff members friend and happy to learn new things .  The most enjoyable moment computation among work to get prize winner.
good,I consider myself an adoptable person. I easily integrate myself into a new team. I'm looking for such a job and I'd like to be part of your team. I generally let the facts talk to me. I'd love to call on an interview to convince me of my seriousness.
good,"Just like the title says, they have very good benefits. But you have to be ready to work hard for them. Long hours, many products, big facilities, beware of co-workers."
good,"Cool benefits... Management can be improved. You immediately get thrown into processing with lack of efficient training, but they provide a learning curve for 30 days... Which both can be better."
good,"Long working days, very busy and felt pressure of always being faster and faster. Many disrespectful people as it is a mix of cultures and nationalities."
good,"Peak season will get the best of you but with a great leadership team, it was a great experience. Pay and compensation is fair as well.The biggest con for me was scheduling options."
good,Amazon has been there for me in ways that I don't think they would even understand I thank them gratefully for their time of having me employed there I have much to say wish I could get more at this time thanks...
good,i do not like the company at all they do not treat u fair . They Always In People Personal Business alot of bullying goin on. mangers are not un fair.
good,Diverse and simple. Excellent schedule and everyone works as a team. System isn't complicated and it's easy to catch on. Everything is organized and clean.
good,Is easy to work there but the people makes it hard since theres alot of racism and old people that think that because they are old they can treat you how ever they feel and then complain about everything
good,Flexibility was great - distance between my home and Amazon was sometimes challenging.  Site locations were sometimes not friendly.  Compensation was decent.
good,"Amazon warehouses are vastly different depending on location and type of building, for example a returns building versus a processing building. One common trend in all, however, is a severe lack of communication and organization stemming from upper management that trickles down to the associates. There's an all too common phrase at Amazon: If you ask three managers a question, expect three completely different answers. That being said, Amazon does offer highly competitive benefits. They pay above most other warehouses near them and offer ample vacation and paid time off. After a year of employment, stocks are awarded as well and can be sold for a good amount of money. They also provide paid maternity and paternity time off, which is sadly not that common in America. A typical day usually involves reminding yourself of all these benefits repeatedly in order to resist walking out due to the incredible lack of organization."
good,working swiftly at getting packages ready for delivery. Unloading freighters... Being part of a team working together making the customer the focal part of your job
good,"igh traffic, heavy paced order picking/pulling using RF devices to locate and process orders."
good,It's ok if your just doing it for a seasonal job but not if you were hired on HR is basically no help and it seems as if they really don't care about their employees.
good,U would like to get closer to home or something with better opportunities for employees.The company tried to do things right but grew so fast are not paying attention to the young managers that are giving a position of authority without no school of H.k
good,"The duties of a seasonal associates was to sort, wrap, organize, and transfer packages to the designated area.  Other duties included unload the trucks that came in, use pallet jack to move the finished packages."
good,"Great for a moment, things got a little crazy coming up on a year of employment. Did get multiple certifications while there. (PIT,TDR)"
good,I have no comments for my time at the Amazon wearhouse. Why are you forcing me to even review this company it does not make sense to be at all. Im sorry
good,"Company values hard work and the amounts of hours to put in as an employee. The benefits are some of the best you can find, but there is a lack of opportunity for growth. They hire area managers from some of the top business schools in the country and prefer filling positions with those candidates rather from within the company, which can make it frustrating for someone in a lower tier to advance and grow with the company successfully. Overall, amazon is a good place to work, especially during the holidays, when they offer a lot of hours and overtime. The main goal is to make money, and they offer plenty of opportunities to make that happen."
good,"If you are under 30 years old, single, college educated, this is the place for you. They do not like their employees to be stagnant. They want people who are motivated to advance, which often means moving to different distributions centers in other states."
good,"A 10 hour work day is a bit too much, and you have no way of knowing for how long you'll be employed. Good on salary and overtime if you want to make extra money."
good,"Was a great experience to work for Amazon."
good,"It’s not a bad job for an in between job. If you don’t know what you wanna do or where to work, Amazon is the easiest to get into. Pack department, receive, mod and tranship at the easiest departments. Wear comfortable shoes tho"
good,"The job itself is easy work, it's just how fast everything needs to be done. Most of the workers there are pretty antisocial, so it is best to just keep to yourself."
good,"Nothing really to say about working for this company... "
good,"great for someone looking for a part time job. "
good,Work from home job. Misunderstood the system which resulted in a major miscommunication. Everything was pretty much virtual and I was individually held responsible for my own workload. Major plus.
good,The pay rate isn't good enough for a single person to support themselves.  Mandatory overtime is put on the employee's on a very short notice which can conflict with current appointments or activities scheduled.
good,Awesome Job with a lot of off time. I personally just need more hours and would like a job that is more permanint with room to grow along with better health insurance
good,"My day in the HRV department involved stowing  of high value jewelry, picking of the items, sending to other departments to be sorted and sent out to the customer."
good,"A typical day at work was very stressful and exhausting"
good,"Giornata lavorativa impegnata e divertente,sempre in movimento"
good,"In all Amazon is not a bad place to work.  In order to work at Amazon a person should be able to handle being on their feet for long periods of time, ability to meet quota and quality standards. "
good,"steady pace, stressful for management communication here is lacking. Hard to move up within company hire outside of amazon.on a rate no mater who you are. They do have ample time to work with if used wisely rate of pay could be better for the work that needs to be done"
good,"Amazon requires intense physical exertion for 10 plus hours a day. It is a difficult environment to survive in, but I thrived there for two years. In the end, I needed a change."
good,"Amazon Fulfillment Center was a great place to work"
good,"I worked as a picker so a typical day at work would be using an RF scanner to pick customer orders, set them in a tote and send them down the conveyor belt. I really don't think much of management because I really  don't anything about how they operate but I heard they weren't good. Workplace culture, you will find alot of interesting people both good and bad. There really wasn't anything hard about the job unless you apply for other positions. The most enjoyable part of the job was the entertainment of people that you meet and their stories and also getting paid, maybe overtime or  paid holiday. Nice to see a decent paycheck occasionally."
good,"It has its moments, like any other job. But the high volume of work tends to make the day go by faster! They have prizes every now and then, the variety of people is what keeps these places going"
good,It depends on the General manager. I worked at 2 Fulfillment Centers One was really good about balance and trusting their people to work. The other micro manages to the extreme to the point that good people who have been there for years end up getting fired. I my self was written up for not being productive enough. I only made 97.5 % of my rate one week out of 4. At the other Center as long as your rate was 80% or more you were doing fine.
good,"Job is not hard at all, just as long as you keep to yourself and stay away from the drama. You will be doing typical warehouse work, standing on your feet all day, working on a line sorting packages, scanning packages."
good,It reviewed a personal experience through the company with interesting things Many of the tasks at Amazon were capable of an individual to complete with ease.
good,"The job itself isn't hard, but just the long hours and face pace eventually catches up to you. The most annoying part about the job is just not having long enough breaks."
good,Was good working at company cause pay was okay & time went by fast working. But the hours were crazy sometimes & worked six days. No time for personal life.
good,Long hours 40-60 a week six days a week .Was a stressed job during the holidays long hours .Standing bending for 12  hours a day scanning a number of items and putting into the right bin.One of the hardest part of the job is to keep up your speed and accuracy and have no mistakes threw out the day.fast passed environment.
good,"Everyone was wonderful whenever I spoke to them, but I slipped between the cracks in the system. I'm disabled and I was never asked how. In the end, after months of struggling and little to no income, I was forced to move back to my father's house or be homeless as I could no longer afford rent. Despite this, I very much loved working with everyone I spoke to and as a transgender individual, they were all very kind and understanding, even supportive."
good,I have no comments at this time. I am not gonna say bad or good about them. I was hired in though at 40 hours a week and I only receive part time pay.
good,"Short breaks "
good,fast pace work environment not enough sick hours late nights very stressful must be able to stand for 10 hrs able to bend lift heavy boxes for 10 hr periods.
good,"Just stay in one spot all night...just got kinda boring...and the hours didn't work out for my everyday....,............................................"
good,"Productive environment, short breaks, 10 hours shifts,  on your feet all day. You need a good pair of Nike Air Max and you'll be fine. Great benefits."
good,Amazon breaks are a big issue as your break begins while you are on the floor and you have to be back where you left your cart by the end of the break. This cuts your 10 minuet break down to about 5 minuets in real time.
good,Management was often fresh out of college with little to no warehouse experience. Constantly pushing numbers and often extend weeks to work 55 hours whenever we would get to peak season. Was not uncommon to see the management taking longer breaks and then getting onto is for doing the same
good,"I enjoyed the atmosphere and the people are kind and helpful, learned skills needed for advancement, quick paced, overcoming obstacles and having the support you need through leadership"
good,"Be ready to work the full 12hrs"
good,"Start of day is, clocking in, going to stand up to get your job description, do your job for 10 hrs,clock.out go through security, & go home be careful in parking lot so no one gets hit or hurt."
good,nie wiem co owiedziec o tej firmie za którko tam pracowalem
good,Pokud člověk nemá splachovací mozek nevydrží zde ani týden
good,My job was stressful but enjoyable.  I loved the work I need daily.  I was able to learn a great deal from the company.  I will take the knowledge I have learned and continue on.
good,I love this company because of how well schedule they have things I was able to do various of position I love being a packer being able to train people.
good,None to say it a very good company to wrk with  i love the Work place the people around amazon everything about the company is good i would really like
good,they try to fired people. even though it's not your fault.. and they make the job stressful then what it is and a lot of favoritism the most important thing about the job is getting off . because you work nine hours with out stopping
good,It is a good place to learn about inventory. Outbound/Inbound. Not everyone is treated fairly or equally but yo will walk away with some valuable information.
good,overall its a job but at the time this was what i needed to make ends meat but i loved the job it was very fast paste very clean environment and i loved that they had buses that come to get us and bring us to the work place.
good,must be able to pack and maintain a minimum of 230 units per hr. will be on feet for 10 hrs. no sitting allowed unless on break or lunch. mandatory o.t. required according to company needs
good,"If your healthy and have the skills to move at great speeds, this my be a place you can work for a few years, but you must be cautious of the other employee. Mixed signals from different managers makes for a slightly dangerous place to work."
good,"The work is hard, long hours standing, decent pay, excellent benefits,  communication between direct management and workers can be better. Very young culture, which did not bother me. Everything is done online when it comes to checking hours, pay, schedule etc."
good,"The Good:"
good,"You will eventually learn that your expectations/goals will increase to unbelievable rates.  "
good,Fun place to work. People were nice and worked well together. I would recommend others to work at Amazon. Typical day was face paced and the days went quickly.
good,Amazon is very fast paced but it pays well and it woking there is worth it. They have good health benefits if you are full time. It is a good job and you can move up quickly.
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,A very happy and pleasant place to work staff and management were very freindly and helpful to new employees. A normal was  clean and prepare containers for packing
good,Enjoyed working with associates and setting goals and accomplishing them.  The technology is very cutting edge for fulfillment centers. It is exciting to be part of a large team and set new standards.
good,"Working at amazon I was able to improve my time management skills, because it is a fast place work setting. Also at the same time I was able to establish relationships with coworkers, because we worked as a team, which I loved because I enjoy team work."
good,"Headquarters are in Seattle, WA with many distribution centers located throughout the United States. Growing very fast with significant potential in the future."
good,hated working the long hours with no breaks. the pay was decent. just didn't like how we work all those long hours. people were falling asleep at work and depending on where you were stationed you would be working by yourself.
good,"Managers were really cutthroat, making rates was really stressful. Overall my experience there helped me become quick and experienced in a fast paced environment."
good,"a fast paced job picking, packing and loading.   Basically a safe place to work.  Clean and well-lighted warehouse.  Managers --- just like workers --- were all learning on the fly.  But there was always room for changes and you had to be ready for a lot."
good,the only hard part of this job is that you have to stand on your feet for the entire shift and you have to wait for you to go on break sometimes just to stretch.
good,It was a nice place work I stop working there because I had  gotten the flu and I didn’t know I have until only day it was time for to go to work and I felt real light head and my mother took me the hospital and I found out I had the flu. And being as though I was sick I can’t call in so they just put in as no call no show and you can’t miss three days of work with no call no show so I New I was not going to have that job when I got better
good,"Amazon was a very fun and motivating warehouse to be a part of. However, I believe because of how many associates the facility has it is a bigger challenge to grow with the company."
good,this is a good place to work for they also played a lot of games gave away a lot of thing at there job.we would have a stand up in the morning to let us know what it was foe the day.
good,This job really takes a toll on your body. I did enjoy working here but at the same time it was very hard.  I was a picker and all the walking I had to do hurt my feet and back bad. After a while I was not able to keep my rate up and had to quit. The managers and employees are nice.
good,"It has a great work culture to work."
good,"Amazon is a okay environment and workplace . The staff are semi-confident in their workers , they have good ice machines , and vending machines  . The cars need work though"
good,Very fast paced work environment must be quick on your feet. Attention to detail and good hand eye coordination. People order things that I never even knew existed
good,"Good company for part time but not career move"
good,fast pace environment good workers and good leads and of course i had a fun experience as well as a productive experience from amazon allowing me to improve my skills and as well as master them
good,"My only complaint is that hourly production takes precedence over quality.  "
good,A typical day at amazon is fast pace job and your on your feet the whole time. I wish there were longer breaks and better access to water around the warehouse floor.
good,"I got a lot of experince, but the hours sucked and you were never really left with any family time at the end. I had to leave this job after 6 months because my body was aching and i was having back trouble every day."
good,"management is poor but it pays the bills. they mess up the schedule almost every week, the hours are very good but only during peak season. after peak season who knows."
good,"Working at Amazon was great, all the free coffee and bottled water you want.I would leave my home to be at work before 9am. If you have to buy steel toe boots make sure you get a size larger than your regular size just to be comfortable."
good,Night shift was filled with long hours of walking a football field length of corridors and seeing nary a soul until the 30 minute break you got. Felt life draining.
good,"I wonderful place to work st if you love being on your feet "
good,"If you're looking for a challenging and fast paced environment, then Amazon is sure a place for you.  The down side from being such a big company is that there is a considerable amount of documentation, process and internal tools that you need to get used to.  There will be a lot of Amazon only tools that are otherwise useless if you leave the company.  Great pay for QA engineers and there is a big demand for it, but the fast pace culture also means that most of the time you will be crunched to sign off on something and end up doing a lot of manual work."
good,A typical day is picking items that customers have ordered. You walk an average of 10/15 miles per day and receive job orders from a hand held scanner.
good,It was a decent job. Good benefits but as a picker some days didn't feel as though it was worth it. It was definitely tough work as a picker.  10hr days of walking and crouching really takes it out of you. They expect a certain % picked per person which is do-able just exhausting.
good,Amazon workplace is very beautiful and we have gain knowledge for this company and amazon IT staff is very good all senior and colleague is very good and no salary issues.
good,Maintaining a 100% production rate is difficult if you follow all the safety guildlines and procedures. So the only way to keep up is to skip steps and rules in order to keep up. If you are within the bottom of the pack (5%) you tend to stack up production warnings quickly which led to loss of job.
good,I clock in and attend the morning meeting. We talk about important information and the volume of products we will be working on. We then begin to scan.
good,"The people here have an amazing energy with them and deliverables are just a piece of cake. Hope the management would appreciate tenurity and provide some growth here, there is a lot of politics and only the new hires are promoted. Tenured folks are shown the gate here"
good,Typical day you come and clock in grab your scanner and go to work. Pick items off the shelf its good because nobody is watching or hounding you your pretty much on your own just as long as you make rate leadership will not come after you. They can track all your productivity on ipads and find you. Long 10 hr shifts but the breaks are pretty even through those hours. Please make sure you have a comfortable pair of shoes!! Feet will hurt first couple weeks. Bonus pay EVERY MONTH for performance and attendance during the holidays the bonus doubles and plus over time you take home a real decent check. They offer overtime every week. Will work with your schedule if you are enrolled in school
good,"i like to work with new people,i'm a  comunicativ person,i ready to learn new think's and maybe I will develop new skills.i want a normal job with normal people."
good,"Okay job, having to pay £180 a week for van is ridiculous even if you dont have a route. having to work 2 days just to cover the price of the van is out of order"
good,L'environnement de travail était très confortable.
good,"Decent place to work, they hired fast. The hours really suck if  have any type of social life. i worked there overnight while i went to school and it was difficult at times. Very very boring . Theres no music or phones aloud, and is very tiring if you're driving the pit machine around all night"
good,The amazon culture was very open and positive with a lot of opportunity for growth. The hardest part of the job is the volume of customers that we help and the most enjoyable would be having your team there to support you.
good,"Honestly $13.85 an hour isn't enough for an 11 hour workday, with a grand total of 45 minutes in break time. The work is constant and grueling, and you can be written up or terminated for taking longer than 5 minutes to get back to work. There's a scanner rate you have to keep up with, which means you're scanning and stocking shelves or picking items at a ridiculously high pace. "
good,"I get to earn money while I'm at home however,because of the increasing work load my time for my family and time to rest is being sacrificed. I was hoping that we will have benifits."
good,Amazon is one of the most innovative companies out there that can be extremely competitive but is also a cut-throat company that will replace you if you do not meet or exceed expectations.
good,"Amazon is a good place to work if you are willing to work hard and meet stretched out goals. It is fast paced most days and has the best and worst of all retail/warehouse jobs.The only downfall is that unless you have a degree or two years amazon experience, no matter how much experience or qualified you are over other applicants, you will not be promoted to an Area Manager or higher."
good,Busy day. Fun and exciting at times but like a normal work day. I have learned to get product out in a timely and productive manner. The hardest part of the day is when its almost time to go home for the day and time go slower. And the most enjoyable time of day is when communicating with co workers and listening to music while working to get product out as a team.
good,Buen salario con buen ambiente laboral y buena gente buenas instalaciones con muy buena política de empresa en definitiva buen trabajo para un padre de familia gracias
good,"Amazon was a great job to have"
good,Long hours but good environment to work in free hot drinks available  canteen on the site free parking good rate of pay hard work and constantly standing
good,Learned alot about amazon and how they operate. Fast paced. management did not know what they were doing they need more training or someone that knows how to train .
good,My job experience with Amazon was great. However the issue with me was the travelling. The journey to Rugeley was tiring. Salary wasn't too bad although the advancement was pretty forward
good,"A typical day at work involves picking or packing hundreds items, many of them 40-50 lbs. The hardest part of the job is the wear/tear on your body over time. It is not the worst job and the insurance is one of the best for the type of work being completed. Several fun things are incorporated into the work week to help workers get through the week."
good,"Typical day: reports and associate engagements "
good,"Your job will consist of reports and associate engagements. I've learned a lot REAL fast. If you make a mistake it's usually not then end of the world and can be fixed. After a year you would want to promote. For my role we work 4 days 10 hours a week. Not much overtime for HR. "
good,Its a typical warehouse setting multiplied times ten.  The rates at which associates are to meet in their various positions are attainable but a little far-fetched for the sheer size of the facility.  The communication and training are lackluster but the job is easy enough to pick up after a week or two.
good,"The environment is challenging. The work is engrossing, and most people are nice. Working independently is a plus; however, groups in different projects and roles share the same space, and some tend to look over the shoulders of other's work."
good,"Its a fun place to work at, fun people. Depending in what department you are placed you will have to walk a lot and climb 1 to 4 flights of stairs.  During peak season, Nov - Jan, overtime kicks in, hours vary from 10 to 12 hrs  but there will be games, raffles, and department competitions."
good,"everyone really just stuck to theirselves and it was just constant work to be done, with the managers always wanting to acheive more and more everyday."
good,"Un trabajo muy difícil que requirió turnos nocturnos de trabajo (8 pm-4am) y requirió alrededor de 12 km de caminata por noche. Este es el trabajo que me enseñó que tener una educación era muy importante, así que no terminé trabajando en una posición tan agotadora durante toda mi vida. Fue gratificante ser mantenido como trabajador durante todo el período de Navidad porque la mayoría de los trabajadores con los que comencé no duraron más de una semana."
good,"it was very fast pace, customer service oriented, long hours, low pay for the amount of work that had to get done, the holidays are very bad but good over time if you like that."
good,Nothing to say other than good company and yourself and I will be in touch when we get there we can just do the best we can just do you know what time I will let you doing
good,"Your gonna work long hours. But the overtime is worth is, def. reflects in your paycheck. Some of the managers act like they are to good to even talk to you. Its rough because your standing for 10-12 hrs a day. And if your in the pick department your walking atleast 15 miles a day. Your feet will feel it later trust me !"
good,"Once you get hired, everything starts off great and easy.  After you start to learn your way around the warehouse, you begin to see the favoritism that takes place/the politics of how things are done.  You can learn all there is to learn about different departments and get passed over for advancement(s).  "
good,This job is only seasonal..fast paced work environment..they offer to much  VTO.. voluntary time off..the human resources department is in the break room area..that was strange.
good,was good seasonal work did work here for like two season in a row. pay was decent hiring process was pretty much took anyone that could meet the basic requirements
good,"Delivered and routed materials to departments, using work devices, such as hand truck, conveyor, or sorting bins.  Report all unsafe situations or conditions to area lead, supervisor or manager."
good,"More concerned about quantity than quality. If you are sick once you run out of paid time off or un-paid time off, you are pretty much out of luck. Medical leave of absences are not easy to come back from through lack of communication between the loa team and your location."
good,"This was a wonderful company to work for at first. Quickly realized it is very hard to get a schedule that works for you though. Atmosphere was OK, at best."
good,Make sur the fork lift is ready to operate inspect the lift drive to the correct aisle and begin using the cart on the lift for the items to be carried
good,"If you are willing to give your entire life to Amazon you will be richly rewarded. The people who get promoted are the heroes, the workaholics, and those who can sell anything. You learn a lot, quickly, but it comes at a steep price."
good,"Amazon is very accommodating for school schedules and offers a variety of schedules you can work. You'll be trained on a variety of jobs so you could be doing a different job every day. There is a lack of communication between leadership which often brings confusion and confrontation depending on who you talk to. Communication on knew processes through out the building are poorly communicated to associates and often associate will have to go past management to find the information they need. Little to no difference in reward or punishment for doing well or poorly at work. Often leaving employees annoyed with each other and management over assigned tasks. Most of this depends on the manager currently running the sort. Many of them are good at their job, but usually they are promoted or transfer to other buildings. Took 3 years to start building new bathrooms to accommodate the amount of associates on the floor any given shift. The facility is kept very clean. The facility is also temperature controlled to be comfortable all year round. Leadership does make an effort to talk to employees about complaints and suggestions, but often no action is taken or takes a lot of time. You do get holiday pay. A very reasonable amount of time off(not payed). Occasionally provides free meals, usually around the holidays. All in all it can be a great place or poor place to work depending on the day. I would say for the most part it's great, but though less frequent the bad days can outweigh the good."
good,"Management does not really manage. The ambassadors actually train new hires not managers or the PA's, (Process assistants)."
good,"An extremely busy environment with huge challenges. Working with the peers virtually was a great experience for projects, ER cases, ER initiatives. Travelling internationally was part of my job which I enjoyed the most."
good,"Amazon is a pretty decent place to work, the job was pretty self explanitory and you were paid pretty well for what you had to do. The only part that really bugged me is that when they ran out of work to do you had to sweep the floor or go home."
good,"slow work day depending on the day, hardest part of the job finding places to put the items on the shelf. Short breaks and standing on your feet for a long period f time was hard."
good,"Decent benefits, decent pay, good opportunity for advancement. Safe work culture, people are generally friendly, management was decent. would recommend this as a good place to work"
good,"the place was fine to work, if you work hard you will have no problem succeeding. I found the work to be boring though and the management expecting too much from everyone. because of the overtime i found it hard to keep a work/life balance"
good,"Don't expect much from ISS, No benefits, and after 6 months will send you home if Amazon doesn't decide to hire you. Try to work hard to convert from being white badge to be a blue badge (Amazonian worker)."
good,"Experience in handling all aspects of warehouse functions, including receiving, storing, handling and shipping. Proven ability to verify quantity and quality of incoming shipments by proactively assessing each item to ensure conformance. Hands-on experience in preparing shipment documentation by ensuring that it correlates with process information."
good,"The best part of the day was when I left to go home. I loved the culture at amazon, but I absolutely despised the work. It was fun working there while it lasted."
good,"good payment, lots of work. not a job from my dream but well paid for start. size of warehouse was troublemaking, because running 7 min at every break for drink/smoke is stupid"
good,"Amazon is a place that would request mandatory overtime and provides a lot of physical work. However, the work is for long period of times. They are very strict on the orders."
good,"This program was great in the beginning, but as Amazon grew, it became a challenge to get hours. Then they started assigning only routes over an hour from my home. It became unreliable and with all work coming via an app, there was no one to talk with about gaining more hours/routes in the facility they'd assigned me to. It was a fun gig that allowed me to work around my kids and other jobs, and I was sad to see it change."
good,"Little flexibility with schedules; schedules are fixed-same days, same hours; schedules can be changed every 90 days if the times desired are open; some managers are better than others; they don't always listen to good ideas; when brand new management come in, it can be annoying because you can clearly tell the difference in attitude from management who worked their way up; this job is good for people who don't mind the fixed schedules, can stand tough labor and pressure to produce numbers, and in my opinion on a temporary basis"
good,Warm ups were nice before the shift started. Breaks were too short. A 15 minute break actually lasting 10 minutes with hundreds of people in one break room.
good,"Was a fun place to work, good benefits but management needs to improve. Hardest part of the job was having to keep up with rate. I learned how to work efficiently at a fast pace. I don't like that everything I worked up to didn't matter when I transferred to a new site. My problem solve permissions were taken away and they treated as if I was a new employee when I worked for the company for two years."
good,Working at amazon is very fast paced and each day is pretty repetitive. Management sucked at the time but the task were all essentially easy. Coworkers generally nice
good,"The easiest department at the warehouse. It is very hard for growth with the company. Have to be under managers 24/7  to get promoted, did not care about hard working people."
good,"Working at Amazon Rugeley was an excellent experience and I have learnt a lot. The working environment was good but like other businesses it also has rooms for improvements. When i first applied, i wanted to be a picker and have Friday to Monday shift instead they gave me role of stower and given me Saturday to Tuesday shift which I was highly disappointed. "
good,"I would start with getting told what needed to be done and sent off to stow many items in very cluttered areas. It takes a large amount of speed to get your rate perfect. You get two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch break, and if you take any extra time to stretch they will make your rate go low and will be warned on taking ""time off task."" As long as you're fast and healthy, this would be a good job. If not, don't apply."
good,Worked here for years and knew more about the system and how everything worked better than any of the managers in the building but getting promoted here is more on a buddy system and not what you know and your skills on what you can do.
good,"My typical day at Amazon was very busy from start to finish. The hardest part about this job is trying to keep up the rate all day and be able to scan so many items to keep that rate. I disliked how the management was when it came to TOT which is time off task. They didn't understand or care about much, even if you had problems with scanners, items, not finding carts, no totes, and anything else. The workplace is fun at times, they give out prizes and try to make it fun while working 10 hour. I enjoyed that because it made it interesting. Sometimes they would have donuts or pizzas in the break room, which was nice. This was at the San Bernadino location, but I have worked at the Moreno Valley location was a lot better and would want to go back there. This location was way different and better shifts."
good,"Good pay and benefits, an employer who seems to actually care about there employees. Work is very physical and fast paced, so not suited for all comers."
good,Amazon.com could be a great place to work. Based on actual job title and connection with customers. Now as for the actual workplace environment. No stability Constant changes A lot of the time associates are not held accountable for what they signed up for which leads to problems among workers.
good,Pretty much scanning packages and putting them in the correct bins. It was part time and the hours were weird (2am-5am) and were not long enough for me to continue doing it. Working less than 13 hours per week and waking up just to work for such a short tie was not worth it.
good,"Always on the move."
good,"bonne entreprise, j'espère à bientôt dans votre entreprise"
good,"Amazon is trying to become a more humane company still has a way to go.  Policies are shifting but the people who have been there a while, mostly in leadership, are still entrenched in a very passive-aggressive dynamic."
good,"Worked as a temp over xmas in 2016 and must say I enjoyed most of the time I was there. Worked as a packer and as long as you met your targets, everything was good. Was asked to help out in other roles which were covered by full time staff and got on well with the management. May have led to a potential full time offer but another job offer was made during January 17 and couldn't refuse as I was guaranteed work. When mandatory overtime come in, was definitely much harder doing 5 nights a week 12 hours each night, but they do try and keep your morale up through music, different things on."
good,you go in and do the same thing everyday day in and day out. No real management. And they treat you like a number. a cog in the machine to make the CEO richer
good,Fun place at first but the long walking miles of a picker then being tossed around not knowing what I was going to do the next day aggravated me at the time . But I was only a temp not full time so I can't complain too much I got a lot of experience from there
good,"If you are a person who does not like to work hard, don't bother applying at Amazon. They will work you to the bone! But, if you like working lots of hours, long shifts, 4-6 days a week, this is the job for you!"
good,I was picking orders that customer has placed on the internet. It was a demanding job and I found the management had a high level of expectations. I enjoyed learning a new job role.
good,"It is an okay place to work. Great benefits though, can't complain about that! Pay was pretty good. Kind of a relaxed environment, not much stress at work."
good,"great Place to work at,  fast paced,  ever changing and never a dull moment, good opportunities for advancement and growth, the benefit package is great"
good,It is a job if you need a job. It is what you make of your time there. With hard work and dedication there is room for advancement. The days are long but fast paced.
good,"Amazon is, and can be a wonderful place to work. I do believe they strive to make everyone feel included and believe in the ideals of career advancement.  The problem is that the wrong people are being promoted, and the most qualified and derserving people are the one's left scratching their heads in disbelief. This has happened to me for the third time now.  I now feel, more than ever that after giving this company 4 years of my time and dedication, its time to move on."
good,"I truly believe that Amazon is a great  online store, but I was unable to use my vast set of skills to better the company. I really enjoy taking on responsibility and i felt that this company was not challenging enough."
good,"While working at Amazon, I enjoyed doing the job I was assigned.  I was able to drive the majority of the time and sort the product with the forklift.  Loading and unloading the trucks, sorting the product getting it ready for shipment and interacting with my fellow co-workers was a benefit of working there.  The only complaint I had about working there was the constant change in management.  It was hard to get used to one manager and then they change within 6 months of being in that position."
good,the job was alright. if you had to take the dart bus then you were really tired all the time and if you used the shuttle but it was better but then you are always on your feet. you have to be ready for all of that
good,"On a typical day you working at a fast paced. "
good,Amazon Fulfillment is a fast paced work environment that can be stressful. Management is fair but firm. Amazon is a good place to work if your are career oriented.
good,"Working for the Amazon Warehouse is a tough task. It's a very fast-paced job. They have the Rate system that the employees must meet everyday. If you like fast-paced jobs, then this place is for you."
good,"dynamic work environment. Much change and a lot of growth.Various locations. High volume in the FCs, a lot of turnover. It's hit or miss there but you can learn alot."
good,"Long 10 hour shifts with good balanced breaks. A great canteen and an amazing culture. The hardest part of the job was to get there, because of the city traffic."
good,Physically demanding work. Various roles within the warehouse. Tasks are simplified. Lower room for growth. Good for students because of flexible scheduling.
good,"Amazon has created a warehouse system where each step of their delivery process is efficient and refined.  Most jobs are simple tasks with the expectation that you are to do your task very quickly.  There is not much thinking involved, but you will be required to actually work your entire shift (excluding breaks).  Workers are encouraged to compete with each other in a friendly way, but don't expect to be rewarded in any meaningful way.  You can expect to have multiple managers check up on you daily (this could be a good thing or a bad thing).  Although none of the work is physically difficult by itself, it will collectively add up over the course of a day."
good,"Expected to give your pound of flesh. "
good,"i scanned packages on a daily basics"
good,"If you can work in a fast pace area, then this job is for you. They offer great benefits. They offer great school offers for outside of amazon and will also help pay for your school."
good,"Its pretty good but wish it wasn't too far. I learned how to stow items, and put them into the right shelves. The hardest part of my job was way too much standing, and plus it was 11hrs."
good,"I enjoyed the job when I first started working there, then all the management changed.  The way things were done changed. And I knew to expect that from Amazon, a fast growing company. It just kept changing to processes that didn't work."
good,"Working at Amazon means you work with a lot of smart people, but often people who are very new (less than 1 year). There's lots of work so you need to pick your battles well and hope you have an understanding manager."
good,i would wrap for most of the day but if they need me for sorting or unloading trucks then they would call me over. for the most part it was not bad working at amazon fulfillment.
good,It was a part time job for me. I did not like working nights but it paid more to work nights than days. The job was easy I just hated doing the same thing over and over.
good,"overall good job for anyone that needs quick money and has free time to work 4 10-hour days. overall good atmosphere. great benefits. not much room for advancement in the position i'm in so i'm looking for something else. it's difficult to work 10 straight hours without your cell phone, music and sometimes you'll go an hour without seeing another person."
good,Only focus was numbers. Not the wellbeing of its employees. Great Benefits. Extremely high turn over in management. Disorganized when it came VTO associates
good,"You are required each day to attend standup which briefs you on goals and things for the day. You are given two 15 minute paid breaks and a 30 minute lunch. The building was about two football field lengths. So it would take a few minutes to actually get to a place to rest. It is very hard on the feet and back, standing for 10 hours a day."
good,Excellent work environment good teamwork fast pace work environment I've learned a lot from the company. A lot of shipping handling customers products
good,Even if you have a doctors note or note from the er you will not be able to take excused time. If you work a 12 hour ship its also very hard to find some one to ask any questions!
good,"Have to work . To get paid  ,But if has it's ups and downs . It's all about compiting. "
good,"I worked as an inbound associate for amazon. Working at amazon for 6 months had good days and bad days. Managers were very helpful and always came up and talked to us. Some days were busy and we had to meet productivity rates, they raised our productivity rates after a few months and almost everyone I talked to feared of losing their job. Other days were very slow with work and had option of going home early. Overall I enjoyed the job but moving up in the company did not seem realistic. The hardest part of the job was that the productivity rates eventually became ridiculously impossible to meet with what you were given to work with and seemed mostly set up to fail in my opinion. Had to reschedule a critical doctors appointment because overtime was called on short notice but they give you plenty of time off if you want to use it. Our breaks seemed to be short given the distance we had to walk within the warehouse. What I enjoyed most about working for Amazon was the co workers and the overall atmosphere. I recommend this job to people who love to work in a fast paced environment and working long hour days or nights."
good,"Everything is constantly changing from day to day, sometimes without adequate notice. Makes working for the company stressful when it doesn't have to be."
good,Picking packages was a good activity in which you learn to work with other people.You learn to be quick and very competent on your workplace.Social skills are required as well what I really had perfected.
good,Love the job not difficult management is just the problem no communication lack of help with associates when need of advice or help okay place to work
good,"Management never has a cohesive direction, probably better in a different organization at Amazon. Normal work weeks in our organization are roughly 50 hours or so."
good,working at this facility was fast paced and fun. Management needs an improvement. But overall it was a nice environment and most of the people were cool employess
good,Busy work environment. None stop scanning and stocking merchandise. I have learned to use computers faster and learned to stock accordingly. I enjoyed working because we are like an athlete really sweating while working. The hardest part is too short lunch break and lunch area is a little bit farther.
good,It was a stressful environment and hard to get into full time. Holiday hiring is an essential part of their success. Long term only if above higher average but even then no acknowledgement of employee value.
good,i enjoyed being at amazon.  I believe the staff is very helpful and wants their employees ti succeed.  I feel comfortable when asking questions to staff.
good,A lot of walking from one pick mod to another was the hardest part of the job. Getting weekly paychecks was plus. Water was provided at every pick mod.
good,"Must be ready to work in a very fast paced atmosphere and learn how to use electric forklifts and check products for any damage."
good,"I love Amazon and would love to go back to work there.  They could learn to better communicate with their employees and not take paid or unpaid hours away when you get sick and have to leave work to keep from spreading it to everyone. At least they tried to come in, but if they have to leave and have no hours they have to stay the shift"
good,"travail acharné , idéale pour un étudiant pour travailler le week-end"
good,"Great first job entering into Human Resources. Learn a lot about the company and basic HR duties. Wonderful opportunities to move up however, they do not value their employees."
good,This is a great place to work if you are looking for a quick job. It is hard on your body and the mamagement is not always working in your best interest.
good,I counted what was in the bins and compared with what the computer says should be in the bin .Walk 4 or 5 miles in a 8 hour shift. Made for a long work day
good,"If you're working with Amazon's shipping department, processing packages and so on, it's much the same as in any other shipping job. Decent pay, but dull work. I worked there for a summer to pay the bills, and it was fine for that, but not something I'd do for a career."
good,It's very slow paced so it makes the hours seem a long longer that what they really are not too much movement just a lot of standing there scanning stuff
good,I was told I could change my schedule after 90 days. That's not true and now I don't have childcare because my husband and I are both stuck on night shift
good,"The work at amazon is truly fair. It is what you expect from one of the fastest growing companies in the world. Yes, it can be stressful and is physical but it is doable and is a decent dollar to earn but the management is truly the only downside to the company in a whole. Im not speaking for all managers nor is these a personal or emotional matter. The unprofessionalism reaches deep to most of the upper levels such as Area Management to Ops Management with improper pettiness to even lack of knowledge in there own field."
good,the only thing good about this company was the benefits the people and management sucked it was too fast paced for me and i could never keep up to there standards
good,"This job is okay when it comes to compensation and advancement. the only down side is its factory work and there all the same, long day, strict and weekly pay."
good,"A day at Amazon is enjoyable with co-workers but less in depth communication with supervision...One of the main problem is their grading on accuracy and preciseness..Their system has a lot of flaws"
good,"Min. doświadczenia, dużo obiecanok ."
good,Amazon is a large company that fucntions like a large company. most people who work at a large company like amazon work like they work a very large company that functions.
good,this was my first job. I did not know what to expect. It wasnt so bad though. I met a lot of interesting people and I mabe some pretty good connections.
good,"Fast paced and production driven. Each process has a different goal that must be met. It is teamwork driven, and as a collective unit each individual must do their part for shipments to be met."
good,"Great place to work but the pressure is more due to the targets, apart from that it is really pleasure to work at Amazon."
good,"Flexible work days, diversified work environment, great benefits with health, dental, and vision Ins.  the downside was forced overtime during peak periods for company."
good,"Not a place for anyone 1 older , not a very good work environment building has only been there 2 years but it looks like 7.  Equipment  needs to be replaced or worked on . Over all money can be made there It's all stand up work ."
good,It was very quick paced a bit stressful at times but the benefits were good and the pay is good. I would recommend this job to people who need a good job if their willing to travel the distance.
good,"Amazon gives me benefits like health care, dental and vision plans, and even a 401k. They hire very hard workers and are very productive. They treat everyone fairly."
good,"Even though,  we moved aground a lot at work time always went by fast.  It was a drama free workplace.  We always found something to do,  when we really didn't have no work.  Some days would be busy then others."
good,Sometimes it got to be a little much. The people/coworkers are great and offer help any time you need him. I guess i would recommend it. At least I got health insurance
good,"i was an problem solver for Amazon,i trained people in the problem solve area on how to fix the problems of the products at amazon such as ,bar codes and damges goods as well as trained people in the recvied department as well on how to rap palets,scan,read lables,and how to move up to leads mangers."
good,They will drop a veteran with no remorse or understanding.  No respect for the associates who have gone above and beyond since day 1.  There is far too much high school level drama to be considered a professional place to work.
good,"This job was a good job, but I felt like it was very unorganized and unprofessional. The money was good but I feel as though a raise is needed. The work is strenuous and the amount of pay doesnt add up"
good,Amazon was a good place to work as long as you go there to work and do your job you do have a quota to make but it is not impossible to achieve as long as you stay on task
good,This place is overall a decent place to work but the work life balance is awful and no flexibility in schedules. The managers are cool but that is really about it.
good,Luogo di lavoro lontano ma con possibilità di fare carriera.
good,"place labels on boxes for shipping drive the cherry picker to collect inventory learning different departments ,getting to know the bosses ,management needed help cross trained on their jobs .The workplace was diverse and the hardest part was you never knew from day to day where you was going to be at."
good,it was a okay place to work it paid the bill. the discount that we had was awesome. but I wouldn't work there ever ever ever any more. only work there if you have no kids
good,"Amazon will work you to death, this type of work is not for everybody.  Management is good, and can be pushy. You have to understand, not all Managers are the same.  On the up side, they do reward their employees with incentives to do a better, faster job."
good,"Ambiente buono, personale molto gentile e disponibile"
good,I can learn any position with problem solving and hard work I get along with other co workers very fast learner and eager to get started well rounder worker
good,It was a nice a e to work although I'd only go back if I had to ! It's not necessarily something one would want to do for the rest of their life until retirement.
good,this is a very fast paced environment  you must be able to pick up 50 lbs stand on your feet the entire shift bending frequently you must be able to multi task
good,"Its a wonderful place to work, can learn about corporate life and also can grab more skills from peers and management. But as like any other organisation they also has politics and other cons. But overall its a nice place to work."
good,Picking was an okay job. You walk 10 miles a day all across a warehouse. There are no water/bathroom breaks and no co-workers to converse with. Pay is decent for the job.
good,it was a productive and positive workplace it kept me real balanced with work and motivated me to work even harder. it changed my mind about the work force and how it runs and made me appreciate it more.
good,"It's a good beginners or summer job. A lot of young people. If promoted you can make a decent living. Also, it's repetitive and fast paced so you have to be equipped to learn fast"
good,Manager should be more understanding with there employees. I learned that amazon should dedicate more time for growth instead of setting their employees for failure.
good,"Normal day consist of picking, packing, and other warehouse tasks. A lot of walking around a mile long building and on three floors at that. If you are a temp worker, it is good quick work but not for everyone. As an actual employee, the benefits are awesome and you are part of the company."
good,Manage associates. Perform equipment set up and ensure that all equipment was in safe and operating condition. Run production reports and council associates as needed. Train new associates and address complaints.
good,if you are not person who minds standing on your feet 10+ hours out the day then this won't be so bad for you. The job itself is easy its just the long hours are a drag.
good,"I had to quit working for Amazon after repeated phone calls from the same customer sexually harassing me. HR refused to do anything about it, report it to anyone, or even allow me to hang up on the customer. I started having such bad anxiety, I couldn't even talk on the phone at home."
good,"Must be in good physical shape.  Ability to think quick and react quick.  Stressful and at time loud.  Most do not make it a year due to stress and wear and tear on the body.  If you make it 2 years, thats stellar but you will feel like your 100."
good,This job is fast paced from the moment you get there. It involves a lot of walking. The times flies by because you are so busy. Expect to walk multiple miles per week.
good,"Great place to work but did require more of my time than I wanted to give, 12-14hr days is just too much. They want you to have work life balance but I found it difficult."
good,I couldn't keep up as my first job to fast paced to stressful certain deadline for everything.  it was a really tough job I couldn't gather all that was going on.
good,Workjing at Amazon was fun and afforded me discounts. the pace was fast. I have nothing more to say on the comp any as a whole. I do enjoy shopping there now
good,Was a fun place to work cool job i work there for 3 seasons but was never hired on permenantly the work is easy but fast paced its pretty safe clean physical activity for your shift
good,"Fun workplace while packaging  reading writing materials,all  school stuff , electronic toys, electronic  stuff,  free and  quick shipment good services."
good,"Good job , flexible hours , no benefits besides a 10% percent . Constant changing environment. Too many rules. Stay to yourself and you will be successful"
good,"overall a agood company. it teaches you life skills needed "
good,Amazon is a fast past place but good to work. Lines run fast an you have to be able to get the boxes scan an put them in a palette in matter of a min or two.
good,"Days were good but long, not enough break times, Very Very competitive, as long as you get in there and do your job everything works smoothly. Mabe they could treat they employees better, and not just a number"
good,"This company has several different schedules to accommodate most peoples lives. It is a very demanding job, and in order to maintain your job your are required to meet your production rate daily. Several opportunities for advancement. Multiple was to increase compensation."
good,very low compensation and the location of the company its far from where i live. most enjoyable part of the job is of you have resolve the customer concern or issue
good,I'm still a new employee. Been with this company for about a month. So far I would recommend to anyone. Long shifts ten hours plus sometimes. You are require to come in on your off days sometimes. If you need lots of hours I would recommend.
good,"A typical day at work is a 10 hour day with two 15 min breaks and one 30 minute lunch."
good,"work culture is good .,"
good,I was working there when the company just open and it was very disorganized and stressful. I work with great people and good managers. There where many supervisor and a little big of disorganization between them.
good,All work is easy but it is  very monotonous. Everyday basically starts out the same but management can't seem to figure out how to fix the problems or are most likely not around. It really comes down to the veterans at work to keep the place alive.
good,"Amazon pays higher rates in the industry but one has to work under straining conditions and long hours especially during the peak seasons. There are few short breaks."
good,"pull orders pack items into the box, print out shipping labels place labels on the box and send out for shipping too customers home. management staff was helpful and friendly."
good,job is really ok but management is really bad and stressful at times but the pay and perks keep you coming to work everyday plus its fast pace and really fun at times.
good,I learned how to work at a constant pace to meet the expectations of the job duty. I learned how to come in on a timely manner and meet daily quotas. thank you
good,the work day was the same thing every day they would not make us stand in a station all day and have a certain speed for the day if we would get written up. I learned that no matter the situation there is always a solution to what ever problem we come through as a team
good,"Good if you're looking for a temporary seasonal job to get by."
good,"A very hard working place, low benefits, continuous working hours, Tiring but overall very good experience, Very short breaks, No paid holidays no sick pay"
good,"It's ok to work there but it's not a long term career .. They micro manage way too much, and you have to work yourself to death to make rate.. I loved the people I worked with but hated the job."
good,I'm bounced around from different job everyday the management can't make up their minds on what they want me to do from the time I get there until the end of the night
good,"Working on your feet for at least 12 hour days. Rude associates, the managers there don't care. The benefits are good, but not enough to keep people there."
good,While working at Amazon I was able to preform tasks on my own. It was an independent job. Lonely but most times it was a struggle stacking boxes because my colleagues would stack the boxes in an unorganized matter.
good,"Amazon atmosphere was wonderful but the thing don't like is that they time you for everything you do. When click out, bathroom and you even have scan into your by a certain time frame"
good,"Depending on what department you work, the work pace varies. Receiving, pick, and packing are fast paced, but if your in stow or ICQA it is a bit slow paced. They get new managers almost every 6-8 months, mostly straight out of college."
good,"To be successful, a company must be motivated by something beyond financial success. Whether owners and their management teams are fueled by the love of business or the love of the product/service they are providing, they need to get enough out of the business to want to continue through tough times. In addition, successful businesses have owners who are passionate enough about the business to take risks when they realize that these risks can lead to being able to do business better. Business owners must be flexible and ready to jump on board with technology and culture as it changes. However, they must also avoid taking risks without sufficient planning."
good,"good benefits  and pay rate was great       the people and location was great vacation,paid time off vto  were great  all in all great place to work for"
good,"Look at the title∆, you come in first day feeling like I can do this, next day your dieing after that your dieing some more, they say you get used to it after 2-4 weeks but you still find yourself dieing and dieing and you make a mistake or slip up it can most likely end in termination"
good,"ok place to work for, most people are very unprofessional and nasty and dirty. if injured they will not accommodate your needs or have any leeway, but give you great medical and other benefits"
good,Amazon was more like a slave shift. Long hours little breaks. the management were pretty strick but they had to be because of the environment. the pay was awesome.
good,I had a great work experience here also they are nice people but they wanted me to change locations and I wasnt able to but overall they where a great place!
good,"Although I really loved my job as a stower , there was no real team work, Manager's and Assistant Mgr. not really helpful. very little training, you would learn by trial and error by that time they would let you go, "
good,Amazon in a nutshell always wants people to do more with less. They will run lean and will run their salaried Managers ragged to get it done. I averaged about 60 hours/week there. Advancement meant kissing but and talking the talk.
good,"Overall Amazon is a high performing company that has great opportunity to advance your career if you are able to sacrifice everything else for the sake of the business. The compensation and benefits package is great and the stock is an awesome cherry on top but you will work for that comp package. There is a constant pressure placed by Regional Managers to drive metrics regardless of role scope and this leads to a high turnover rate in the salary ranks due to the ""Churn & Burn"" approach. "
good,"●	SSynthesize large amounts of data in order to maintain financial records for various expense accounts, prepare invoices, and fulfill budgetary requests "
good,I would defiantly recommend working at amazon it is a good warehouse job nice and well rounded place for warehouse job great benefits and you get treated well
good,It's better for a youth alot of walking and running for this job .not good for people up  in age. I don't have anything else to say about amazon it's a good place for young adults trying to pay for school and pay bills.
good,"Good job to make and save some money, yet the rigorous activity cannot be sustained for a career unless you move up into upper management. Workplace culture can be fun, and depressing at the same time."
good,"worked in a warehouse, we walked all night long to collect items from customer orders. the warehouse had other positions such as stocking and the maintenance crew."
good,"Poorly managed, Amazon is a disaster area of a company wearing the sleek facade of innovation and sophistication, perpetually on the verge of utter collapse."
good,Long hours of work. 3rd shift was the only hours ever offered. Didn't receive good pay. Worst part of the job was being stuck inside all day. I would rather work outside.
good,"I enjoyed working for amazon, I enjoyed the weekly pay and the wage. it was through a temp service, but was a good job. it was a learning experience. and friendly company as well as co workers."
good,Very fast pace work environment. New positions hardly become available. There is no room for error and the job is very demanding. Its also very physical as well as mentally draining
good,"I sorted through product to be distributed forward to other warehouses.  Overall I wasn't very happy working for this company, I feel that they could treat their employees much better."
good,"driving to work and than working shift took 14 hours of the day out, I was not getting enough sleep and started to suffer from sever headaches. They would give free snacks at certain breaks as a plus. If they cut out the twelve hour days I would consider working there again even with the drive to and from Etna."
good,"Fast pace environment. I enjoy the customers demand for faster service, giving me a challenge on new day by assignments and preventative maintenance tasks."
good,"wont say much. the company has plenty of opportunity but with the very large, well tried to go without saying extremely over top extensive safety producers mad in nearly impossible  to meat rate."
good,"Really good benefits, they will hire anyone which is sometimes a bad thing, but overall the other employees are okay."
good,"unorganized but fun at times, needs work in house as far as management but it might be the easiest job i had ever. you learn something new everyday and all day"
good,"As a warehouse associate, I performed several functions assisting with the efficient  transport of customer packages. The work environment required some physical exertion yet nothing too strenuous."
good,Working conditions were adequate and working days was perfect for me! Only thing is I wish they had part time hours! It would have been a better fit for me
good,Fun people to work with from all walks of life. Extremely fast paced environment when they care more about the numbers than the people. Luckily the departments work primarily as a team so even if you struggle people will help you learn ways to move faster.
good,i  packed boxes for the holiday season. as well as giftwrapping for consumers. i liked my job till the laid me off in january.hardest part was running up and down stairs for breaks and lunches.
good,Amazon is very serious about culture. The work culture is pushed from the first day. employees are encouraged to share their ideas. However the work was difficult and management was not always understanding with schedules
good,"They say that they are a company of Type A personalities. This is true. However, there are many talented people working there and the work is fascinating. "
good,It was a very pleasant place to work  I enjoyed working there. There was some good people at my work place I learned a little bit of hard work. Where they place me in the work station I had a hard time
good,"I mean don't get me wrong Amazon is a great company with a Brilliant CEO. But as far as just being a regular associate my experience has been not so great. I have been with Amazon for eight months now and it started off fine but the longer you work for them the more you feel like a robot. Really not a lot of advancement in the company, been here eight months and all I got is a 25 cent raise, and then in another 4 months I only get another 25 cent raise. How the company train the Leaders to treat associates is terrible. They treat us like we are robots and not like humans. They expect for us to go 100 miles per hour for 11 hours straight not to mention our little 30 min lunch break we get. The only reason Im still at this job is because of the people I work with and bills but trust me Ive been looking around."
good,"Very busy, operating machines loud noises and over 50 people working in the building can be overwhelming but the system there works really good. We get 2 breaks and a 30 min lunch and work up to 60 hours a week when we get overtime."
good,"Amazing bosses, upper management was fantastic, responsive to questions in a timely manner. Work load was easily finished. We made history!! Miss my coworkers!!"
good,"I see why they pay so much because they will overwork you. If you don't mind its perfect for you but just wasn't for me. The pay is great though. If desperate enough I would go back, but not my first choice"
good,"Long days, long nights, especially during peak season. The turnover rate is high. Open-door policy is great. Come and go as you please as long as you have the vacation hours to cover your shift."
good,"Worked in worst places. The morning at amazon flex Leeds are pretty mental. All the drivers and the pickers are thrown into the same cages and have to literally fight over space. YES both pickers and drivers are picking the parcels at the same time! "
good,"Working for amazon was a fair experience. The work load was heavy but not out of line for the job. Management was fair and usually helped out employees when they could. the work/life balance was decent, working third shift it did change my sleep schedule but it left enough time to have a life outside of work."
good,I enjoyed working at Amazon as a packer because I enjoy a fast pace job where I am always busy and productive. The people there were easy to speak to about issues and to work with.
good,"I was a prime now associate. Low hours, high stress, management uses weird tactics to ""train"" associates into performing better such as giving candy to people with the best rates."
good,"working at Amazon.com, is an alright job. Coworkers were lovely and the reason I stayed so long. Management was alright, but expected so much from their employees, while they rarely ever helped. Working the holiday season is rough.. 60 hours a week, 10 hour days with one day off. You got two 15 minute breaks which was nice, but that's from ""Scan to Scan"" meaning your actual break is about 5-7 minutes of rest time. However, the break room had a nice ping pong table, and vending machines with a lot of choices. Just wish they took way better care of their employees, otherwise I would still be there. If deciding to work there, just know that you may have to walk 30,000 steps a day."
good,using lots of energy.learned how to manage you own route.good work place.hardest part of the job were long hours on the road.enjoyable part were seeing different people every day.
good,"hrs are too long"
good,"Started on the floor as an associate, then promoted to an admin role (asst. manager) then to a full shift manager."
good,They are slave drivers and only care about numbers not its workers. when you don't get your numbers your gone. Ive been told your a number and you can and will be replaced.  I've seen countless people fired because of numbers. the ceo is heartless and only cares about profits.
good,"When I worked at Amazon warehouse, It had its ups and downs. All the people were very helpful, and it was generally a fun environment to work in. The only downside of it was the short breaks."
good,"Typical day pick, pack and maybe learn new things about the business. I learned plenty especially when it comes to obtaining PIT or forklifts etc. Management is unfortunately mindless kids who are educated but don't know a lick about people or diversity maybe they should've been car salesmen or politicians. As for the workplace best thing about coming to work is interacting with my peers da to day. Hardest part of the day would be the long hours. Most enjoyable part would be punching out and going home. But honestly the camaraderie you obtain with your peers."
good,High paced competitive atmosphere with stress levels through the roof to meet performance goals. Daily/hourly reports to senior leadership often to over stress the employee.  When folks begin to regress they pile more on your plate until you can't continue.
good,"Not really knowing what your day will entail until you start work everyday, then at lunch you might get switched to another job if the workload was busy."
good,Amazing experience at work. Had a great time interning and being able to provide service during the peak time for the customer service department. Gained a lot of experience through teamwork.
good,"didnt like to work overnight"
good,Fun place to work at. Met a lot of cool people. Very fast paced. Wasn't the best work environment but the place was still fun to work at. No benefits..
good,You are trained very well so that you cant really screw up safety wise. Safety truly does come first too bad your needs as a worker and helping you be successful at your job comes last. They want you to be fast but just don't make a mistake. Pick at least 600 items a day but if one of them is wrong you get reprimanded and they wont tell you how to fix it going onward. You end up just making the same mistake until you are fired or want to leave. No one stays too long. Don't get too comfortable. If you think you are doing well you probably aren't. Loved working there too bad no one else did or no one else wants to keep you there. They are just looking for a turnover in associates. They don't want to keep you for too long....
good,"with mandated overtime that was put upon the full time regular associates I was glad I was a temp.   I can imagine it was a very hard work life balance for them, as It could be as only being a temp"
good,I learned how to work at a fast and steady pace... How to use the scanner gun tool... Hard Labor... Decent Management... Good atmosphere... Going to work everyday.....
good,everyone got along great we talked to each other while we worked the long hours though the time i had after work there was no time to enjoy myself i had to get at least 4 hours sleep before my next shift and get something to eat
good,very competitive environment. deparments are connected and well informed with each other. very smart people work here but also very arrogant. Not a very happy and secure environment.
good,"Nemaj ubytování,ale naučila sem se pikovat,zaskladnovat"
good,I was working hard in there . I working overtime as well.Good place to work and good people.Big werehouse and lots of job. Is not heavy job actually..
good,Obtive grandes conhecimentos os quais turbinaram meus conhecimentos profissionais e pessoais.
good,Amazon was very physically demanding. Time often flew by due to the rate at which we worked. Management and supervisors were very rewarding to those who put in the work.
good,"I learned early on that different teams experience drastically different work bandwidths. Someone with the same title as you on another team may be doing half the work as you for the same pay- so it is really luck of the draw. I enjoyed the company as a whole, but the workload became unmanageable for the team. The horror stories you hear about Amazon being a white collared sweatshop is true if you land on the wrong team. You'll rapidly gain experience and be marketable to other companies, but it'll come at a price. Great way to boost your career, but not a great option if you're looking for sustainability/longevity."
good,This is ok to work for temporary but not long term as your ideas are never really felt to matter to the management of amazon. people are all good and work with.
good,Warehouse work entails repeated work and long working hours. I would scan UPC and count product all day long. The hardest part of my position was the warehouse temperature of hot and cold. I learned the fundamentals of warehouse job duties.
good,It was guaranteed to have forty hours a week but the devices to get job done was a hassle. Go out and deliver in different areas and meet several people.
good,"Big company with vast opportunities. However, it completely depends on what team or department you are in. If you are with the good team provided good manager the opportunities are there to grow. There are politics."
good,i need bank cashier job but some problem i work in amazon. need bank cashier job. so i do work honestly very hard worker. i trust job . once i will selected i will show my level best...!!!
good,Convenient but very stressful to work at Amazon because they expect a lot for very little pay. The training is mediocre and rush. Most of it is self directed videos that are easily forgotten and leave you ill prepared for you job. The expectations set to be proficient at your job and perform at a certain service level are ridiculous.
good,"By working at home, you save time and money by not having to commute to work. But, that's where the benefits end. The work environment and training are mediocre."
good,"you can tolk to Amazom company  about me because I am good employee because I was come on time and I like job and then I was working picking,packing and shipping thank you"
good,"Very fast paced, you would need to be running around for most of the time depending on what you would be doing on the date, or you would nee to be standing for a long time."
good,"Worked strictly as a packer. Management was cool, very friendly. HR team is knowledgeable. Work is very repetitive and lack of music makes it less than enjoyable."
good,Really enjoyed my time there and the people and clients I worked with on a daily basis.  Challenged me to step into the best version of myself. Cool people.
good,"very busy work environment. Opportunities to advance in all departments. Great for part time work, Friendly people, Great management. Bonuses for job well done"
good,it was ok but the only reason i am not their anymore they fired me because my mom passed and i had the days of but they still fired me I talked to hr but they forgot i talked to them
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Amazon it is a very positive place. They always ask for your feedback & do anything to fix any problems, unfortunately there was a misunderstanding with my personal time which led to termination."
good,"Hard work will get you far, but safety is taking severely and little thing could mean the end of your time working for amazon.  But my year at the amazon was time well spent."
good,various shifts available to meet your needs.  The company promotes team work.  State of the art facilities. Innovative in their process to perform effect work.
good,same as my other review. Its a pretty basic job you gotta go in and handle yo bidness and go out and enjoy the little time you have left before the day is over since it is 10 hour shifts
good,A typical day was inventory control.  Employees were the best part of the job.  I learned how amazon operates on a day to day basis. The culture was very diverse.  Management had decent turnover and was not always the best.  The hardest part of my job were the long hours.
good,"your day consists of either picking or packing, collecting the items to then be packed. It can be good fun in the warehouse, you are on your feet all day though so try and get a good sleep before your shift starts, listebing to music and being able to mingle whilst you work is always good, everyone is pretty laid back. the hardest part is being on your feet all day and the best part is getting to know the people you work with."
good,"This job takes a toll. It pays well so that may be of little consequence, but the job is long hours, a lot of physical labor, and not enough energy to do much else."
good,Good pay when first starting off and good benefits. Flexible hours and good personal time hours to use. Vacation hours are given every pay period. Easy work.
good,"Working for amazon can have it's benefits and drawbacks. It pays you good money but you must be able to work like 10 hours a day , 4 days a week. All this being said i consider amazon the perfect place if you want to get money fast."
good,"Amazon as a company have very good opportunity. They have very nice personnel environment. "
good,"I work in a support role. I was not trained in the job I was in then threaten with remedial because I was not up to par. Which I was told usually ends in termination. I am expected to keep my Paramedic/EMT certification but cannot do anymore than first aid. I mostly give out OTC meds and apply Ice Packs. Oh, and do not suggest change, it will not happen "
good,"Amazon if time efficient, you cannot be late to work without getting docked a hour of UPT unless you use PTO to compensate your tardy. Other than that, as log as you are efficient (because you work in a fast paced setting) you had no problems.The managers seemed fine in my department as long as we followed the guidelines. The only thing I can warn you about is be hydrated because it does get hot in the warehouse and I've seen a couple people pass out because of the heat. I worked in the Moreno Valley warehouse"
good,"It was a great place to be, fun people fun work. Just hours are crazy. But overal fun.............................................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And the best part are the break rooms and bathrooms"
good,"Working here is a lot of information. Once you get it everything comes to you. It is tiring though, starring at a screen all day for 8 hours, management is pretty understanding!"
good,"Health - It takes a toll on your body as well as your mental state. Not to forget the amount of dust in the air and all over the bins. "
good,They didnt give me any simpathy because I was pregnant. I had to do all the hard work even though I had a doctors note stating to not allow me to do the hard work.
good,"Challenging and but repetitive. First two weeks I could hardly walk by the end of the day, but then you begin to acclimate to the pace."
good,"Amazon had a great team to work with, very helpful in the training process and very understanding. Their training program was easy to use and they made it very easy to reach out to a manager or boss when you needed help."
good,"Productive and full of challenge and in AWS, too much on call operational work and not well work life balance. "
good,Amazon is a very high demand job. Shifts run 4 days a week and on busy seasons you have to work a mandatory 5 to 6 days. All shifts all 10 hrs long with just 2 15 mins and 1 30 minute lunch break. The run off time off task and production systems within certain departments of the warehouse. By the time you reach the break room from where your work location is your breaks are cut very short. Its a lot of walking.
good,"Need longer breaks.,,, please no favoritism allow promotion ...we really need bigger lockers!!!!! Gatorade/ice machines thru out the warehouse would be great!"
good,"too many people trying to be your boss, some people thinks they own amazon, some think they are the cops working there, I see they go into your production and change the the score of your productivity. they favor their own kind of people. hiring their own family. but the shipping people work really hard tho."
good,If you are not in shape and have never work in a fast pace environment than this job is not for you. I lasted three months as a picker and I wont again.
good,Love the job not the management. It is very diverse a easy job to do a good environment. The benefits are great! HR is not very nice they are only there to get a check and not too worried about the employees.
good,this job was a seasonal position really didn't much work here. This job was only during the peak season after the season was done i was let go of. they had ask if i would like to get hired on with amazon but i told them maybe next time.
good,"While the Company is willing to pay for your time, it comes at a cost of life work balance as there relatively is none. The compensation does little to offset the loss of family and ""free"" time as its easy to always be on call or tethered to a laptop"
good,There is no negative opinion on Amazon. Either you enjoy working there or you don't. It is a good place to start working at if you haven't worked anywhere else. No experience required.
good,"Amazon is a fast-paced, productive, and stressful place to work. They are focused on the customer.  Their training is concise and safety and customer satisfaction is most important to them. The hardest part of the job is the long hours.   The most enjoyable part of the job is some of the fun activities. The benefit package is good, but the pay could be more.Career advancement is a challenge."
good,The people at amazon are very helpful and friendly. A typical day at amazon if very fun and interesting. what I learned at amazon is how to multitask and inspect a trailer.
good,Working at amazon was a good and bad experience all at the same time. Good because you worked with different people from all parts of life. The pay was awesome and so were the benefits. Bad the scheduling was horrible the hours and management as kept an attitude.
good,day at amazon was not the greatest but not the worst. i learned about rates and how to hit them as well as how to be better organizer and stock. management was fair. culture was to yourself no one to really acknowledge. hardest part was the distance of drive. most enjoyable was hit the rates being recognized.
good,Working with big companies teach you a lot of new things that you never knew earlier. Like the reasons why they are on top is clearly visible by their systematic and disciplined work place.
good,I can't answer this well because I just started. So far it seems like the hardest part will be knowing which calls to handle and which ones need to be transfered and to where.
good,"I would say that amazon needs a lot of improvement with management and pay better at their employees since they ask them to give 150%, "
good,"Amazon is a good place to work with competitive benefits and pay, but after 3 years you do not get a raise, and the work becomes very hard on your body doing the warehouse jobs. i have not yet done the at home customer service to provide a review on that."
good,"It's a okay place to work, and its not for a permanent position, but if you need a place to work for like 8 months while you find something else then that's the place for you."
good,"A great place to get your sea legs. Excellent team members, great amenities, and nice pay. The only critique is that management is frequently without a clue of what's going on the floor. Thus all of the knowledge for preparation lays entirely in the hands of the handlers."
good,"There were a lot of problems with HR, and their treatment of some associates or departments. Vendor returns was targeted by New management and new HR personnel. They tried their best to get some of us to quit, or fire us for no reason at all."
good,Management is very driven to get productivity up to accomplish goals and meet customer demand.  Even in the warehouse the number 1 priority at Amazon is customer service and it is stressed at all levels of employment.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with new employees and teaching them to be a part of the team and place Amazon values ahead of their own.
good,"I spent 4yrs working at Amazon made a decent living, good benefits, and a good atmosphere.  People I worked with were helpful and some I considered friends."
good,They have a rate system implemented that gets you written up if you aren't meeting it. Also it's cutthroat in that you move up the ladder by throwing others under the bus.
good,Work is automated and doesn't consider the strengths and weaknesses of individuals. Some of the managers are great and very fair. Others are terrible and only favor their friends assigning them the easy tasks. All in all a normal warehouse.
good,"Picking items that will be delivered to customers, in a shift of 10 hours. The hardest part of the job is that you have to walk fast and continuously for 10 hours."
good,"not looking forward going into work."
good,"off loading the trucks"
good,"Spent a few years here and was pretty good. Began doing the normal 8 hour shifts, but you do get to vote on doing 10 with the benefit of having an extra day off. Management was pretty good, a lot that I have had were really awesome, especially the Ops. There were a lot of nice people to talk to, but there can be times when it would feel like a high school. It gets super high stress, especially during the holiday season; but it does make the day go faster."
good,"Great perks, strong team environment, management change negatively upset the balance of the team's meal and effectiveness. The work/life balance was impacted in a negative way when a new management team/style was incorporated within my division."
good,They do whatever they can to make production numbers. They try to make decisions that benefit only the company. The employees come second to everything else in the building.
good,its ok. lack of communication is the problem. turnover too high. if you have good attendance then you will keep your job regardless how sloe you work. you will have to pick others slack
good,amazon was okay at the start but quickly wore on me and the managers are not as nice as they can be and they over look hard work for degrees. you can be a hard worker and they will not promote you if you don have a BA
good,"The hours for me were overnight, and the physical labor often made me feel worn down. The pay was pretty good, but not good enough for what we were forced to do."
good,"do not mess up or you will have to deal with the consequences, management is very strict and it is hard to move up in the facility. the hours are long and hard."
good,Had a great experience working there but something's do need to be changed in order to keep there workers happy and make there business a lot more successful than what they already are.
good,This company over works the employees with only a half an hour lunch break. They are very strict and you can only get at least 5 minutes in the bathroom without them complaining. The pay is decent
good,Lots and lost of walking is required for the work. Maintaining rate of work is a top priority. The benefits are really good. And the use of the cell phone to pick times to take time off is great. Communication is essential.
good,"Amazon.com is all about production numbers. If employees can easily hit their hourly goals, then the job may be very enjoyable. However, the problem is, the production goals are set very high, which makes most employees put serious strain on their bodies."
good,"10 hour days, with one lunch and 2 very short breaks. Breaks were based on scan time to scan time, so they were closer to 9 minutes each, rather than the 15 they were advertised as."
good,"Amazon is stupendous but there really is no room for advancement.   Sure, you can move up but cross training might take longer than one wishes.    There are a lot of benefits to be had but as far as advancement is concerned it doesn't really promise much.  They will, however, work with you if you are going through school to better yourself."
good,Have to have major motivation and willpower. Cannot be a lazy person. Have to be able to push yourself through 10 hour shift four days a week. The job is really all about what you make it to be.
good,"AWS team is full of most talent team. Life here is quite busy. We can really learn a lot everyday. Also, this company obtains the most updated technology."
good,Alot of lifting and standing. Ok job for someone who is really not looking for something long term. Not very organized. Stressful place for the amount of money they offer
good,during my time here i had gained experience in the packing section. I had to pack different items following instructions via a screen. Could be challenging at times.
good,The hardest part about working here is that you have to get used to always being on the move.  Otherwise it's actually a decent place to work.  There are very few problems and quite a few good things with this company.
good,"you have to keep your write up, if you keep your write up then you'll be fine. Management isn't the greatest. Never let your UPT go in the negative or you'll lose your job"
good,Amazon is a decent place to work but you have no opportunity forever advancement. The benefits are great but the job itself almost don't make them worth it.
good,This job is only a pitstop not for long-term. The pay rate is low. They're not always truthful with you. They lack experience in the leadership area so it makes a job harder then what it has to be...
good,"Most shifts were 10 12 hours. And there was almost always mandatory overtime every week. It was a very demanding job, with little to no room for advancement. On the plus side the benefits are amazing!"
good,"12 hours a day on your feet, fast paced and high intensity, long and hard hours (weekend and holiday hours are expected) but rewarding work, fun co-workers"
good,"Amazon is a great place to be an Onsite Medical Representative"
good,"A empresa tem um bom relacionamento com os funcionários, e Ótima de se trabalhar"
good,Fast paste environment for seasonal employment only. Would not want to work for the company as a permanent employee but would not mind working there during the holiday season only.
good,"Amazon has great benefits and the staff is very supportive. If you are not use to long hours of standing it can possibly be a strain, but overall its a fun place to work and pays good."
good,"The pay is good, the work isnt too hard. Its nice to work by yourself if thats what you feel like doing. Downside is their rate system. It can be unobtainable at times. Gets hot in the warehouse at times, upper management doesnt always show concern for their employees"
good,"The management can use a boost but other than its a pretty simple flexible hour job, not to difficult to meet work expectations. Some workers do not do much but dont let them turn you into a lazy woker"
good,Working at Amazon has been an experience i could not forget the workers were amazing and I never had a problem with them. They would not hesitate to help.
good,"Good company, Productive, Good environment, Fun learning, Technologies are also good, kind of startup environment, not lazy at all and always cheerful."
good,"I used to love working at Amazon until management continued to change for the worse. Everyone is so customer-oriented that no one looks out for the employees. Managament continues to reiterate that the pay and benefits are so amazing that we shouldn't complain. What they are really saying is ""Hey we pay you a great deal and your health benefits are perfect so when we inevitably cause you a mental breakdown... you're covered! Afterwards, we will decide that you're too much of a liability and we will fire you."""
good,"El trabajo, los compañeros y el sueldo bastante buenos, los turnos dependiendo en el que te toque, no guardan muy bien el orden de antiguedad para cambios.Para los de ett es un sin vivir el tema de renovaciones ademas te aguantan hasta el ultimo minuto del domingo para comunicartelo y la eleccion de amazon a la hora de hacerte de empresa es incomprensible tienden a ser muy inumanos con cierto trato hacia la gente."
good,"Pack rates went up to 230. If you didn't hit your rates you get written up. If you get three written warnings then you are fired. You were given time off. Between unpaid time, vacation, paid time."
good,It is a very fast-paced working environment where quantity is valued more than quality.Very long hours in a day. Pay rate is very good with benefits available. Very easy to get a day off but also very easily fire employees.
good,10 hour shift on feet 4 to 5 times per week.  People in front at conveyor belt get better rate than people in back.  Management ignores that and compliments front worker in front of everyone.  Devastates moral.
good,"Pros Plenty of walking sometime 10 miles per day,great fun people, great experience ."
good,It's a good place to work if you need a decent paying job  and can't find one quickly they're always hiring it's a fast paced job and you can be let go if you don't keep up
good,"There was no typical day at this company,soon as you turned around they would have new management,you never really knew who to follow up with if a situation occurred.For me,coworkers were the good thing about this company."
good,amazon is a highly fast paced work place that can be extremely tiring if it is your first tie working in a warehouse. I don't recommend this job if you a not ready to work very fast and work even harder.
good,working at amazon you stand up all day moving and operating machines.  You analyze different books so it can be shipped to customers. Overall its a nice workplace environment.
good,"A typical day is very busy but it is a multicultural place."
good,Great place for benefits and make a lot of money during holidays but once that's over not much overtime. It's stressful and tiring. Have to make rate or it's possible to be terminated after three writes ups. Easy job just stressful
good,"Working in a warehouse, i got certified for a of positions and became a lead in 3 months. I had to learn to work very fast and at a steady pace through peak"
good,"it depends on which shift you are working. I am working at early morning shift. There is not much people working at this shift but there is very noise environment. Once time, I had a bad situation that I met a leadership with bad respected to me. They did not respect to lower level worker."
good,Work in Amazon was such a fun and totally new experience for me to finally see how your parcles gets picked up and packed. good precision and punctuality experience
good,The work environment was friendly and easy. Organization was questionable at times leading to accidents with machinery and injuries. Leadership was not helpful towards understanding individuals problems with policies and HR acts only in the interest of the company
good,"answering high call volume."
good,kept track of inventory. Worked as a team to meet quotas. Used handheld electronics to track and communicate changes in inventory. Packed and transported products for shipment.
good,"i wanna working whit poepel and "
good,"Loved my job and most of the people i worked with."
good,The job is OK but they are a little ridiculous with the work condition. Money is good and they give you plenty of time to take off. Benefits are good.
good,"Typical day at work starts from briefing, then we do our tasks. We have 2x15 minutes paid breaks and one 30minutes unpaid. Hardest part is routine especially if assigned to same task week after week."
good,Working for amazing was pretty stressful. I was a picker there and I felt like I was a slave. They work you for long hours and don't get enough break or lunch time.
good,"It was a good place to work to get your foot in the door to warehouse jobs. Working at Amazon will give you basic skills that are needed to perform at a warehouse such as using a scanner. The environment is high paced but the associates are nice people. The hardest part of the job is meeting the minimum weekly rate, and the most enjoyable part of working there is making new friends."
good,it has been ok so far ..but the production numbers are threw the roof as far as what they want you to make .if they was to lower the number from 300 items an hour to a realistic goal it would be a great place to work for plus i think they need to take into consideration peoples ages when it comes to this stow rate ... younger are faster and more agile than the older there for the older should not have to get this rediculous stow rate
good,A typical day at Amazon was getting back from break on time.I learned how to pack shipments. The hardest part about the job is making rate. The most enjoyable part of the job is clocking out at the end of shift.
good,I enjoyed the fast paced friendly environment during the peak season. Now after the peak is over and the temps leave it's a different story.The money and hours are decent.
good,"A typical day at would be fun and productive, I learned a lot from the managers'. The hardest part of the job would be lifting the heaviest boxes there."
good,Good team spirit. Working in a team it was rewarding and as everybody got along with each other and encouraged each other there were never any problems.
good,I loved eveeything about working there. U work with alot of people and they help u any time u need a hand. Its always something to do when there is nothing to do
good,it was an ok job u just have to get use to being hot and staying hydrated but other then that its ok u will be able to learn new things and try diffrent stuff
good,"Working at Amazon is a different and peculiar experience. It's very fast paced, and your breaks are very short due to the fact that the building is so large and your department may be far from the break room."
good,"L'ambiance générale et le cadre de travail sont pas mal."
good,"warehouse picking and packing, excellent attention ti detail, teamworking, dependable, hard working,.  Streneous work.  Good pay. Working hard at a job."
good,Good short term job. Hard At first but once you learn whats expect easy to stay focused and make rate every night. Has a very diverse range of ethnicity in workers.
good,"This job is good for a college student or as a stepping stone for better employment. If you can make it through some rough work environments, and tough to deal with management style."
good,Was a good experience regarding picking and sorting out customer orders. That includes packaging and palleting  for delivery to individuals and companies.
good,"amazon has good benefits, but bad for employees in general."
good,It's hard to say because I was a temp and again Amazon had an assembly line process so a lot of times I had to wait for work. When the work came they timed you on how long it would take you to process the order and move on to the next person.
good,Non mi sono trovato male anche se ho fatto solo per pochi giorni il più pesante era la tipologia di orario visto che dovevo fare sempre la notte x il resto tutto bene
good,Management is not up to speed. I did learned to work at a very fast pace. Hardest part of the job was constantly running back and forth due to lack of orders.
good,"As a fulfillment Associate you have a responsibility which is expected to be accomplished at a certain rate. Amazon provides a plethora of opportunities for benefits and advancement . Furthermore, an employee can always count on a forty-fifty hour work week."
good,"Amazon is a great company with great perks while working there Ive learned a number of skills I can take along with me like teamwork, communication, responsibility,hard work and packaging skills"
good,I`m was working here just few months. Was actually good place to work. I was working at busiest time in year (Christmas) but I complete my missions every day. Wasn`t very hard to understand what to do and after finishing my task I was always helping other people. So time in work place was going very fast
good,I work nights and weekend shift. I have learn how pick orders. Management is pretty  reasonable. The hardest part of my job is that they don't give you enough hours. I enjoy interacting with my team members.
good,"busy days, thy don't over work you, thee is always work, mandatory overtime can be a pain if you don't want to work extra. Clean work environment, he hours could be more flexible"
good,"I would show up, wait for the bell to ring, go to my station, pack boxes, eat ""lunch"" at 11:30 pm, and return to my station to pack more boxes."
good,I loved the competitive nature of trying to best at amazon and working with great people. The days were long but the pay was good.
good,"it is a very divers when it comes to colleagues and management about 50 different countries of provenience, so you can imagine how much you can learn just from that."
good,Work 10-12 Hours A Day. Great Pay But It's A Constant Stand-On Job. Supervisors/ Coworkers Are Very Helpful With Training And Answering Questions In Completing Certain Tasks
good,"Everyday you're on the job it feels like it could be your last. It's all about rate and they remind you everyday that if you don't hit it, they will let you go. It's a very stressful situation to be in and they have the highest turnover rate I have ever seen.The Pay is the saving grace."
good,"I worked Mon-Fri 8:30 - 12:30, everyday was different, did a lot of different jobs, learned a lot, very physical and sometimes challenging work (like when the conveyor belts would go down) but we would figure out a way, the most enjoyable part of the job was working with all the different types of people you would meet."
good,"My time at Amazon Fulfillment Center was physically exhausting and job tasks are very repetitive. Working for Amazon had the reward of great benefits; paid-time-off, health care, but management could have been better."
good,"Working at Amazon can be physically challenging, you are usually on your feet for 10 hours a day. The breaks are very short, and there are a lot of managers."
good,"Working for a huge company like Amazon has many pros. Stock options, excellent health care benefits, and a wide range of different process paths provide incentives for employees to stay with the company."
good,la journée de travail est ennuyeuse... en general il faut balancer pour evoluer... on a pas une bonne relation avec les managers...
good,"Bonne intégration, métier répétitif mais rentable ."
good,Cette expérience m'a permis d'acquérir certaines connaissances en logistique mais la cadence et le rythme de travail ne me correspondent pas
good,Responsible for all HR functions in a warehouse containing 500 personnel. Generates high level labor planning reports for Sr. Operations to review staffing needs per volume. Facilitates annual training for Area Managers regarding HR procedure. Maintains accurate roster along with updating attrition/retention/performance data for weekly regional calls.
good,I worked on the line scanning the product and placing the on the pellet in a 4 foot square wrapping it and sending it off to the truck to be loaded and sent to there destinatio
good,"They didn't want to work with my school schedule and would always call me in on my days off. YOU have to work with their schedules. "
good,I enjoyed that it was a a very productive place and it was fast pacing when it came to the actual working. Staff were nice and worked with you when you was trouble shooting.
good,Hr was less than to be desired.  Always had problem with personal time. And i got hurt at work and went through so much just to get work comp. I had to threaten to get a lawyer to even get a return call.
good,At Amazon you learn alot about what is expected to do at a warehouse. Fast moving place with goals to reach each day.. hardest thing to do at Amazon is having to put away over 400+ items and only be able to make 1 mistakes and you get written up
good,"Enjoyable place to work, fast paced environment, excellent customer service, good team players, good support provided whenever needed"
good,"Various requirements presented to me each work day, worked on mechanical and electrical issues, as the facilities engineer I also worked on lighting, water systems backup generator and required inspection of bathrooms"
good,"While working at amazon they did not work arud my school schedule, however the pay was really good. It ws fast pasted but really easy duties."
good,Great money but work is over whelming when no change of scenery or position for hours at a time. Management was okay for the most part but at times only cared about work not the workers.
good,"I absolutely loved the fact that they gave employees pep talks, and motivated us to always stay above on productivity. They were very hands on making sure everyone was working at a steady pace and that we take our breaks and lunches. In addition they had prizes for the hardest worker with the best percentage level of working pace for each department."
good,Even though I retired from Amazon I would not go back. Management has no people skills. They make the job more harder than it needs to be.
good,it is a very busy productive workplace were there is alot of communication as well as alot of work there so you will not be standing waiting for work
good,Mise en rayon et préparation de commande. Travail d'équipe et poste dynamique
good,An excellent esprit de corps experience daily.  Excellent corporate attitude.  Good hiring and promoting practices except for the facility I was at.  My facility had a horrible HR department but corporate  policy was excellent.  Good benefits.
good,"At Amazon Fulfilment Center, I've learned how to use the push pill pallet Jack. I had to get a completed pallet to ship it to the trucks. I learned how to use a scanner to scan in the packages onto the pallets. I've learned to close a pallet as well. My part tim seasonal with Amazon was a nice experience."
good,"Its hard work,alot of walking,standing,plus you unload trucks,and load trucks,its good place to work for young people, for older people it takes a tool on your body...management are on your butt to move faster"
good,"This is a fun, multicultural and fast paced environment to work. They offer great benefits and accommodations for its employees. such as career opportunity and other benefits for full-time workers."
good,amazon is an excellent place to work very clean fast pace and respectful staff. My only concern is the work we never really had much work to do some people like it some don't 10 and a half hours is a long time to just try and stay busy but when there is work the time go by fast.
good,Amazon is a place where you can come in and get out at a reasonable time. The work is not to complicated but you will be on your feet for the majority of the time. The hardest part about working at Amazon is keeping a high scan rate. The most enjoyable part about working at Amazon is at break time they may have snacks and treats. Also they have a system where they may give away electronic items and gift cards.
good,"long hours."
good,"Ok job. Expect a little much, with little rewards. Want you to put in 120% a quarter, for 5 RIC bucks. When a t shirt cost 20 RIC bucks at the store. And it's random who wins."
good,a typical day at work was very challenging but it was fun at the same time......i learned about customer service and fulfilling customer needs....
good,"Good place to work if you want to be active for 10 hours a day, very fast pace, with a verity of different people to work with, well rounded, and a very clean place."
good,"I like how accepting this workplace is, and how many friends you can possibly make. They have free beverages like powerade and coffee, and many different vending machines to choose from in break rooms. There are games to play on breaks, employee telephones and computers to use. I feel one hand doesn't know what the other is doing when it comes to management, and it can be a very disorganized place on occasion. Daily quotas sometimes do not take into account restroom breaks, trying to find tools to do the job etc. The breaks are short and hours are long, especially standing and doing the same task over and over again. Unless you get fired for disciplinary action, you can however always reapply, it seems they always need people to work here. Benefits are very good for full time Amazonian, but through the temp agencies you may need outside insurance. Pay is fair, but could be better. There is a lot of networking and activities you can get into in the community as well as the workplace. Most people are friendly and helpful. There are different jobs and shifts you can always apply to transfer unless you are on probation or are a new hire, although that doesn't mean you will get approved. If you manage the time off given to you when you start it is fair, but holiday schedules could be coordinated better, as well as the VTO and VET notifications for both direct hires and temp hires. There is opportunity to grow with the company if you are willing to put in A LOT of time at the company doing remedial work. Overall it is a good company to work for for a time, just not to make a career"
good,"Great benefits and friendly co-workers, but very poor communication with leadership. Departments rarely were on the same page with standard procedures."
good,It is an OK place to work. It requires a lot of standing and moving around.  This would be a good job to recommend a person with  high energy and flexibility.
good,"Plutôt bien mais très physique , il faut être motivé et tout donner , il y'a un rythme à prendre qui n'est pas simple pour tout le monde mais pas impossible ."
good,"Always have ID/Pass on hand at all times. I learn how to work in a face pace environment and keep full focus on whats next. The management was a bit poorly on some days but not all days. The challenging part of the work was to complete the job description in a short amount of time. The scanner shows a time clock counting down to where you had to find items from one side of the building to the other. You practically have to rush which was kind of exciting. There was a No phones policy on the work floor and yet, some employees still carried them. The best and enjoyable thing about the job was meeting new people everyday. The place had character."
good,"Horaire : 2*7"
good,Long shifts. A lot of walking. Friendly peoples who always want to help. Extra overtime. No problem with agency or anyone around.
good,fast paced and goals are hard to attain. working with others is really not an option. all about money and time. quality of work is last to this company
good,"not a good work place.no growth,no compensation.no appreciation for work.too much favortism..better opportunities outside india.amazon global opportunities"
good,I liked my job In Amazon.  The people there are so friendly but some of them are racists that's why I live my job. I was working day shift and I been happy with my job.
good,"I worked as seasonal fulfillment associate in amazon fulfillment center under new year peak."
good,"My experience with Amazon Fulfillment Center as a place to work is that the job condition varies greatly depending on the position. When I was working on the shipping dock, work went well and relied on personal performance as well as team effort. When I worked as a picker work needed to be done at an almost frantic pace, was a completely solitary effort, and I noticed a high employee turnover rate as the slower employees' were replaced. Also when I spoke to other employees' about how they felt about their jobs in other departments, opinions varied greatly. "
good,I did not like working for them they were a new facility and they did not know what they were doing. I would go back if I knew that they had worked out all of the kinks in the system
good,"Multicultural environment requiring walking 10+ miles and ensuring attention to detail, accuracy, effectiveness, inspections and situational awareness."
good,"it is a productive place to work but the managers are not friendly, they only care about quantity over quality, they managers and PAs play favoritism."
good,I love the company. The people and the benefits. Working with the company has helped me build my body strength and showed me proper ways of lifting and stretching.
good,"fairly enjoyble workplace."
good,"At amazon, you will load and unload trucks, drive a forklift, returns, fill orders and lift boxes. The hardest part of this job is long days on your feet."
good,"Is a good workplace, where you can make a lot of money in the busy time, but is not a sure place, I mean it is just temporary, and I prefer a permanent workplace"
good,"it was ok at first but management really sucks. one manager tells you one thing and another tells you to not listen to them and to do it their way, they don't respect the peons."
good,Long shifts and supervisors were disrespectful during working hours. Either than that it was a calm environment and sa
good,"benifits, pay and fast paced nice during the holidays, but they do expect lots from you, breaks could be longer, and lunch could be paid for everyonce in awhile."
good,"Great environment but it's labor so the job would hurt my back. The pay was good but the only time you get good hours are during hollidays. Although, they would give you prizes every now and then depending on your work so that was a nice touch."
good,"management is too strong,there us no holidays,salaries are not up to date,insufficient salaries,working hours are heeavy.there is no job satisfication."
good,"I like the diversity and flexibility. Ive learned how to work in a fast pace environment. Lead pre-season, in-season and postseason training practice games, effectively managed off campus recruiting, evaluations a visits"
good,Overall good atmosphere. Associate engagement and reward system in place however not properly structured. Middle level management is left to handle performance issues with minimal support from upper management.
good,While working at Amazon I gained some helpful skill like communication and problem solving it is a friendly in environment where you can meet amazing people
good,"Not really the place to be, don't treat there employees with much respect, get spoken too like a child, but if you're willing to run around like a headless chicken all day then feel free."
good,"Very many polish speaking employees."
good,"They only care about your rates if your even a couple underneath your daily or hourly quota you get talked to.a typical day revolves around a meeting then you get your scanner and goto the bin pick, stow, or count the bin and it just repeats all day"
good,"They do not understand that sometimes things come up and you cannot make it to work, or you may be late for a very understandable reason such as poor weather conditions. They will still reprimand you for missing a day if you are in the hospital, they don't accept doctors notes. They do not cross train or allow position changes unless they are understaffed, are unorganized and lack communication. Nothing is set in stone for you at amazon, you could have a different job title and department every day based on what they need."
good,"Performance, agilité, imagination, satisfaction client."
good,"•	Responsible for outbound merchandise, driving order picket, picking with RF scanners, line loading, slamming, tape machine, rampak machine, merchandise diverting, and truck loading."
good,"meeting new people, my manager was great. in all it was ok. i learned alot from there. met different kind of people from different countried. management was ok"
good,It was a hard working job were I was on my feet none stop but the pay was good. my management had a good understanding. the hardest part of the job was having to constantly be on your feet.
good,Hard to get to know other coworkers although you are working 5 feet away from each other. They are very strict about having your time up. Never saw my manager probably only once for five mins. through out my shift.
good,"My very first real job so I was super excited in the beginning to work here. As the years go on , you feel stuck unless you move up within the company which isn't very easy."
good,I liked working here because of the fast paced environments and the great pay. There are a lot of downsides to the job but what job doesn't have a downside.
good,le falta mucha logistica y en la forma de despedir a un trabajador deja mucho que decir es algo muy inhumano.
good,"I enjoyed the work which was picking items from shelves and putting them on the conveyor but I didn't enjoy the long hours, compulsory overtime and long distance travel to work."
good,a great and fun place to work. Pay is also good but the hours are extreme and you dont really get much time to yourself. various hours and shifts available
good,"if you are sick and bring in a doctors note to be excused, they will not accept it. you are only allowed sick time that given to you."
good,"Amazon is a professional company with customers on their mind and they make sure that the customers are their number one priority. The first few days learning the jobs are the best but without excelling in what was taught then no company progression will be made. The Co-workers that are there are all friendly and interactive including the managers but there is a big lack in communication between individuals. Some Workers and including the Managers will need to ask others on what is needed to be done. The only hard part of the jobs given to a person is just being able to focus because there is not much difference in the jobs given day to day. However, once taught multiple task there is some variation and the task become more enjoyable and less predictable."
good,Bien l'équipe  le travail sportifs sinon jai bien aimé travaille la bas
good,I had the privilege of working behind the scenes of the number one customer service company in America. I really enjoyed the people I worked with. The best part was doing the work with my fellow workers.
good,"Amazon likes to say they move people up and promote people to higher positions whenever possible. But in reality they choose favorites and move people up that way. And it is not typical warehouse work, the work they have you do is extremely mind numbing. I often got headaches from doing the work they assigned me everyday."
good,Not too many positives just a lot of headaches. Usually got along with my management and co workers.  The main issues were with customers stealing and being disrespectful.
good,"Long hours, standing the entire time except for breaks, extreme temps, heavy lifting, loud conveyers. There is an ergonomic pad to stand on at your station. There is a meeting at the beginning of the shift and after lunch called a ""standup"" ....they give safety tips and other announcements. Also, a 1 minute stretch routine. Management keeps track of how you manage your time at your station."
good,"Standing and walking on my feet for 10 hours was not something i expected to do, while working at amazon, by the end of the day my feet hurt so bad to walk, but I will never be a quitter. I kept going back to work until i felt no more pain."
good,The job was easy but you basically had to put items anywhere. They want you to have bin etiquette but it is basically impossible with all the items that are in the wrong spot. The breaks are too short and the 12 hour shifts are honestly horrible. You literally go to work and sleep no time for family and the management knows it.
good,"everyday coming in the morning and leaving at night, 12 hour shifts, i am lifting and placing totes in their labeled category"
good,The building has just reached a year and more to come. Definitely a handful of those with some really good energy. Get the building flowing and everyone with the right attitude of getting the job done things can be very productive.
good,A typical day at work is working towards targets and ensuring you provide the best customer experience. Working within evaluating various products to determine the customers feedback and needs on what they have ordered and whether or not the product can go back out to market. the role is enjoyable and has a lot of variety with a relaxed working environment.
good,Work hard and get your just reward.  Tough deadlines. Customer is the focus. Make money through increased profitability.  Frugal spending habits. Aggressive strategy.
good,It was always fun. Because they always prices for the competitions. Everyone was nice. Everyone is treated equaly. The managers where great
good,"Arrive at work take, your station, view your assignment, Management  would give a prep talk about the days work and what are production rates should be. Partner up with another co-worker to reach peak production. We have safety exercises throughout the day. The hardest part of the day is when our rates aren't met do to late trucks or improper loading of trucks. The most enjoyable part of the day is hitting rates and helping the company to achieve maximum rates for the day. I feel a sense of accomplishment that I have done my part when at work."
good,"Overall it's a fast paced working inviorment, you constantly pick and shrink wrap pallets. Great place if you have warehouse experiences."
good,"You get really tired for those 10 hours standing in your feet . "
good,I am to new to make an accurate review. So far everything seem to be ok. Not much to say further. The culture seem to be ok and the staff friendly
good,"great place to work, long hours can be tough but once you adjust its not too bad, the work is hard and the hours are long but co-workers are extremely friendly"
good,My coworkers were wonderful to work with. The managers were very helpful with whatever I needed help with and the company is wonderful.
good,I do not wish to share any personal experiences or conditions of the amazon warehouse work environment. I realize that accepting a warehouse position warrants warehouse work.
good,I scan all the boxes and it comes down the conveyer belt. We work together as a team.  We can be cross trained and work in other departments. You can take classes and there's always a chance to move up in Amazon. You can be promoted to being a leader.
good,"it was okay working there but a lot of favoritism so the ability to promotion you have to suck up to people, very tedious work but good benefits the pay taps out at 15.00 15.75 for nights"
good,Training is provided.You get to work with workers from different background and environment. A lot of new things to learn on sorting/scanning and this helps in increasing of job knowledge.
good,"A company that expects too much from its managers and as a result has a high turnover rate."
good,"hard conditions in the warehouse"
good,"A highly busy establishment that need to stay clear on the promises and incentives that's told, and give hour lunch breaks instead of 30 minutes, it's hard on people bodies to constantly stand and only have so much time to break but have to walk a distant to break, therefore it's really not a break."
good,"It was an alright job, least paid warehouse in the area with most ours worked. Did accommodate school schedule, even though it took a while for it to get approved. Lot of stressful and difficult work on a daily basis, but a lot of overtime provided."
good,Started off the day by strecthing.. Then we found out where we would at for the day and what floor we'd be working on. The hardest part of the job was being pretty much isolated from one another
good,"great place to work. good team players, regular breaks, shuttlebus service great, hours were good."
good,I enjoyed working for Amazon. The pay was good. VTO as a practice was not good. Integrity needed to fully explain their point system Do not tell people they have 40 points but let them go after 6 points.
good,its ok east enough  traveling was a hassle put it was worth it the workers was nice enough and easy to get along with i was a packer easiest gob there
good,"Amazon is a service and customer satisfaction oriented company. I had a great opportunity understanding the importance of customer service and satisfaction of the same. My colleagues were very friendly and helped me a lot especially during the transition from induction to OJT (on the job training) phase. Leads and Supervisors were very helpful, motivating and also provided me with great inputs and guidance during my entire period of employment at Amazon. Amazon had a great work culture and even at the toughest of the challenges during the job, there was adequate support by the leads which made my life easier at Amazon. The best part of Amazon is work culture and a great professional integrity."
good,"it was very fast paced. They move people around too much. About the time I got use to and doing well at a job function, I would get moved to another."
good,very busy shift all the time. quota should be met. left to work on my own after induction which worked well for me. the hardest part for me was to work 4 straight night shifts
good,"The hiring staff is very unfriendly, though business professional. The breaks are very short. Coworkers constantly trash talk the management and all of hr staff. HR is hardly ever available to answer questions and are lazy."
good,Not much needed to review this job. Basic seasonal work required working in both shipping and receiving. I did have problems with my first 2 checks being processed correctly. HR wasn't very helpful. You have to contact corporate.
good,"I liked working at Amazon, it's a pretty easy place too work as long as you take care of everything you need too, Amazon is a great company that can keep you comfortable."
good,"They just really need you as a body moving around the boxes and shipping for them. I understand that this is still a respected company and job but it is not for me. Typical day here was always the same, Move packages around and build pallets"
good,"not really a bad place to work, however the pay does not match how hard you will be working. they urge everyone to stay with the company if there temp but don't really offer good pay. plus the point system is annoying. However if you need so place to work just until you get something worth this is the place to be."
good,Working part time at Amazon is great. The shifts are fairly short but there is ample opportunity to pick up more hours. There are multiple shifts at various points throughout the day.
good,"fun place to work,great pay,lots of overtime,was able to work in different departments and learn new skills and travel  to other facilities to help out"
good,I would prefer not to comment unless I know that this is anonymous. I did not enjoy working here. The management themselves are perfectly fine but the agency I worked for was below par. It was unacceptable and many have the same feelings as myself.
good,"Amazon is a good company to work for however, if you have a problem handling stress and anxiety i don't think this job is for you as it is a fast paced environment with lots of expectations. Great pay and benefits though."
good,Warehouse work where you could learn as much as you are willing to do.   Fast pace days and you never get bored.  Other employees are willing to help out when needed and the job is never dull.
good,"Amazon taught me a lot about how hard jobs can be, especially warehouse jobs. But it taught me skills I can use at my next job. Working there was both positive and negative."
good,"Orari di inzio lavoro precisi"
good,"A typical day at work here is always crazy because they set new rules everyday. I have learned to just suck it up and go with what ever come my way for that day. Management has no clue of whats going on. they are some good and some bad coworkers as every job is going to have. But I'm a people person anyway so I'm not really bothered by anyone. The hardest part of my job is having no good direction and no routine at all, everything is so disorganized. The most enjoyable part is only when i get the opportunity to learn new things,"
good,I am a brilliant team worker and have experience working well with other people when playing in team 	for sport .this has also helped to develop good communication skills.I’am a fast learner and am happy to do any training needed for a job .I’am flexible to working long hours and different shifts
good,I learned more than packing and picking skills. the hardest part of the job is priority. I am a brilliant team worker and have experience working well with other people when playing in team 	for sport .this has also helped to develop good communication skills. I am a fast learner and am happy to do any training needed for a job .I’m flexible to working long hours and different shifts
good,"Usually stressful days at times, but does get better when coming up with strategies to make work easier."
good,"This is a great place to work if you are early in your career and don't need work/life balance.  If you are married, with kids, etc. ENTER AT YOUR RISK!"
good,"good and friendly environment, good benefits. training is efficient. multiple breaks in between shifts. safe and just an over all great place to work as long as you don't mind walking for pretty much 12 hours every day/night."
good,The management does not have a good since of time when employees are expected to be at work at a certain time but not don't start there route until 2 and a half hours later but rush you to finish your.
good,There is always something going on the the HR department supports the employees as much as possible.  The Holiday seasons are busy and we work long hours but there are constantly things going on within the building to boost morale and increase productivity.
good,"i didnt mind what i did at amazon,i was in the packing department,which basically i just packed the product in boxes and sent them down the conveyor.management could have been better,felt i didnt get a lot of interaction"
good,"I learned how to operate the reach truck, PR, PC, clamp and tugger after over a year of employment although I requested it constantly.  They constantly move you around to other departments that you are not very good in instead of cross training other employees so that there is a rotation instead of the same people always being sent elsewhere.  Favoritism was a major problem there."
good,A typical day at work you do get enough work to do and exercise. Any one who worked with me never complained about the work.
good,I had a very well learning experience and alot of trust within my team at ont2 warehouse. The high paced environment is a fast way of learning multiple new responsibilities.
good,"The training offered was unorganized making it hard to do the job and its requirements. I enjoyed the hard work and was always busy but was very confused as to how to do parts of my job or even where to go. I never met a manager or supervisor, just different trainers."
good,"If you don't like walking or standing still for a whole shift, 10 hours, avoid amazon. Yes it might help you get in shape, but it's killer on your joints and your sanity may or may not be at risk depending on your department."
good,"always busy very loud, good pay, can move up in department if you work hard, can also switch departments when a opening is available, It is a very good company to work for!"
good,Not much to say about it. You definitely work hard and in the work environment you can be alone. The people i encountered always seemed to be nice. The only problem was my job was secluded from other people
good,"Loved management, but not much upward mobility here. Great job for someone just looking for something temporary. The company does a lot of outsourcing, which is not good for anyone looking for full time opportunities."
good,"good place to work, nice associates, wish they paid more. Lot of of walking and exercise. 10 hours 4 days a week is great. Hardest part is the heat"
good,"Fair and suitable place to work, peers are really friendly. First faced working environment. Sometimes they provide food in the break room, which is really nice."
good,"I'm a good collaborator and amina said to do everything correct, talkative always at work , l love to be as correctly as gest no love and tin with justice always"
good,A typical day at work would consist of receiving a scanner and going and finding the customers items then putting them on a trailer to ship. The most enjoyable part of the job was the music that they played
good,there is its pros and its cons the customer service expectation is awesome and there is plenty of room for growth within the company
good,managers had no clue how to run the place.they would not listen to the people that knew what was going on.most of the coworkers were fun to work with.the hardest part of the job was trying to make the rate that they set way to high.
good,"Its a photo job but not very creative, but the money can be alright if you really need work immediately. High production required along with High pressure."
good,"That was my first job in delivery  logistics. I don't know how to do that. But they gave training to do so. Management was very good there. Staff was very supportive  helping  me out every situation. "
good,okay job to have all the co workers got a lot there always  happy to hear if you want to learn more. they give out prizes during month of December. but this company has great benefits
good,"what am i learn about amazon, do follow the order to package that people wanted and do many thing help to find what missing and pack  boxes to cover and wrap it.. it fun to do that but one thing i hate do wrap big things i enjoy more than everything what i though about this place"
good,for money its good but its hard to work with amazon because they have productivity system and it can't be my future. Can't work with amazon more than two years.
good,"Work week would be four ten hour work days with four days off. During peak season, work would start earlier and with mandatory OT days. Work-life balance is very challenging. Physically demanding, may walk up to five miles a day depending on your pace. Work with a variety of interesting people. Managers are willing to help you and work with problems. Breaks would often be to short, and with way to many people in the break rooms. Overall job is consistent, yet repetitive."
good,"Be prepared to be on your feet 10 hours a day"
good,The job is very demanding but it's hours. Starting early and getting off late. It does get frustrating with the package count and finding businesses. Overall the job is consistent.
good,"My team within the team was what made working at Amazon palpable.  The pay is great especially with all the over time that would be required, however.....  The overtime will take you away from your family if you have one, if you are a family person.  Amazon is a corporation, if you are unwilling to work they will ship you out and a new one in.  There is no personal attachment there, only with the people you call a team."
good,"Morning stretches are always a must because of all the walking and standing you will do through out the day. You will then start receiving orders on the scanners that you have to get, scan the item the place in the bin."
good,"very busy helping out lots of happy customers.learn different types of jobs when needed.management is disorganized and coworkers are friendly.hardest part of job is standing in one place most of the day. making customers happy is exciting,\."
good,"I learned to have more patience and to go with the flow of each day."
good,worked when everyone I know had the day off. Had music playing all night long.the job was easy.communication was really good.
good,"Nice environment, okay people and lots of benefits. Have to meet those deadlines depending upon what department you're working in. A lot of walking so plan your daily break routine ahead of time."
good,"Overall decent review, I worked overnights during peak season. 5 10 hours shifts was rough. As a Dock member there was minimal supervision but the job got boring quick. Great seasonal place to work and make money for the holidays if you don't already have a job."
good,"10 hours spent on your feet all day and constantly moving across an incredibly large three level warehouse describes a normal day.  Half of my coworkers did not want to be there and their lack of motivation or sense of doing things correctly ultimately made the job far more difficult to accomplish.  Management seems only to care about the numbers, nothing else.  Since speed of work is everything you better hope you don't run into a problem (there were always problems) since resolving it means you need to walk to a specific station and you also need to hope you aren't 5th in line."
good,"Gostei de trabalhar, ambiente muito bom e pessoas maravilhosas."
good,It was a cool job. Explored the city. Found a couple dope places to eat & shop. Not bad at all. The pay is also good. It's only about 6 hrs max but you get plenty of tips so it makes up for it.
good,"It really depends on which building you work in. They have excellent benefits, HR is AMAZING and will bend over backwards for you but it's all about favoritism, feeling objectified non stop and it seems management could care less about quality and it's all about numbers or quantity."
good,Making sure you reach your quota everyday and getting at your job everyday was the challenge. Great place to work if your great with your hands and active.
good,"I was an associate through a temp agency and so I was given a different experience than those who were hired directly. This makes a big difference, because I was given the same tasks as an Amazonian but had a tenth of the benefits. That wasn't a problem until i began to notice how the managers from Amazon lacked leadership skills as well as respect for the associates who worked through the temp agency Integrity Staffing Solutions."
good,"Amazon MDW2 in Joliet, is a bottom line company make rate or you are out! One shouldn't be held accountable for what comes down their conveyor belt. If you open a box with over a hundred pieces and continue to rate will soar, if not and rate isn't met for the week, you will be written up and that's just protocol, they can't even explain how to better it either, because it all depends on what you pick up."
good,"Uma excelente empresa."
good,A day of an Amazon associate is frustrating due to the fact that management can really make some poor decisions. its fast paced and most ppl are cool.
good,"long hours, management not good, human resources unsure of own policies, poor equipment, no support from managers, dangerous parking area, lack of security"
good,The job is not so stressful. The supervisor in that company is cooperative and provides help and good direction to employees. If you work there you can gain good experience and you can also add it in your future resume.
good,Its a good paying job but does put a lot of strain on your body. allows opportunity and workplace advancement. The long term benefits are a plus as well.
good,"lab126 is a very unequal organization in terms of roles and responsibilities, and subsequent compensation. all companies to an extent have this quality, but i found my experience here to be amplified, due to the nature of operation, and corporate culture."
good,"Have acquired problem solving skills and pit operato experience. Busy faced paced environment where you are constantly moving lifting, bending, standing and working hard"
good,"Amazon has a bad reputation. It is truly not a horrible place to work from my experience there. Amazon hires you to work, and they expect nothing less from you. A minute late is a minute late, and it is not acceptable to them. They will get on you for the littlest things, but its only because you are held to the highest standard. I have to say I do not enjoy going to work in the morning, but not because it is a terrible place, but because it is physically demanding everyday."
good,"a typical day at work was usually busy, grading and packing, this job was great benefits and great pay, this job gives you the chance to meet new people"
good,"Physically demanding high energy workplace with quick turnover of employees. Great for the few who can thrive in such an environment, but wearing for those who can't."
good,It was a challenge but there were positive aspects of working with Amazon namely the managers were very accomodating and motivating.
good,"Stood all shift"
good,great place to work get paid and unpaid time off and vacation paid time as well you work around different people the management is very nice
good,"Managers were nice and created a safe work environment"
good,"A day working for Amazon through Integrity Staffing Solutions is a fast paced and robotic work day. There is little to no interaction between other workers, which allows you to focus on your goal time and item count."
good,The work/life balance was not there. Always had to clean up after day shift making the work load worse. Most enjoyable part was growing with the associates from the very first day of launch.
good,"This company is good if you already have a degree and/or pushing towards one. However they have a good way of making you stay by bringing up promotion, but never really give you the opportunity to learn and grow with the company."
good,All in all like the work and coworkers in my department. Management takes favorites and treats employees unequally. Also unfair promotion opportunities.
good,"A typical day starts off with stretching, hearing whatever safety tips managers have for you, then heading to your station. I am placed on AFE Chute which is packing customer orders. Been here for about a month and all I can say is, don't slack off and make sure to make rates  or they'll send you down to the docks where you'll load boxes on the hot trailers or AFE 1 which is downstairs- super hot and kinda dark. I've never been so grateful to be working side by side with great people. They've all been so patient and helpful with me since day one. To newcomers, it takes a while to know where all boxes are stored and what boxes are needed to inform the water spider.  Just ask the person next to you, they'll gladly help. "
good,"The week begins with a morning meeting to get everyone on the same page. Bulletin boards with meeting info. Everyone knows what is expected for that week, and does it. I usually work in the production studio. Management is on set or in studio; if gone, employees are aware. Daily/Weekly jobs are issued. Co-workers range from quiet to loud personalities, those with control issues, etc. The hardest part of the job is when there isn't enough work to keep everyone busy. Work week is Monday through Friday, 8:30 am to 4:30 pm...perfection. They also organize creative community service projects. There exist a feel of family, with its share of drama for spice."
good,"Professional, laid back, Great environment. Can be hectic when trying to walk. Great benefits. Awesome staff. Overall a good place of employment."
good,Depending on your actually assignment the jobs aren't very difficult and the pay is decent but I did work through a temporary company so the job didn't last that long.
good,Okay but  not suitable for everyone. Good summer part time job for college students or anyone that wants to make a little extra income.
good,"Typically it was busy. There were times when there was not enough work for the employees so they would be given a different task to work on, like cleaning and whatnot. Co-workers were great. I enjoyed most of the people working there."
good,"large company, well known, good pay, hard commute and extended work hours. ever changing evaluations and standards of rating. black out periods of vacation, work as a number not as a person"
good,Für die Arbeit die man dort machen muss stimmt das Verdienstverhältnis
good,"Working the hours all you have time for is sleep and work the whole work week, pto,upt and vacation are nice, they most of the time you will be moved from your department because they have to many people even if you get there before the other people, it takes time for them to work with you, with a overwhelming turn over rate, 7/40 may stay"
good,"Upon arrival, all team members attend briefing led by Managers to receive feedback and give suggestions to any problems that raised the previous day. Once the meeting is other we then go to our delegated roles. From time to time I would train new colleagues on health and safety handling and procedures."
good,"The actual job is easy but it is very physically demanding therefore it is a very tiring job. By the time you get home you just want to sleep. It is a 10 hour shift which makes it worse, maybe if it was an 8 hour shift it would make it less stressful. By the end of the day everyone is cranky and drained. Managers come and go so any time you get comfortable with your manager they will either get fired or get moved to different shift,  building etc."
good,constantly doing something. able to communicate with others and have a relaxing environment filled with people who are there to get the work done and make friends.
good,I feel like the company its self is a great company to work for but certain jobs within the company are not so great. My days are usually very long and draining. I wouldn't recommend working there if you have a problem with very repetitive tasks.
good,Working at Amazon Fulfillment is a good place to work if you want a full week of work in a short period of time. I would say it's hard on your feet unless you wear really good shoes. The co-workers are not bad. They need to work on management and work on a better way of communicating information about the work days.
good,it was a good experience I wouldn't work there again kind of unfair management but it was easy everyone learned to drive a order picker
good,"Stress is what a typical day is made of, but you will learn a lot since you are in competition with everyone. The management is not that bad, the co-workers are always awesome."
good,Tough place to work. Standing on feet 12 hrs a day. High volume out put. A lot of pressure to meet quota. Hardest part of job is standing on feet all day.
good,High paced work environment with achievable goals. Multiple opportunities for overtime during peak. Variety of coworkers with various backgrounds.
good,"Good Hours"
good,In the working environment I gained experience in handling the barcode laser scanner gun and working under fast pace during peak times.
good,A typical day for is coming to work and saying hello to my fellow associates. I get the night started by doing stretches and getting the blood flowing. I go to my work station and log into my computer by scanning my badge. I make sure my area is free of debris(safety first). Then i start receiving. There's not really a hard part to my night. I make it as easy as possible not just for myself but for others as well. My co-workers are friendly and respectful of others. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping others.
good,"Pretty easy job with unrealistic rates. Typical day starts out with stretches, a morning meeting, and then a fight to get a charged order picker truck, check it for safety, grab a cage and drive slowly to your first pick, all within 8-10 minutes while trying to avoid other drivers so that you won't get coached and even then you have to hope that the coaches don't talk too long or you will get coached for being off task. When it comes to breaks you do not have 15 minutes, you have 10 and even less than that if you want to see sunlight within your 10 hours of captivity. Lunches are 30 minutes, then you have another meeting and off to the races again. Starting out they make you learn to drive forklifts even if you are uncomfortable, and there is always new hires that help you slow down your rate to get into more trouble, but after a few accidents you will get used to it. If you have any health problems it's automatically your fault. The hardest part of the job is having to mimic a robot, the most enjoyable is you get to see many different people, even though you get in trouble for socializing. The coworkers can range from extremely polite to terribly rude depending on how long they have been there. Management are basically puppets that answer questions with ""generally asked questions"" answers and everything is your own fault."
good,"Environment is decent, But It is a Lot of hard and demanding work for not enough pay to match the amount of required work, time of in next to non-existent."
good,"While working the job at Amazon was pretty good, my issues with working there came from the staffing agency that I got hired through. While I work at an Amazon warehouse I am hired, trained fired or disciplined through the staffing agency. But, Integrity and Amazon management don't like to communicate with each other when it comes to documentation. Was suspended because Amazon never received my diploma from the staffing agency and took two days and a lot of attitude before they admitted the error was on their end. Luckily those two days were days I didn't work anyway so there was no loss in paycheck. "
good,"A typical day at work goes as follows I would get there clock in look at the board to see where I have to stow or stock shelves for Amazon's clients, and then I go to the location and get limbered up and ready for work.  After that grab a scanner, and then a cart and start putting things on shelves.  What I learned was how to read a scanner, how to properly put items on shelves and how to use my time wisely, because there is a rate on how many items to be put on the shelves.  To me the management was pretty good they listened to me, and treating me with respect but not everybody like them.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with rate that I mentioned before, if you didn't fulfill the rate you were going to be coached, meaning while you were being talked to you still were expected to make rate.  What made this even worse is when there was no room on the shelves.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to not have to stow or stock the shelves was called water spidering meaning getting the items ready to be put on the shelves."
good,Normally working day is ten and a half hours.  There are two types of shifts: day shift (08:00 - 18:30) and night shift (19:00 - 05:30). I have gained great experience whilst working In Amazon. Management is often changing and mostly from outside which means lack of knowledge and understanding from inside of the business. But the minor part of management that have grown with the company through years are respected greatly. People who joins Amazon are very different. And it is crucial that each and one of them learns to work within team and independently. The hardest part of the job is nights and long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowledge that you have put that something into to fulfill customers promise
good,This company is for you to get your money at the time it is presented to you. its hard work and hardly no rest time with managers always on your back.
good,"busy at all times, hardest part was finding picked items that were missing or misplaced, the most enjoyable part of the job was that I stayed busy, 12 hour shifts"
good,Offered many hours with decent pay. Was good with procedure. Very active environment. Potential was shown and opprotunities to grow was always on the table
good,Amazon needs to think more about its employee culture and managers here should be a little more concerned about employee careers.
good,The company is slowing going the way of yesterday's performer. I would hesitate to work there giving the ongoing expectations of future layoffs at that corporation.
good,"I would not suggest anyone work there. My time there has not felt productive. Also I have not been able to put my degree to go use, and I feel that for some associates there are no opportunities for advancement.  Dead end.."
good,The money was good. Management wasn't good not a good place with advancement. No one there want to see you do better. It was time for me to go.
good,"Fast pace job, change every day, but I have learn alot working there. Learning several different processes during my time at amazon."
good,The HR department is very unresponsive and very difficult to comtact outside of wortk. They never called me back so I could explain my situation. Then sent me a form email sayin I was terminated.
good,"things change all the time, some of the customers were horrible and advancement was not readily available to all assoicates"
good,"Very fun job to have a first, but once you get to become familiar with daily OP's the job gets boring really fast. Most importantly pay rate isn't very adequate with daily job tasks."
good,"Nothing to say about any cons, and pros it has normal."
good,Amazon is place to be to work every person who wants develop his/her career. you can learn many things. its every day learning and making history
good,"A typical day at Amazon is coming in by at least 7AM and having to sign in the moment your shift starts. The time-clocks are packed at 6:55 because everybody's waiting to clock in. Its the same when you get off. After exercising for at least 30 mins, you start your shift. You are praying for breaks so you can at least sit down and if you don't have lunch, then your drained by the time you get off. The co-workers are nice and I've made some friends, but since it was temporary, we haven't been in touch since."
good,Long day standing in one spot doing the same thing all day. Time goes very slow. Lunch is the only thing that gets you through the day.
good,"It was an informal place with mostly a young group of associates ."
good,"I enjoyed working with amazon, there was always a job to day and the day went in a lot faster when we were working."
good,"Great place to learn."
good,"It's nice place to work, someone always there to help you if you need help.It would be better if some of the manager were nice."
good,"Amazon is an okay place to work. if your willing to workt out almost close to 12hrs a day. the pay is great, and the benefits are good too. but its easy to be replaced if you make a mistake. they are very strict about how everything is ran. but they are willing to work with you in your time of need. also, pay attention to your time off. they are also strict about that and will let you go if you go over your time off that they allowed for you to have. good luck."
good,Great Place to get started really fast paced you will be put to the test and there are people to help you along the way such as management and other co-workers with you.
good,"Horrible communications skills. And high turn over rate with employees and management. Not enough professionalism, it's more like high school."
good,"wouldn't mind going back. good pay. good hours. I enjoyed working there. nice people good environment. long days but once you get use to it, it becomes easy"
good,There are things to a warehouse that almost no one likes but at the end of the day we get the job done. Long hours and sometimes hot in the building we are just one building out of hundreds.
good,Answering calls & helping customers with various issues. Co-workers are always respectable. Had some issues with pay roll. Management does what they can when issues arise.
good,"I rated 3 because you can earn good money, but you'll have to give up your time with family to do so. "
good,"Job atmosphere is very similar to that of a high school. A lot of immature young adults that barely work. Also, attendance is based off a point system so there is no days to request off."
good,"-Would receive and problem solve the items that would come into the building. "
good,"An Amazonian's experience varies greatly depending on the business--and there are many, many businesses within Amazon. It also varies greatly depending on the manager; while at Amazon, I've had the best manager in my 20-year career, as well as the worst manager."
good,Amazon is hard place to work at its a place of favoritism. it a place to get an warehouse experience. Really hard to move onto different position. Long 10 to 12 hr shifts.
good,This is a different building but most of the same stuff. Only thing I didnt like about MKE5 Is that its part time and you only got 3-5 hours a day n like 20 a week....
good,"worked on assembly line, fast paced environment, co-workers are all good friendly people, managers don't always treat employees with respect and there is not much room for advancement."
good,Company will contradict their stance on job promotion stance.  It is for that reason that I rate  them as having a poor job security/advancement.  The work/life balance it good and so is the job culture.  The compensation for the work is pretty good as well.  Management gets a poor rating for the fact that they are dishonest and not transparent.
good,"Cool company to work for , alot of positions where you can move up in the company. The company have great team work and leadership skills."
good,This is a fast paced job. The staff works together in order to get the customer order out. The company has very great benefits and way that you can advance in the company.
good,the work here sometimes requires the person to walk for several hours and need to make rate. at the end of the day you need a rest.
good,"my time at amazon warehouse was very good, I enjoyed every minute of it. The work kept me going and made me feel good. The team at amazon were fantastic and helped me through it all, they give you good support."
good,"It's tiring sometimes because it's a physical job,but I like the people I work with,sometimes we have too much fun.The HR people are very good,they are very helpful and friendly.The managers are really respectfull"
good,This job taught me how to efficiently meet goals at a fast and challenging pace. My co-workers were very nice to work and talk with.
good,"This is a company is great or not so, completely dependent on you. If you have needs outside of your job, like caring for family, this is not a great place due to a lack of work/life balance. IF you are not dedicated to caring for another, it is a great company with huge benefits. "
good,"The lower management seem not to care about the employees just their own daily productivity goals. i loved working for amazon my first couple of months there. however, during the little under two years i was there management had a high turn over rate.."
good,very hard on the body and they are not understanding of work and life balance was hurt on the job and they did everything they could not to pay workers comp.
good,Not much changes between day to day but management isn't very concerned with fixing any problems or barriers that you have.
good,"everyone that i have worked with their has been easy to get along with and enjoyable to work with. A typical day can be demanding with time and product volume always a factor and the job is extremely physical. You will stand or walk 90% of the day, but everyone does their best to make it fun."
good,Fun culture. Learned how to be efficient. Working nights and weekends left little room for fun and or family time. Management was more of the friendly type and I felt little was done when it came to complaints.
good,"A job at amazon is good for students but with current Management and HR departments, jobs are extremely fragile and don't expect any type of promotion without a degree in hand despite the time you put in. Most Managers and HR department Personnel are right out of college with no experience and do a very poor job."
good,the best part about the job there is the people they can keep it fun but other then that its a pretty hard job. was a good place to work and is crazy in the holiday season.
good,family oriented environment with caring individuals who will go out of their way to assist.  I would work for this company again.
good,"Amazon.com was a great company to work for. In order to keep your job you basically have to be very fast in shipping out the orders. I worked there for the christmas season and was very demanding job. They keep track of the orders your shipping out and if your not meeting the quota, one of the managers will come and give you ideas on how you can do the order more quickly."
good,"Good place to work in my opinion, if you like a very fast paced job this is a great one to have! all you have to do is meet your daily rate and you will be successful in the job."
good,"Multi tasking is a must, face paced environment, and highly evolving. Change is constant and must be able to deal with anything at last minute's notice."
good,You don't know where you will be working during a typical 10 hours (especially if you know how to perform duties in different areas).
good,Amazon is a fact paced workplace your on your feet the entire day and it can be very stressful and tiring.  Not my most enjoyable job but the pay was good and the benefits were great.  Overall they make is difficult for you to move up but if you can it's great.
good,fast pace constantly moving for 10-12 hours a night employees are treated like garbage and you are not paid enough for the amount of work they expect from you.
good,"Amazon de Montélimar mélange culture d'entreprise atypique et joviale, a une pression psychologique difficile a supporter."
good,It was a good experience to be a part of amazon's working  environment.Looking forward to be a part of a company which can help me to develop into a good personality in future.
good,"A typical type of day at work would be producing 20,000 books for ordering customers. Management strives to hit goals of 40 books per person per hour which is the hardest part when there is no work coming from the printers that need to be serviced. Most enjoyable part is the process of the bookmaking itself."
good,"This is a warehouse job, so just keep in mind that this is a very active job. The pay was pretty decent, and was not bad. Personally for me, it was just too repetitive."
good,Long 10 hour days with little break times due to the size of the building it was difficult making it to the break rooms. I learned how to manage a team of my own and delegate task to complete daily or weekly assignments.
good,I work as an inbound dock worker. Runs smoothly. Nice environment. Made a lot of new friends. Got trained on forklift and cherry picker.
good,"coworkers are cool, but management only cares about numbers."
good,"Its good,its ok, but its  my 1st job, so no commitment about it, because on that time of recession and they provide me job with less salary but so much thankful they provide me job, I know there is long working hour but I am happy there."
good,Peaceful at times and you get to be left alone which makes it easier on you since you don't get any pressure. Becoming an instructor is also quite a quick process.
good,"typical day at work is just counting the inventory and what I've learned is that in order for to advance in the company you have to be buddy buddy with the mangers, and the managers don't know how to treat people as well as talk to them, my co-workers some do there job and there are some that are just lazy and don't do there job.  The only  hard part about this job is advancing.   there is nothing enjoyable about working for Amazon.."
good,"Every day you try to learn something new in the company, and once you become good enough at the said position you usually end up training others in that same position. The managers could be better but usually hold you to a reasonable quota and help when they can."
good,Although this is a wonderful place to work meeting great people. I felt as though I could not advance anymore due to management being preoccupied with other thing and favoritism.  benefits are good and its not stressful trying to request off.
good,I would not recommend this company to anyone. It's all work no play there is constant turnover and management does not care about employee needs
good,"Amazon my seen like a an wonderful job to work for but unfortunately it is not. For the past 6 months management were very involved with the workers until the company decided to change the management team. This new management system they have now, I must say is horrible because they are writing associates up for anything. For example, an associate was waiting on work but the manager stated the associate was off task for 40 minutes and the associate received an final written for waiting on work. I must say peak season is the best place to work for this company because during peak you work 50-66 hours along with overtime."
good,"working at amazon was a good learning experience for me, i deleverd packages to customers, packed packages and stocked the warehouse"
good,Ambiente di lavoro favorevole. Il mio lavoro quotidiano consiste nell'effettuare verifiche sui prodotti presenti a magazzino al fine di garantire al cliente l'acquisto ordinato sul sito
good,"Working for Amazon was okay except for the long hours and travel time, Amazon is a fast pace environment and you spend all day on you're feet"
good,Due to the fact that almost all work was based on a rate system that calculates the amount of units per hour picked there were constant new employees not able to make rate which caused many coming in and out of the warehouse each day. When this would happen it would cause a lot of new day training every day.
good,Fun and friendly environment. Equall oppertunities for all. Fast paced job. High energy everyday. Laid back vibe and nice pay.
good,"Miles of walking, bending, loading."
good,"Unique culture and lot of learning, you get to learn a lot while perform your daily duties and get to interact with various different teams."
good,"At Amazon you work a very physical ten hour shift, four days a week. You stay at your station and do a very repetitious job for the majority of your day. At certain points of the day management will ask you to participate in power hours which ask you to go as fast as you can for that hour to help them meet their required numbers, which usually result in some reward like one vendor buck(a dollar that can only be used in a vending machine). The workers are usually friendly and hard working, most of them have less then two years with the company. The physical toll that the job takes with the lack of reward and recondition for that hard work leads to many leaving the company. Amazon hires most of their entry level management straight out college, so most of the managers are unable to do the jobs that their associates do on a regular basis."
good,start off wih standup and then onto your stsation for 2 plus hpurs then brea for 15 bac to wor for two more plus hours and then lunch repeat first par of the day
good,My job i worked in universal in outbound my job was to scan items i had to scan 167 items a hours in order to meet my number.i work 10 hour shift standing in one spot
good,"Its a nice company to work with. The work culture is good . You can learn different things and upskill."
good,"A typical day at work required me to scan and organize packages before taking a van to either Brooklyn or Manhattan to deliver either fresh food or mail order packages. Hardest part of the job was just about everything involved in it, definitely the toughest job I've ever had. Juggling driving in NY with timely deliveries is not an easy task."
good,"A day starts with a review of e-mails to keep up on emerging issues and relaying those emerging issues to associates, ensuring they've been properly escalated, and then diving into whatever other existing work you have. That work will be interrupted by customer escalations that you may or may not need to take depending on how well the associate bringing the contact to you has been working with the customer so far. Different managers and leads have different expectations of what kind of de-escalation skills associates should have, what concessions are acceptable, and how to ensure the best results for the customers. Transparency is a must."
good,bad workplace the hardest part of the job was that they were bossy and really didn't care about employee safety they were very well mannered and would criticise other employees
good,"hours undependable,  very diverse. good for some one looking for part time work.   3 different shifts.  great for folks who need a second job."
good,All I did was put things in a boxes. It was every loud in there. I did not like it their. They did not care about the employees because it was so loud and not organized. Each team lead did not know what to do when the next team lead come in.
good,Amazon teaches you to focus and stay on task because it involves a lot of repetitive work that can cause you to lose focus easily. It is a fast paced environment which helps to learn how to work under pressure. Managers were constantly supporting and motivating all the workers during each shift. All workers that I encountered were pleasant and tried to help the new people become used to the environment. Maintaining the appropriate rates was a challenge due to many variables on any given day. Interaction with great co-workers was the most enjoyable part of Amazon.
good,"i learned how to use the pallet jack, receive incoming shipments, management is learning along with regular employees, love watching the robots work"
good,A typical day starts at 6am and ends at 3pm.It was always fun to work in amazon.it requires a lot dedication and hard work .Management was pretty good.We used to get good pay.
good,I do not feel comfortable providing a review for this job. What i will say is that the job is fast paced and can be a very fun environment. Professionalism is something that is lacked but overall it is a good job.
good,"The work can be mind numbing, but there is plenty of room to grow. Management is awesome and super helpful, as long as you attempt to make rate."
good,"si inizia con la riunione mattutina, in seguito tramite lo scanner in dotazione si selezionano i prodotti che vengono acquistati ogni giorno dal sito amazon.de"
good,"Never a dull moment, managers always on your back trying to their own. The amount of work given to the drivers is unrealistic with no breaks."
good,"A typical day at work was staying productive unloading trailers on PIT equipment, minor training for new associates, and being in a ""lead"" position. I learned a lot about ""general warehouse activities"" loading and unloading product, packaging products, storing products properly. Our management could have used some work, a lot of fresh ""out of school"" managers that didn't fully understand the process in their work environment. My co-workers were amazing very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was the hours (overnight). The most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with, they became a second family to me."
good,Very simple job and managers. Just do your job properly and no one gonna bother you. Perfect place for people who don't like to be disturbed by other people. Managers there are very polite and thankful.
good,This is a good and challenging place to work. But some projects are too micro-managed by higher level managers. Projects' ownership is sometimes hard to determine due to some people policy.
good,The pay is good for what is expected of you. Management is unorganized when work picks up and during late November into December for the holidays. No real position advancement. Very good benefits. Shift is 10 hours long at 4 days a week.
good,"orari altalenanti,frenetica . arrivo in azienda timbratura beng arrivo postazione 5 ore di preparazione ordini pausa ripresa postazione fine lavoro tecniche di confezionamento,controllo qualità,sveltezza,controllo fatture,controllo pc colleghi sempre di corsa poco spazio per interagire. parte difficile controllo di tutto e sveltezza, confezionare"
good,"No skills required.  Physical taxing.  10 hour work days.  Overtime required peak season 11 hour days (5 days/weekly)"
good,work 10 hours a day with half an hour dinner break and two 15 minutes break. Worked Wednesday to Saturday. Co- workers were great with one another
good,"A typical day at work would be inconsistent work being provided for us some nights through out the work days which would lead to some people becoming ""Time Off Task"" because they're struggling to find work on one level."
good,Schell Laufen mit wagen und Picken die artikel mit scanner und vertig machen fur versand
good,"The most enjoyable part of amazon was training new associates. I went to California to train inbound associates for the new FC ."
good,"A typical day at amazon would be arriving and clocking in, finding a station, and starting your work as soon as possible. They allow two 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch. The walk to your break areas are definitely confined to at least 10 minutes. Most people there are nice and wonderful; however, some of the leaders are not what you expect to be. The best part of the job would have to be, for me, the income. The worst part is asking questions to learn and being told that they don't know."
good,"The job is good, but the team lead don't give us direction. and we have no idea what we going to do and we wait for department manager for help."
good,"the work is not hard, but you need to stay focused because it is tedious. good work environment and the security is 2nd to none."
good,Have to be able to stand for 10 hours in one area. People are very close together and you have to maintain a certain speed thoughout the day.
good,"busy call centre"
good,"Very fast paced, constantly moving around & always busy. If you work a night shift you have little to no day life. Work is tough and makes you wanna just sleep all day when you are off."
good,"My position was only seasonal, but if you're not used to working 10 hour shifts, this job isn't for you. You get great hours and the pay is good, but it is very tiring throughout the day. Only an half hour lunch with two 15 minute breaks, lots of walkingand a high rate that keeps you under pressure. If this is you're first job in a while, do NOT apply unless necessary, especially if you're a parent of young children. Mandatory overtime is also a regular during the holiday shopping season, making you lose moreof your reuperation time betweeen the long work hours."
good,"Really good if you're in need of money, but I'll prefer to starve than go back in there again. At least they rent a bus to take you from your house if you're living far."
good,Amazon is okay for a salary but as far as being a good workplace no it sucks they have no concern for their employees. They need to place more time for lunch in their schedule. Very poor air quality in the building
good,typical day at work was good. Management was okay. Co workers were good and worked well as part of a team. Late hours were hard. Satisfying customer's needs was fun.
good,"I liked this company, the only reason why I left was due to a medical reason. But I will try to return as soon as I am able to. They value their employees"
good,"Learned RF scanner system and data entry very fast paced, very educational, hardest part of my day was doing the same thing everyday, would love to learn new things frequently."
good,The hardest part of my job is dealing with different attitudes. A typical day goes by pretty smooth despite the attitudes. Management can be okay but once again the attitudes. I LOVE my co-workers.
good,They aren't really a great company to work for on the entry level. Work is made hard on purpose to the point where lots of people cant meet the work standard.
good,Stimulating work with great collogues. Giving ability to growth and develop. The most enjoyable part was negotiating prices with customers and travelling to promote company's products.  There was a lot of different things to do so I never got bored with the job. Everything was challenging and  fun.
good,It's a very physical job but it's a fun place to work at. Amazon has a lot of incentives for their employees to promote. I would highly recommend Amazon to any family members or friends.
good,"Amazon est un lieu agréable pour travailler, les managers font ce qu'il faut pour que le salarié se sente bien dans l'entreprise."
good,"Pack items that customers ordered online and get them ready to be shipped out to them. Scanned the items, boxed them up and put a sticker on it."
good,"There were times in which I got lost in the warehouse. No one really comes and checks on you, (granted they shouldn't have to) however, in a warehouse it gets hot. "
good,"Typical day at work in an FC is not easy, you have to speed walk everywhere, lift heavy items sometimes you need a co worker to help you. Everything must be done in less than 7 minutes. Sometimes when it's really busy the managers help. Managers are nice and they listen to employee's wants/needs. Since everyone is part-time you only get a 15 minute break. The pay is great but the hours suck"
good,"it's a temporary job for the holidays, looking for something more permanent & stable. I've been there for over 2 years, I left & came back. I do enjoy the work that I do however, with the hiring freeze, I rather have something more stable & a better opportunity to work my way up."
good,"Bonne ambiance de travail avec des collègues compétents."
good,"If you say your going to do something as a manger for a company,I think it should be honored. And do as you say you're going to do."
good,Overly dramatized daily work schedule changes. Warehouses should be more organized. The starting wage could be higher.
good,"Fun place to work.Good job security. Fun environment. Nice co-workers. Ok life balance. Very diverse job culture. Benefits is ok, as well as compensation. Some managers is cool."
good,Easy to get job but standing and walking for 10 hours per day 4 days of week is torture on your feet. Your feet will begin to burn and sting after 3 hours. This company should talk about this up front before people are hired.
good,"I work at nights 7pm-5:30 AM Weds-Sat at the new Dallas location (FTW1). I started when it first opened. I started on Prep and moved to a Problem Solver. "
good,IT Can be a good company to work for if you know the right people. i love working here. and i like the work my coworkers are cool manager ok
good,"I was order picker, packer and quality controller in this company. Even though I enjoyed working in Amazon I could not persevere my job because I was a temporary worker in there."
good,My primary responsibilities were to scan and pack orders while making sure that every issue or damaged item was taken care of appropriately. I also helped people around me with anything they needed.
good,"it just did stress you out when you didn't hit you're targets and people was cherry picking, but the staff where pleasant and polite"

good,To Contact sellers about the issues that are being fcaed by customers which have been reported to customer support and routed to seller support.
good,"The hardest part of this job is the overnight hours."
good,Very little appreciation for efforts taken by indviduals. Fluctuating management policies. Low impetus for employee growth.
good,"Good pay and friendly workplace, but high stress and extremely highly monitored, no room for error whatsoever and everything you do and say will be analysed. Not for the faint hearted, but very rewarding if you enjoy giving good customer service."
good,"Not a place to build a career.  Depending on the nature of your job, it could be very monotonous in nature and with little work-life balance."
good,"A empresa possui bastante experiência de mercado, incentiva bastante com benefícios, investe no seu colaborador. Criou metodologias diferentes para motivar a equipe, mesmo em momentos de crise. A direção, no entanto, falha na postura ao se direcionar, nas relações interpessoais, como por exemplo, não sabe escolher a forma adequada de chamar a atenção do seu colaborador e não consegue se programar com antecedência os eventos necessários a longo prazo."
good,It was a hard pace working job. You will work hard every minute you have at work. I was schedule to work 9 hours every day and it was just a hard job
good,Each day presented unique opportunities to innovate and solve consumer oriented needs.This is a great company to learn from.
good,"Fast-paced; rapidly changing; cut-throat; work hard.... and come back tomorrow and do it again! I loved saying that I was going to go work at the best tech company out there, but the team I was on was brutal and management did not care. There is not enough time in the day to do your job or complain about a single thing."
good,"for the most part is a friendly place to work. I like to move around a lot so this job is perfect for that. the one thing that I find a little unfair is that when you're a temp they start you off at so much an hour, then they do direct hires through amazon. so those direct hires make more and become full Amazon before people who have been there for months."
good,I loved working at amazon it was a great place it helped me get certified in warehouse work but i didn't care for the management
good,Amazon is a good place to work even though it is very strenuous on your body. Will teach you self dedication and hard work. Up to you to continue on a daily basis.
good,"typical day would consider either picking orders on the floor, or upon PIT equipment. I have learned many job functions while being at amazon, such as seasonal ambassador, part time problem solve, inbound/outbound pick and pack etc. I get along with most of the co-workers that i work with, never had any major issues. I would say the hardest part of my job is trying to keep up with rates. the most enjoyable part of my job is getting the satisfaction of having a job that i can support my family and be able to come home at the end of the day."
good,Ive spent many years working for this company. The goal has been and always will be customer obsession. This same customer obsession molded my everyday working mentality to strive for absolute customer satisfaction!
good,This job should not be for humans at all. It is very exhausting and the way the system is set it you are bound to fail. No advancement opportunities at all.
good,"Amazon is a very unique place to work.  You must be prepared to adapt to a new cultural norm where the customer is #1."
good,"A typical day will start at 630 and very likely could extend beyond your end of shift. Its high stress and loud. Management plays favoritism a lot (fortunately I was favored). Some co-workers were awesome and others you question how they made it this far in life."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work if you like constant change and turnover.  Lots of exciting projects, but the company really wants you to move to Seattle if you want to move ahead."
good,The hardest part of the job was looking over the product for any damages. Decent amount of red tape and politics there. Medical Staff was outstanding. Getting a lot experience in the various department was great.
good,"the money is good, the job gets boring at times the work is not hard, good people to work with, love the safety program, overall pretty good job getting to know new people hate seeing people come an go. they have a pretty strict program"
good,You will lose weight if you work here and meet lots of nice people. Room for advancement if you work hard. Very good training programs.
good,Great job for a single person willing to give all their social life to Amazon.com. It's a great company but has a very specific vision about what it means to be frugal.
good,"Management doesn't communicate with each other. Some of the people are fun to work with, gets your through the day. The hardest part is knowing that your just a number to the company. The let you know that you can be replaced, only problem is they seem to keep the slackers and the good ones seem to get sick of it and leave. Amcare and HR is a joke."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time there and would recommend it to someone wanting to pursue a career in human resources. "
good,"Fast pace and making sure you get production."
good,"- Random"
good,"A typical day at work was very fast and active, I learned how to work with a big group of people. Management was ok I felt like some mangers cared and some didn't. I got along with my co-workers. The hardest part about the job was standing for long periods of time and walking. The most enjoyable part of working at Amazon was trying and learning something new."
good,"I was working as the final stop of the Amazon process, so sorting pre-packed parcels on to their routes."
good,"Not so much of  a great environment good pace of work but a lot of racism, Great managers , little time for lunch and break with alot of hours of shift, worst food and not so good vending machines"
good,"I personally wouldn't recommend working for Amazon, overall the co workers are nice people but the management SUCKS ! I'm a 21 years old and the managers are only but a few years older than me maybe a little younger who knows because they clearly don't know what they're doing, they will speak to you in a very demeaning manner which is very unnecessary and uncalled for and once you try to voice you own opinion or a problem you have they act as though they don't care one bit, in my opinion you do too much for too little. As much as i do at that job i should be making more than 11.50 an hour."
good,worked here as an intern and loved it. Managers are very supportive here and everyone here is very smart. I learnt a lot in this company
good,"Hard working facility that want to make sure each customer was happy. My days flew by at this place. It could be overwhelming at times, but overall is was a great place to work!"
good,Work begins at 630 and ends at 530. The occupation does not really require you to have a brain it includes a long day of only scanning products in to the system. Great place just not for me.
good,"typical work day is stretching grab scanners go to location and start counting, fun and energetic  co-workers. it maybe a stress full job but knowing that work was taken care with no issues"
good,"I work in inbound at CVG3 in Hebron, KY. I come in and check to see where I'm at for the day. I'm either in a unrated or rated task. Associates work on the dock or they receive so the items can be sent to outbound to get shipped out. The co-workers at CVG3 are nice and very outgoing. They offer help when it is needed. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and getting to know them."
good,while working with amazon I learned to work on my own and as part of a team. I enjoyed working here as I made good friends from all walks of life and cultures
good,"Working a amazon was very productive, long hours and hard work, but I learned several different job while I was there, that I feel will help me in a future job. I met a lot of people there, and became friends with many. I have always been a people person, I got along with everyone."
good,"I'm a part of a teamwork that is responsible for a variety of task."
good,"Amazon is a great company to work for if you are looking for a challenge. You will work on broad scope, disruptive projects that will develop you at any level in your career. The pace is fast, the work is interesting and the people are fun."
good,"I enjoyed the environment and met a lot of interesting people along the way. To be apart of this job you have to work at a fast pace. To work at this job you need a lot of time to work. My days would start at six thirty at night and end at five thirty in the morning. Long nights were needed to work and I am able to work with very little sleep. I would find the items that needed to be shipped and send them out for shipping. The hardest part of my job was being on my feet all day, but I handled it. The best part of my job was meeting interesting people along the way. I learned from this job that working overnight is nothing to joke about. It is hard work and not as enjoyable as the day shift."
good,"You stay in a warehouse for 10-12 hours four-five days a week, if it's hot outside it hot in the warehouse or cold outside it's cold in the warehouse. Honestly I don't think my feet have hurt that bad ever in my life. But while you work there you end up making the best of it, you make friends since you can't have music or your phone."
good,"Depends on the team you are with, work life balance varies. It is all set by senior management."
good,"Fast paced environment, diverse group of people, strict safety and production guidelines, hard work. Great place to work, everyone is friendly, and management is good."
good,"10 hour work days, 4 days a week leaves you with a 3 day weekend. Employees start the day with stretches and being informed of what the workload looks like for the current shift. Then, you proceed to your work station to pack items, power industrial truck to obtain items from up to 45 feet in the air, or to where your scanner is telling you to pick up an item on the ground from the hundreds of shelves. 2 hours later, you get a 10 minute break. then it's back to the grind. About 2 and a half hours later, it's lunch time, which you get 30 minutes for. After that, more stretches, and a progress report of how well your shift has done and how much the shift has left to go. About 2 and a half hours after that, another 10 minute break. Then back to the grind for the final and longest push of the day."
good,"Assist with company needs to work in all areas of production in order to ensure business needs are met including Tote replenishment, Internal Quality, Vender Returns, and Problem Solving. Follow strict safety, quality, and production standards. Seasonal trainer for new hires."
good,fun work environment. I learned to be a good employee. was taught to have patience and the customer always right. very fast pace gotta stay moving but great exercises
good,I was able to enhance my abilities to work in a warehouse. I was able to work as a team player. I was to enhance my  skills  for my future goals.
good,An advantage of my time in amazon is learning how to use Microsoft packages on a computer such as excel formulas and oracle financials. I have met many co-workers that I regularly meet outside of work for social events and sport activities. The toughest part of my job is making sure our internal customers have their corrugate supplies and count information so they can manage their teams and forecast their supplies respectively.
good,my typical day included me loading trailers for 12 hours Monday through Friday. I learned how to stack a trailer a lot better. the co-workers were great to work with. the management was pretty good. the hardest part of my job was when I was in a trailer that was the busies doing it all by myself. I enjoyed working hard and getting a free work out
good,Hunt for new stores and do opreations related work including delivery and return back of goods given to store retailers.
good,I pack and wrap customers orders I handle inventory as well as the vendors supplies. I stack boxes on the truck to be delivered
good,Everyday was something different and the people i worked with took they time explaining everything in detail so i got to doing things pretty fast.
good,"It's a typical call center environment. They pay is decent, and the benefits are great. The quality of management varies, although they claim to all be calibrated on how issues are handled. Management won't even consider interviewing you unless your resume is perfect to their standards, even if you are more qualified than other applicants. Most co-workers are fun, but some will find anything to complain about, and others don't understand basic hygiene. If you have a family or participate in activities outside of work, this job may not be for you The shifts are unreasonable unless you're in management, and they often assign you mandatory overtime with only a 24 hour notice. The break room is very nice. There is books, board games, video games, movies, and a really neat self service store."
good,My day starts off at 9:30PMand ends at 8:00AM. The overnight hours are a tough shift. I have learned more about logistics even though I have prior experience in that area.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things and meeting the goals set for me.
good,"While working for the Amazon Fulfillment Center in Chattanooga, TN the first thing one would  notice is that it is very high in demand so you are always busy.  You are on your feet (standing or walking) for ten hours a day.  There is little room for error because you have a daily quota to meet in a certain amount of time and the whole process throughout the whole warehouse to make certain that our customers are completely satisfied by all of their orders."
good,Good things and bad. somethings overall were good others could have been better. The benefits were good. The hours were too long. I like shorter days.
good,great day..great people and good work place..nothing really just work hard and have fun...clean work place at all times
good,"uma grande empreza com a direcao horrivel , muitos beneficios , amigos de vendas otimos aprendi que devemos mesmo tendo um cargo superior devemos tratar bem os funcionarios coisas que me gerente deixou a desejar , porem uma otima empresa"
good,"It was quite an experience where I got to learn about corporate culture. It was a challenging. Learnt a lot about team co-ordination, team work and managing to meet deadlines."
good,Investigating the seller accounts on the website and finding risky elements and taking appropriate actions to ensure safe buyer experience
good,The day began by talking about the totals from the previous day. We would be allocated jobs matched to strengths. Th job was very fast paces so I needed excellent ability to concentrate and work at speed. There were lots of different roles in the warehouse but I mainly worked as unloading and stowing.
good,"Great work hours and very good team work, Would not mind going back to amazon at all great area and very good managers and i really do not want to keep tying in the survery"
good,"Typical day involved me to Check the stock list then act accordingly i.e unloading unpack aging heavy boxes sometimes by hand other time by machinery it was demanding in the sense that you had to be well aware and be extremely careful not to damage whats inside."
good,Basically  you pick and pack all day the long work hours is the only down side could be more work friendly but you learn good team work skills and it is a very live atmosphere.
good,"You would stand for long periods at a time,you worked at a fast pace and long hours, there were short breaks,  and overtime was made available."
good,"A typical day at work would be sumbitting orders threw Amazon and i learned alot by using Word Excel and Ups, Fedex management. The co-workers are really good to be around with and very helpful at anytime. also the hardest part would be when a really big purchase order would be breaking it down and inputting it through excel and not having the product. the most enjoyable part would be our breaks becuase i  have fun with alot of my co-workers."
good,working for this company is a very good experience. not only because of the job tittle but also the people that work with you day by day. everyone is very awsome and everyone has teamwork in them.
good,"Telephone customer service consists of eight hours a day of speaking to strangers, who may be polite and friendly or angry and personally abusive. In either case, your job is to be so friendly and engaging that they hang up the phone feeling like you did a great job, even if you were not actually able to do what they wanted you to do."
good,loved it..fast paced ..smooth work enviroment..people are great..everybody happy..loved working with the models...my supervisor was very kool..
good,I never thought that i would end up working in a warehouse. This job is very challenging. If you love challenges then this job is for you.
good,These are in my initial states. I went in to the company as a entry level java developer for an internship. After I graduated they provided me a full-time job and then I had plans coming US to pursue my masters.
good,leaders could of been more one on one time with there employees and let them know how they are doing on their numbers . other than that it was a good company .
good,"Start at 6:30 and wait in the queue for about 2 hours to load the parcels in your van."
good,"typical day at amazon inbound: receive inventory from dock, then receive into the system then stowed for customer to order."
good,Good benefits but pay is not great. Most jobs are easy but be prepared to be on your feet for 10 hrs a day and walking a lot. Most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships you get to build with coworkers and management and coming together as a team.
good,"A typical day at amazon was to go inside, pass security and stretch."
good,A typical day at work for me consist of me fulfilling customer orders as they come through on the scanner that I use. We as pickers walk on average up to 10-12 miles a day. I don't get to spend to my time with my coworkers because we have a fast pace job but the ones I do know personally are a joy to work with. The hardest part of my job is making sure I have energy to last me a long 10hour day 4 days in a row.  Management has really help me to learn a lot and become a better worker then I was the day before. The most enjoyable part about my job is teaching my co workers and watching the light bulb come on when they finally get something.
good,A temporary position for the christmas rush of orders. It was hard work but enjoyable. Every person from management to floor was respectful and very helpful.
good,"Fast paced, good pay especially with all the overtime, helpful management, very repetitive and competitive. The people I  worked with were pretty cool, I did not talk to a lot of people, but on breaks (which are pretty short) I was able to have some social time."
good,Some days management does not know what they want and you are given conflicting instructions. New procedures not always given to everyone. Unhappy co-workers. Low morale.
good,It is a fast paced environment that has a continuous flow. It is a job that is growing and is going to be around for many years to come.
good,Your typical day will include standing on a hard rubber mat and opening boxes all day/night and searching customer and shipment ID's. Your responsibility is to check the products and make sure they're not damaged.
good,"At Amazon I learned how to operate a pallet jack and pick items. A typical day was ten hours of consistent hard work. Management was very social to a point where the work environment didn't feel like work. The co-workers that lasted were nice and enjoyed the social environment. The hardest part of the job was the physical labor and very short breaks, while the best was the overtime that was frequently offered."
good,"It's a bit political, but there are opportunities to advance. Just work hard, stay out of trouble and follow directions and you'll be fine."
good,Amazon is a secure job with very productive work place. It has decent pay and great benefits. However poor management and even worse co-workers
good,"good place  to work"
good,"Good culture, great people here to work with. Good benefits to employees...also good facilities"
good,"Amazon.com is a typical warehouse job where I learn how to drive the PIT and TDR. Management sucks the treat you like slaves and shorten your break. My co-workers is the reason why I stayed so long, the help me get through the struggle and pain. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the racism. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers."
good,"I worked for Amazon as a contractor and I wouldn't recommend working there as a full time employee because you will not have a life. It is great to be a contractor because you can leave work at work whereas if you are FTE you are working 80 hours a week, no joke."
good,"always the same everyday, fast pace. management werent very helpful. got laid off when i was hitting targets one day and the next day they checked i wasnt hitting them so got laid off"
good,I had an a amazing experience working with amazon. Always had to be on your toes. It is a hardworking company . A typical day at amazon will have your legs to your feet sore the whole night. I learned how to pace myself and work at a good speed. Management and co-worker were very helpful. The hardest part of this job was staying on my feet. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new faces everyday.
good,Amazon is a fast paced environment and provides with ample opportunities to work towards positive change. It is a challenging yet fulfilling environment to manage and lead teams towards success.
good,The distance to work was quiet important as i was leaving at Abbey wood at the time and the job was based down slough 2 and half hours to get to work
good,"Amazon is a great place for someone who does not have experience to learn all there is about warehouse work. I learned a lot at Amazon, how to train new hires, drive PIT, how to solve problems and how to manage a department. Everyday was fast paced and you had to stay on your toes to get the job done.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the success I had at the end of the day making our numbers and that there was no accidents."
good,A typical work day at Amazon was very long and fast pasted place to work and learned new jobs there at different times while working there and lost of management in all departments lots of coworkers worked with got along well with everyone always just sometimes the long 12 hour shifts working around all kind of different people.
good,it was a reat experience and i would have loved to get hired on but that was just a temp position every year.. they did not like to outside hire.
good,"Fast pace at all times. Many opportunities to learn and advance."
good,love the zeal and productivity at my workplace. Sometimes very intense work day with 18 hours of work. But like every job it has its own ups and downs.
good,The job was easy. Management was good until they began letting employees watch their workers work and time their speed during high season. (Christmas). Overall the job was a good place to work.
good,I only worked seasonal at this job the pay was ok and the job was easy. I would go back another season if called back. The hours were awesome. There were so many different schedules to choose from.
good,"look at job duties and report to station"
good,I learned that the work though a bit boring at times was mostly fun. My immediate managers were always helping. The person in charge of medical fired me when the person learned that I had a no work order from my doctor. Apparently if I couldn't work and I was a temp I had to be let go.
good,"Long hours, kind of monotonous work, but ok for some quick money around the holidays. There are a lot of people there and the place is big, but it's less overwhelming than some people make it seem: parking isn't that bad, etc."
good,If you start working here please be sure to wear good reliable comfortable shoes you do a lot of walking. It is a hard laboring job.
good,"*Working Hard"
good,"The life is kind of stagnant in the company. Amazon when started was pretty good and employee friendly. However, now it is very difficult to spend even a single day at work and has become a BPO contributing to high level of stress."
good,"It was fine when it came to a few co-workers, but the working conditions where unhealthy and the breaks where very short while working long hours and mandatory overtime"
good,"The 3 tenets of successful business:  Quality, Quantity, and Customer Service. Quality is sacrificed here. Numbers are the name of the game. Temp(-to-hire) employees receive more pressure to reach quota through the staffing agency personnel than Amazon employees. The emphasis on quality is made during onboarding, but sacrificing quality to process more units is the unspoken rule that leadership isn't advertising. The most successful employees are those that understand this rule and/or have lax quality standards themselves."
good,"Really liked the environment. If you are a hard worker, you will do fine. I actually quit so I could find a better paying job but I really liked the people at Amazon."
good,Amazon prefer hire a lazy people who rather sigh in VTO( voluntary time off) sheet than hire a loyal hard working people.
good,"The biggest adventage is that I have practiced working knowledge of Lean Six Sigma tools, Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)."
good,"ok place to build skills with a mega company, lots of structure, makes job easier, clean, progressive workplace, night shift is not for me though"
good,"Extremely long hours and management did not care about your input"
good,I felt that production was the most inmportant thing that managemnt was concerned with.
good,picked out products that needed to be shipped out. Hardest part of the job was how much I had to walk a day.
good,"Over all good company,Fast patgjyfjfjtyhugttghbki,hdutyoilhgfdsw5t6y7u8polkijuyt5erty9olkjhgswer789olkiuytsertyuipoygtuiopojhygtfgyhced"
good,productive and your always staying busy. you have to know how to manage your time on packing boxes per hour.
good,"Company is good in learning and developing the employers to next level."
good,"Loved my co-workers who were on the front line with me taking back to back phone calls with laughter in between.  "
good,"A typical day"
good,"was seasonal work"
good,"The work was easy, but their quotas were a bit hard to hit. the hours were very harsh."
good,"Constant work, droning and unfulfilling. Taking 10 minutes to get outside for a break, however you only get 30 minutes break (unpaid) so by the time you go out have food and go back you have ten minutes to ram something inside you before you switch off and carry on working."
good,"My typical day was when I got to Amazon was packing items either small, medium or large items by single, multi or hybrid stations and they were for customers or to eventually go to shops. I learned what its like to work as a packager as ive never done it before and a few other things aswel. Dont know about management as I was working under Am2Pm recruiment agency. My co-workers were ok didnt cause a problem left me to get on with my own work. Hardest part was when they vto me half the time i can go home cause theres no transport at the times they vto people so im stuck there and if theres no work the same again."
good,"It is a learning experience, somewhat advancement, a career to grow in."
good,"Laborous. Always moving boxes with products and if you can multitask with speed and precision you can get ""promoted"" w/o pay of-course to Kick-Out and/or Problem Solve areas of Outbound. The thing I didn't like about Outbound was doing ""water-spider"" at Singles where you just get swamped without help and you have ""Ask Me"" jackets telling you to go fetch blue add-on lights left and right when they think you aren't fast enough. You get 15 mins break before and after your 30 min lunch break which having a wrist watch can help in time-management so you dont work over them. Don't ever leave your gloves its a headache to get one on your first week. I believe pay increase is after a year unless you apply for a higher tier level and do it during peek season, pronto!"
good,"Great place to work, very active workplace. The people are friendly and willing to help you anyway they can. The work is challenging but goes at a steady pace. You get 3 breaks to get some water and rest before you continue your work. Stations are maintained and kept stocked with supplies that you need."
good,Good place to kick start your Testing career. Growth is really hard. Compensation is comparatively lower than other MNCs
good,"Amazon challenges your skills and helps you grow at the intense,fast pace."
good,"My typical day was packing customers orders ready to be shipped out with the relevant documentation in a timely manner."
good,Its very fast pace you learn lots of things from a business point of view you learn to grind very hard over a period of time an you see every one work together to get a common goal.
good,"lots of parcels to sort and deliver, management were very strict and overly bossy.  The warehouse was a fun place to work as my co-workers were fun to be around"
good,"la mia mansione in amazon era fare l'addetta al picking e controllo qualità ,mi sono trovata molto bene in questa azienda pero pultroppo cercavano solo per il periodo del picco natalizio."
good,i enjoyed being part of a team and working with managers aswell as floor staff when the holiday rush ended i was one of the last temps to be laid off
good,This job was very physical and very strict If I had a chance to return I WOULD NOT because the work conditions were so hard. There would be many people in small work areas at a time which made work harder. Breaks were very limited as well. I would not recommend this job to someone who has kids.
good,"your typical warehouse job. you pick orders, pack orders, and load trucks. you drive order pickers."
good,Always doing something never a chance to stop. The most enjoyable part is knowing I could always better myself there. The hardest part was walking long distances for a long period of time. I learned that keeping a steady pace at amazon is very important.
good,i stocked boxes neatly on trucks. worked non stop for 10 hours a day with overtime. good people there
good,"You were expected to keep up with your work performance on a daily regardless if you prep for you assignment or not."
good,"Great opportunity overall. Company was only seeking seasonal work, at the time I was fresh out of school and looking for a way to get started with experience."
good,"I would arrive at work, clock in, and head to my area for an every morning meeting. The meeting involved stretches and numbers for the day. After that, I would go over to the inbound board to check which stowing department I was stationed to be in. If in regular stowing, I would go grab a scanner, a cart full of items, and head to any of the four shelving sections of the warehouse. I would them scan in to log in to my scanner, scan the code on the cart, an item's code, and then the code for the shelf it is to be stored on."
good,Amazon.com has great benefits. The pay is good but not great.
good,Pay was good but you definitely had to work for it.  Too demanding of a job when you have a family.  Not the type of work for everyone.
good,"Hard working culture, very customer orientated. Leadership principles allow for out of the box thinking. Want to try something? You get the opportunity to improve processes."
good,A demanding role however i was able to meet the deadlines to ensure an effective service was delivered.
good,The management is good. Hours are good. The pay could be better. Safety is very good.
good,Amazon provides its employees a non restriction work place. Which help the employees in many ways to work comfortably without any stress.
good,this job is good but it does not agrre with my blood pressure. your moving all the time and they time your performance
good,"its a decent job just too far out for the amount of pay. A typical day at work would be to clock in. Go to group meeting, then go get scan gun and start working. I learned how to work with others. Management is fairly decent, they don't stand over your shoulder. They only track you down when your off and your rate is down. Co-workers are friendly and love interact with others. The hardest part of the job is just doing it repetitively with minimum breaks. The most enjoyable part of the job is leaving."
good,"Good work environment. Lots of smart colleagues. Learned a lot about data center IT equipment power and mechanical equipment requirements."
good,"-handling critical tasks on an every day basis"
good,"I learned a lot on the distributed computing framework which is now a demand for almost every company either small or big. It is good place for developers, but life is a little hectic and sometimes, it becomes an issue to have work life balance."
good,"I don't mind amazon. I do not see it as a career choice, but very fun, very fast, overtime available most the time."
good,"stowing goods to a high target with poor work condidions "
good,This job is great and has a reasonable work / life balance. It also has reasonable pay.
good,"My rating on a scale from 1-5 for working at Amazon, would be a 3. Management wasn't all that great, and it was a ton of labor work. I enjoyed the people that I worked with most of the time."
good,"the hardest part is you work on shift of 10h, but you have 3 days free"
good,"Secondo la mia esperienza la giornata lavorativa si articolava su due turni alternati settimanalmente (5-13 / 15-23), sei giorni su sette."
good,"Not the ideal place to be employed, long hours and bad working conditions."
good,there is 1000 employee on every shifts it has a 2 square miles of warehouse
good,"An accounts payable department has many responsibilities to fulfill to ensure that payments to suppliers are made on time and the needs for flexibility in the organization"
good,"Amazon Warehouse is large, and the workers are left to tackle the task of picking goods on their own. This requires independence."
good,"Amazon has to be the worst job I have ever had its to much walking, breaks are short, and hours are long. You get write up's for every quality or rate error so there is no job security."
good,"I was hired for this job during the holiday rush. One thing to note about work at Amazon is that it's a completely impersonal job. As in, in the typical day, you go to a morning and lunch board meeting, where they talk about today's goals. You never get to know your manager by name, because they are not personally involved in your job. From there, you pick up a scanner, and go to work, scanning items into/out of the system, while keeping up a fast rate of work. The job itself isn't hard, but the fast pace is, as is the extreme isolation. Think, nobody to talk to for the bulk of the time. And if you do meet coworkers you are friends with, good luck with that. They routinely move employees to different sections, different floors, or different sides of the warehouse. This would be the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part was simply that for a temp job, you got a tremendous salary, and learned a ton of basic skills. I received salary in one week equal to two weeks of work at Walmart."
good,Exercise and hard work are a must  in order to really notice a benifit in all your efforts
good,Working at Amazon wasn't that bad besides all the walking and long days. I was nice to get paid after a long week of working ten hours  and when i was there overtime was mandatory.
good,It is good co job is secure some VCP and stock we are getting monthly and once a year
good,It is a a job not for the weak. You must be dedicated to working hard. It is a good company to work for i just ha an injury and they would not let me return.
good,"Amazon as such is a great place to work. You get to work with some of the brightest minds around a typical day at work is not without challenges that can test your abilities to the core. "
good,"3 years worked there and no respect employees are never informed of anything you are just a number period. If you can live with that go for it.  Over 3 years i had close to a dozen indirect/direct managers. If you do not hit rate you are written up end of discussion even you had faulty or damaged equipment to do job and also if there is no work available to do (crazy, right?!!!) Management also starting sending out little worker bees like the gestapo if you were at the bathroom to long (which are almost always a quarter mile away) to come and ask you what was going on and chances are it will lead to a write up for time off task. OH! and get a load of this one fire alarm went off building next store(connected) pouring rain somewhere in the 40 degree weather we were forced to stand outside with no cover for 45 min+. Finally these doofuses opened the emergency kits and got us ponchos once we were drenched and allowed us to walk to the front of the building for minimal cover as we sat there for another 45+, then we are finally allowed to re enter the building and they distribute a vendor buck worth 1 single dollar that only works in certain machines and management tells us to buy a coffee and to get back to work in soaking wet freezing t shirt, sweatshirt, boxers, sneakers,pants and anything else under no circumstances were you allowed to leave unless you had used your own personal time and if you were lucky they threw you a pair of socks thank you so very much Amazon!"
good,A lot walking.. great exercise.. but their quick to lay u off when they don't need you
good,"The job itself payed well, and the staff and management was nice. The only problem, and the reason I left, was the fact that it was incredibly physically demanding, in that I had to move constantly for about 10 hours a day with few short breaks and a 30 minute lunch."
good,my co-workers are very friendly. my job require me to stand for 10 hours which is very uncomfortable. I have learned that you have to be very careful with the packages. The most enjoyable part of my job is the breaks
good,"shipping, posting products."
good,Hard labor and good pay. Breaks are very short and mangers treat employees bad.
good,I like the culture there but I feel there is no room for advancement from the position i am currently in.
good,long 10 hours of work. offer overtime. great pay!! meet a lot of new people.
good,Long hours and short break times. Shifts can be changed day to day
good,"no consistency between departments,  Management wants 100% from employees at all times are you will be fired after three write ups.   one department has different standards with this policy, favoritism is used throughout the work place.  employees getting written up and fired for 97% or 99% productivity,"
good,It was a good opportunity but the people who were in charge weren't very professional at all.
good,"Cab facility is a plus"
good,The employees are great to work with. the pay was ok. The company was not prejudice against piercings or tattoos.
good,"Easy job, management is horrible"
good,"was a demanding work role, would have to be quick in order to keep up productivity."
good,I learned how to assemble items in to different packages and work with a scanner. I enjoyed the company and working well with others.
good,one job for 10-12 hours all day everyday. took a bit to get use to standing in one spot for long periods of time
good,horrible work environment. mean people. unbearable expectations
good,Good feeling to know with the hard team and long hours work everyone got their Holiday packages.
good,Amazon Ware House is an enjoyable place to work. There are good people there who make the job fun and productive. The most enjoyable part of my job is connecting with the people I work with everyday. A typical day at the job consists of picking packing or loading merchandise for shipment to customers .
good,"The general labor at amazon was manageable and easy to comprehend. The only complaint I have... management is determined by who you know, who you are friends with and what you can do outside of work for the current management. At amazon, your rate is important to stay working there, but your benefits to management as a Person, not an employee, will determine if you rise to a higher position in the long run."
good,"very fast paced "
good,I love this job.  I wish they wouldn't have a rate system but it was ok
good,Was a decent place to work.  I learned some valuable skills while here.  I also worked with some hard working people.  Management was slack to say the least however we had a good team of people so that help balance things out.
good,Putting merchandise in areas for pickers to pull orders. I've learned how the company works. The management team are ok. Some people dont like to help the new people out cause(some have bad communication skills).The job is not hard at all.
good,"Não tenho do que fala da empresa , mais so que atuamos na rua entregando mercadorias de altos valor , o risco de roubo e grande , ja passei por isso,"
good,"I'm a part-time, seasonal employee at Amazon, which is a warehouse. A typical day at work, for me, is to scan packages to the correct location and get them ready for shipment. I've learned how to get packages ready for shipment. My co-workers are a very good team to work with. The hardest part of the job is the extreme heat and standing on my feet for long periods of time because of my medical condition, everything else is easy. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a nice group of people."
good,"trained new and existing employees in how to properly work in a safe environment based on policy and procedure. Fast-paced receiving, stocking, picking products and orders for customers. Working in groups to improve innovation, productivity and safety."
good,"I learned how to pick pack and ship items to other companies,you work long hours and are normally tired by the time you finish they have a strict 3 point disaplinary system which makes you very nervous about being late or have time off for illness"
good,"packing orders for shipping to customers"
good,"Your work will have a direct impact on customers. You will deliver software at 3x rate than other companies. You will often invent and simplify, dive deep and own a lot of things."
good,"My typical day was either Operating the reach truck helping other pickers, ICQA members, inbound/outbound help on a daily basis. worked closely with management also performing tasks and drops that they needed in order to complete there own tasks. my Co-workers were very good and a few have become very good friends of mine. I actually learnt how to operate the reach truck through Amazon. That being the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Amazon will recognize you for doing a good job and give you  vendor bucks and coupons. My co-workers were very friendly and fun to work with. The hardest part is always trying to meet the quota with minimum mistakes. The job was fun because you got to see a lot of different things come in. You never knew what would be in the boxes.
good,goos work environment and nice place to look at mrchandise. very big in space.
good,"It was challenging as I was timed by the scanner"
good,people here have petty good technical skills. New graduates can learn quite a lot from the company
good,"10 hr shifts, lifting 50+ lbs boxes, standing all night 2 15 (really  9 min) break 30 min lunch"
good,"Amazon is a great place to work, your work days fly by because your so busy."
good,"The work is incredibly monotonous. It makes the days pass slowly, however my co-workers are friendly and management seems to care most days. There is not a lot of room to advance, they hire a lot from outside Amazon instead of promoting hourly associates who may be more qualified."
good,"You do a lot of walking,they give away gift cards and gifts for production often."
good,"fast paced , long hours , good money. could not keep balance between job and life"
good,Driving people from the hotel to the airport & vice versa & working the fr desk
good,"The job can sometimes be challenging when trying to make rate every week, but as long as you work your hardest and move a fairly quick pace, you will be fine. I really enjoyed working with my coworkers the most."
good,"Amazon.Com is all about work hard , have fun and make history"
good,"Working there was overall pretty stressful due to co-workers being rude to you everyday. Management was very nice and strict, they really cared about your safety."
good,its cold. amazon leaves you feeling unappreciated. they always expect more out of you but give nothing in return.
good,packing packages for customers with a daily rate to keep up with. always above average!
good,Plenty of work. The walking distance is horrible. The rates are unrealistic at times. Management doesn't do much to help. Coworkers stay to themselves. Hardest part is meeting rate. Most enjoyable part is break and clocking out.
good,good place to work and you will meet some very nice employees along with very good supervisors and managers
good,"Typically work at Amazon is pretty standard to most jobs. Required rates of work and attendance expectancy are normal here as with most places. The problem they seem to have on most occasions though is a lack of empathy for the employee as well as a poor understanding of the work required by the management team. While they normally have ways of voicing your grievances there is little effort to do much to help with them and instead it's usually brushed under the rug. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with great people and helping them succeed in their jobs, but the hardest part is that I'm usually expected to work upwards of 3 different jobs at the same time. While I can normally do this where most can not, it does hurt my ability to better solve issues. What I've learned from working here is that you should never take your employees for granted and that just pretending to care is not enough to keep them there and working to their best potential."
good,The work day days was long but you learned lot about the amazon way the management was great they help out a lot and i loved meeting  some of my co-workers hardest part of the job was o a lot of heavy lifting and the most enjoyable part of the job was the difference   cultures there
good,"i start at 6.00 am , i park my car and i watch hour, i started my work and i stop it for lunch, then i re start and i finish at 14.00 pm. i learn a    fast job and be good in packing. the manager isn t very good but is a serious man, my co worker are gently and fun, the hardest part of the job is a fast workstandard, the most enjoyable part is stay near at many people."
good,The hardest part is standing on your feet all day. Once you get passed that its easy. They train you very effectively and make sure you know how to do the job assigned to the best of your ability. If you are struggling they will definitely help you out and figure out what can be fixed or changed.
good,Management most of the time seems to not know what's going on which creates a lot of chaos on the job.
good,Worked in Maintenance. After 7 years its hard to let go but in order to advance in my career i must leave. The business concept of Amazon.com is wonderful! On the other hand i believe strongly that this company has gotten too big for its britches.
good,"Muito boa de convivência com colegas e patrões, aprendi como recepcionar clientes, coordenação de boletos, com ela aprendi a ser uma boa secretaria."
good,"•	Maintain good relationship with customers through personnel contacts, meeting or via telephone."
good,the people an the pay was good i hate it was temp i couldve seen myself there for awhile
good,I am getting older and the job was too much strain on my body.  The day to day operations were important and I very much enjoyed my time there.  They are very efficient in their employee selection and their needs from one day to the next.  The hardest part of the job was being on my feet for 8-12 hours at a time.
good,"scan the cart walk around and find the right item of the bins in the warehouse .I learned the faster the better working for Amazon, I got a long with all my mangers. Got along with my co-workers we made work go by faster. Nothing was hard I caught along quickly with the job. Meeting our daily goals,"
good,always on a rate to pull product from shevles and forklift operator . Also packed orders
good,Long days with lots of walking with meetable standards. Managers breathing down your neck. No sense of job security.
good,"I learned how to operated a cherry picker and RF gun daily. I was to pick customer's orders that were due out for shipment in a very fast paced and detail oriented environment. Quality and quantity were a very important part of the job, while keeping your rate above average. Management seems like they are on top off their job performances. I enjoyed working with most of my co-workers. One of the hardest parts of the job was remembering all the locations and keeping up on the rate expected. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to operate a cherry picker, going up and down in the air all day."
good,This was the first job I received after my freshman year of college and it was a great start. They have many different branches in the facility and there is always work to be done. I would recommend it as a great starting point for good work experience in any field.
good,"The ways of doing things is very peculiar that is why it is called a Peculiar company."
good,"Listen, I don't believe in badmouthing former employees. But this is a required section, so I'll do it."
good,"It was an okay place to work at, but after awhile I wanted something new, to be in a new job."
good,It was a good place to work. I worked there for over a year and in the mean time they treated me respectfully and though it was a very active job I enjoyed it. I just dislike how short the lunch breaks are.
good,"workload very high"
good,You got coaches who are suppose to help when you need it or cover so you can use the restroom but don't. They think their the best of the best and blame others for their mistakes.
good,Very organized and clean but the travel to and from work is bad because in between shifts is usually the city's rush hour.
good,"Duties include, Process Guide on Stow, Problem Solver on Stow, Stowing, Receive scanning and updating item Database."
good,Very fast  paste and friendly atmosphere a team player supervisor.
good,I would come in and clock in and we would have a meeting to say where the area we would be working at. Go to that area and report to the person in charge and get doing where they want wanted me to start at. Get merchandise and check for damages and scan in products and put them away.
good,I enjoy working here but I want to find room to grow in a workplace.
good,"people i worked with was nice,and helpful.very safe place to work for and very clean"
good,"Good people to work with.  "
good,Was a tough temp job. Worked long hours with last second required overtime.
good,Fast paced environment with many hard working employees. Get to work with many different types of people.
good,"Working at amazon was a great experience.  I enjoyed working there.  It's very fast paced but I managed to get the job done."
good,Strenuous job with long hours. Learned to sort prodcts. Management was lazy and harsh. Co workers were easy to get along with.
good,"This job was great, it provided the opportunity to develop additional skills in, warehousing, order pulling and ship processing."
good,"Start  your  day by  stretching, it's high energy fast pace job. The management is very caring. your co-workers are kind and helpful. The hardest part of the job is you'll walk over 20 miles a day. the most enjoyale part of the day is co existing with your co- workers."
good,"Although some staff members are uptight, most of them were easy to get along with."
good,"The work day was long 10 hours or more on your feet.  I decided that using my brains for a days work was the way to earn a check.  Management was okay, several different so did not get to know any on a personal basis.  Several coworkers in a large warehouse.  Staying on your feet all day. Nothing was enjoyable about the job."
good,A typical day at work is making the customers happy. I learned how to work as a team. The management was fairly decent. Most of the co workers are nice. The hardest part of my job was working 12 hours. The part I enjoyed the most was seeing all the neat items.
good,Scanning packages and stocking. Lots of walking all night for productivity. Very good place to work. I work with great people.
good,"It's a good job, the hours are long but I like gettin off 3 days a week."
good,very easy job. all postions are common sense. the attitude of the company can be harsh at times. long hours standing is the hardest part.
good,"Typical day at work would be managing workflow for 80+ employees, and making sure that customer orders are fulfilled in a timely manner.  What I learned at Amazon.com was that nothing stays still, something always has to be modified even if it works perfectly. Also, I got to experience different backgrounds and cultures as well. Management in Amazon.com is a hit or miss. Sometimes you could get amazing managers and sometimes you would get the ""Pawn it off on someone else"" type of managers. The hardest part of the job would be learning new people by name since the turnover rate is EXTREMELY HIGH for amazon.com. The most enjoyable part of the job would be meeting new people and help furthering others in their career path."
good,"Amazon has definitely enlarged my perspective concerning the retail market in a whole. I have learned the importance of customer services on a greater level. A typical day at Amazon would consist of focusing on sells and percentile of customer satisfaction.The quantity; also quality of merchandise on the market has given me a joy of meeting customers needs and delivery deadlines. Working with a outstanding team daily, has allowed me to be appreciative of the field of Retail; whole sales.."
good,if you are a student I wouldn't suggest working there because its hard but it is a overall good place to work if you need extra cash.
good,Working for Amazon.com i learned that one has to push to be better everyday while also staying consistent with day to day activities. My coworkers were very friendly and were always there to help any time their assistance was needed. The job was fairly easy  and did not require a ton of thought which might have been the most enjoyable and hardest part of the job depending on the day.
good,"Very fast pasted environment. I learned a lot of different functions, and departments while at amazon.com."
good,"Une journée type est rythmé au grés des pauses (2 pauses d'un quart d'heure chrono). Sinon selon le poste où vous êtes attribués vous faites la même chose toutes la journée avec une cadence soutenu. Le droit à l'erreur n'est pas autorisées sous peine d'avertissement. "
good,A typical day was putting product on shelves to get picked by pickers to get shipped to customers. my co-workers were very friendly and helpful. The hardest part I experienced was lifting heavy totes while being pregnant. I enjoyed the job in general overall.
good,"As with any jobs, there were positives and negatives.  Overall, it was an okay job."
good,"On a typical day I deal with calls doing technical support for our customers with regards to downloading music,movies and games from our website."
good,I am a customer service associate and here my job is to handle all the queries of the customers. I've learned a lot of things here by having interaction with customers and solve their queries all over the world. My management is good especially my lead and my manager are very helpful in every aspect. My co workers are cooperative. The hardest part of my job was when my lead didn't come to the office and I had to work as his back up by assisting my other co workers. As the motto of the company says work hard have fun make history. We used to enjoy while working.
good,"Amazon can be a challenging place to work. It has a 100 mph culture and the expectations on employees is very high. However, there are great opportunities to work with some of the brightest and most talented people in the industry and on innovative projects. Few people last more than a couple/few years here, but most move on to bigger and better things because of the experience Amazon provided."
good,"I got hired to work for amazon through a temp service call integrity staffing. The pay is good and I learned a lot of new skills such as how to operate a cherry picker. Management was ok, i feel it's very hard to move to a permanent position with amazon through this particular temp staffing. The co workers are very friendly and fun to be around. The hardest part of the job to me was making daily rate but it is possible. The most enjoyable part was working in a friendly environment."
good,"Horaires de travail: 2X8"
good,you learn alot in very little time but helps you get your skills up without you even knowing that your progressing
good,Best place to be in. It was a privilege working in amazon. It was enjoyable at the same time a learning experience.
good,A good opportunity once you zero in on the right products to promote.
good,"Pack products that need to be delivered to amazon customers."
good,"I was a lead in ICQA shift 2 for 3 yrs. I seldom see my manager(s), so I do all the decision on nights. My co-workers respected me as their lead, because I worked with them. I do cycle counting and do problem solving too. Whenever I had new associates I always give them respect, and never under estimate them, because you don't know what's their capabilities. I always enjoy my job, especially when I accomplished or hit my goal that day. The hardest part of my job was when I don't see my manager and no e-mails, so I do all the decision makings that day or that week, but I always make it right , and always survived :) ...."
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in at the beginning of your shift and punching in for work. Working every minute of the day at a fast paste to process and ship orders out to customers. Ten hour shifts, two ten minute and a half hour break......"
good,"it's easy work, good pay, and an uplifting atmosphere. little training is needed, and the co workers share a humorous dislike for the company."
good,a day at amazon is fun but there is also hard work to do there to
good,"Worked the night shift for ten hours, it wasn't really hard. The only hard part about the job was walking and making your rate. I enjoyed how fast-paced it was, everyone was moving without any hesitation."
good,"I didn't necessarily like this job, it was an okay job though, not too hard not too easy."
good,Good job to have just seasonal. Very particular with count of things coming in and out warehouse. I worked on dock unloading and loading truck so we had to count the product coming in and make sure it was labeled right to be put up in the right area to be pulled later for shipping.
good,WORK like a dog for 10 hours...minus breaks. At Amazon it's all about the RATE !!!
good,just a typical day and it is nothing fancy. if you like working in warehouses then it is the job for you. 
good,"On a daily basis you can take up to 50 contacts per day, this can be from phone call to reviewing emails that come in, I look at every contact and will work out what is required, this can be replacing the order or refunding, or to chase up with different carriers on were the order is."
good,"it was ok "
good,"§	Extremely productive in high volume, high stress, environments§	Self starter with a can do attitude§	Enthusiastic and a fast learner§	Able to execute tasks under pressure §	Well versed in computer and internet operations§	Always willing to assist others"
good,"The job itself was a pretty good job. I hated that you had to stay a temp without getting hired on, and after so much time has passed if you have not got the chance to get hired on through the company they would lay you off work. But this is also a fast paced work place, i Learned how to do several new things which is always good, the more experience i can get the better off I will be in the long run. Here I learned how to do shipping and receiving also had the chance to work on the dock loading and unloading trucks using a pallet jack. I also used a RF scanner which comes in handy because a lot of company's use the same type of scanners and i now have experience on them."
good,"big and growing, fast paced, forward looking, work hard, relaxed atmosphere"
good,"Managers either never train you to do new things, or train you and don't let you use your acquired skills. Fast paced enviroment. Little to no room for advancement from warehouse associate. Awesome and diverse coworkers, very very physically demanding work."
good,"In the position I currently hold, one has the opportunity to walk anywhere from 10-14 miles per day!  That detail is probably the most challenging part of job.  Another challenge of the job, is to offer an associate, that same type of challenge mentally.  Because of this, I challenge myself daily to push my body as well as my mind, as much as the management team will allow me.  I have requested to management staff to entrust me to do whatever they need done throughout a shift.  For example, it is not unreasonable for me to cover shift breaks for PA's (Production Assistants), 5S high visibility areas, train associates in PPQA, Special assignments for other departments, along with my other duties in Pick department."
good,"You must bleed Amazon and if you don't, it may not be the best place to work."
good,A typical day would be awesome because you get to work and exercise at the same time 
good,hardess part of my job is to be mislead by customers by giving you false information and passing them. 
good,"Worked with bright and interesting people. State of the art Tech firm. Overall a great place for career advancement and is the best fit for person you who is looking for career advancement and wants to work the brightest people in the field. "
good,"Picked products under supervision, always worked hard, met new people."
good,A day at Amazon.com was anything but normal. Your job description changed on a daily basis. I learned to be very flexible and obtained the ability to deal with very stressful people. The co-workers there were somewhat friendly but that could change depending on the work environment. The hardest part about the job was not having any incentive to go the extra mile but you wanted to because it was about having pride in your job. The most enjoyable part about the job were the hours and you were able to plan things around your schedule.
good,I enjoy working in a team player environment. Amazon is a very fast pace working environment. The hardest part of working at Amazon is working their peak season. I worked twelve hours days (60 hours work week for 3 months). The most enjoyable part of working at Amazon is being able to work as a team and meet the deadline for the orders so that the customers orders will arrive to them in the time stated.
good,gathering info on the orders and setting the order forums with the products.
good,"i was on the night shift so you would come, put yor things in your locker. you would them need to go clock in, go to which ever part of the building you were working in the get a briefing from the shift before and whats going to happen on our shift."
good,"Pushing a trolley roughly 8-10 miles a day. As a company Amazon is much akin to other multinational companies, both faceless and hollow."
good,i basically learn how to polish my forklift driving gaining experience and also learn to be a safe driver i believe that there where no part that was hard because i enjoyed it
good,Clock in have group talk about the records we were going to break that day Stretches Report immediately to your station full force working within 3 minutes. I learned there are people who can work and talk. Then there are people who can either work or talk If you went the first listed your employment would be short lived.
good,"Amazon.com is a demanding fast pace productive company but over all it's a very good company to work for. I learned about shipping and receiving products on a RF scanner and how to recognize the products by scanning the bar codes, it would show me the name of the product/title. I had to make sure that the product and the title matched before receiving it on the RFscanner. Some of the management were understandable and they gave you an opportunity to know the job. Some of the co-workers were team oriented and made the work environment a good place to work at. The hardest part of the job was when they had mandatory work hours of up to 10 hours a day for peak season."
good,Trabalho em si é muito bom só que a empresa precisa valorizar mais seus colaboradores principalmente os inspetores
good,"While this company emphasizes the customer experience, it really does not value the employee experience. If you are among the 75% that are doing the daily heavy ""lifting"" (stow, receive, pack, sort, etc) then you are required to work long hours, subjected to mandatory overtime year round, work above hours on concrete floors, have to factor walking time into your 2 15 minute breaks (breakroom is at least 3 minutes away from work areas so your break is really about 9 minutes). Unless you have IT skills, managerial skills really need the paycheck or just want benefits this is a dead end. If you have to come in through the temporary staffing agency (Integrity) then you are also subjected to their ridiculous ""trainers"" that do not know a thing. This is a good first step job, learn what you can and move on."
good,very productive but they do not care about their employees at all.
good,The hardest part of the job was standing on my feet for 12 hours for 5 days straight.
good,"Lo mismo anteriormente expresado. Casi se forma una rutina diaria, el director general y mis colegas siempre responsables. Pero con un ambiente que provoca calor."
good,Normal. Ambiente no muy aireado. Casi formando una rutina. Si se aprende nuevas cosas cada día. El gerente trabaja muy bien y es responsable. Las personas también. En realidad lo difícil es trabajar con mucho calor y no hay buena capacitación para desempeñar nuestras funciones y lo que más me gusto es aprender sobre el rubro.
good,Analyze issues and generate reports
good,could be a fun place to work unfortunately to many communication errors top to bottom.
good,I would not recommend the Area Manager position to anyone. Senior leadership is horrible and they work you upwards of 90 hours per week. Very political environment.
good,"i worked night shifts which were quite different i expect to a afternoon or morning shift, learned quite alot regarding the packing side of things, and the management were quite helpful and really nice, co workers were amazing and the hardest part of job was standing in same spot for 8 hrs which in time got easier, also the 30 minute break was never enough by the time you queued to get out and searched you would have literally 15 mins to eat drink and get back to production line"
good,"Os colegas de trabalho era muito bom de trabalha com eles o dia tipico de trabalho era ver as pessoa do dia dia .A direção não era muito boa , por que eu pretava serviço ao estado."
good,"Working in the photography studio at Amazon has been an excellent experience. If you want to advance, it is up to you. I've learn a lot of problem solving."
good,"Training in abundance & job security good in local area, but down side is that shift change is regular & often without much notice."
good,"Good for fast paced work as long as you have good managers, long 10-12 hour days, good co-workers,"
good,I was there such a short time. Nov.16th to Dec.28th of 2012.
good,*On your feet moving around at a rapid pace
good,"Decent job if you need one, however, long hours and rough work environment make it difficult to be eager to work. Easy work though."
good,When I start work I always want to do my best and show what I can achieve. Within 5 weeks I was made a Ambassador and still wanting to learn more. I work well to targets and deadlines and achieve my goals. Improvements can be made but needs to be taken to highest level within the company to make the business thrive. I made a couple of thoughts to help the company be more efficient. I always thought that being efficient gives more to productivity and I do my best to see this within any company I work for.
good,typical day in work would be learning somthing new everyday
good,My day would start at 6;30am. I would get the 7:30am train to Cork and then get the bus from Cork bus station to the Airport Business Park. Work started a 9pm and finished at 5pm. My work shift changed monthly and I was often required to start later and finish later depending on what shift I had been allocated.
good,My typical day I scan and look at custome order to make sure the item they order are not damage then I pack package that customer order to be shiped out.My work has a rate we have to have so many package out in a hour. I have learn how to do a lot more on the computer.I have been a part of a team on training new people.I have work with a lot great people.i have work in proble solve kick outs.Working with all kind of people.
good,Fun place to work great coworkers but HR is a joke. Being on the phone 8 hours a day is a little boring but Amazon makes it fun.
good,Good Company.
good,"Working for Amazon UK was an interesting start to getting into work, as there was a lot of physical exercise but very little time to enjoy yourself, as the breaks didn't give you much time to eat lunch."
good,Typical day in average:
good,Long Hours: Short Breaks
good,My typical day at work was get orders sort them and make sure the go in the right boxes. I learned not to mess up orders cuase you would rated on based how you work. The hardest part of the job was working 12 hours and i recently was in a car accident which i mess my knee up bad and i had to stand on the whole time. the most enjoyable part of the job was clock out and get paid for working almost 60 hours a week good pay.
good,walk 20 to 25 miles daily around the warehouse collecting customer orders
good,Days went by fast. People were nice and friendly. Not alot of pressure and there was always something to do.
good,"place to work and get paid, good hours, not a hard job, mostly good co-workers"
good,"A good job, but not a career choice. No chance to grow or branch out."
good,It was ok to work there to begin with but they had alot of annoying people to work with or at least try.
good,"Very difficult on your body and the long hours are not a joke, it is a stressful job that not many can do."
good,Typical day at at work: Load and sort boxes.
good,"aprendi muito,não só com a empresa que me contratou como também com todos que estavam a minha volta,"
good,"As a picker, you definitely are walking the full time of the shift, up to 20 miles a day, especially during peak season. Always needing to keep on top of your rate for items to get out on time to the trucks. Not a real ""fun"" place to work, but it's good pay, and if you are hired as an amazonian, the benefits are pretty good."
good,"all kinds of processing jobs for amazon.com like shipping, receiving, packing, picking"
good,1.patrolling warehouse
good,The people i worked with was friendly .. although the manager was bit harsh i think. I done quite a lot of boxes in a hour and they had a go at me even thoe i was working faster than most of the people around me.
good,"They don't care about notting that is not productivity,"
good,This work place is very demanding and not much considerate.
good,They want you to work hard and not contented when you reach your percent they always wants more more more. No security they can fire you anytime.
good,"FLT driver, the role was good and I found it interesting."
good,I wouldn't recommend this job to any who has athma or any health problems because it is still under going construction.
good,"Laid back atmosphere, Long hours, Busy company. Pay is good for the work you will do."
good,Amazon is a good place to work if your kids are grown or if you have any. the hours you spend in there are long. But overall good place to work!!!!!!!
good,"Everything is automated so better be on time always for break inclusive, Very fast paced , physical job. multicultural. Canteen on site decent and cheap."
good,Picking and scanning was the hardest part of the job but they would move staff around to do other roles on the job so that everyone got a chance to perform other tasks.
good,"A day at amazon was lots of standing, scanning boxes and operating the forklift when needed overall amazon was a diverse work place interesting place to work!"
good,You pick merchandise at your own risk n pase and also you spend the whole shift walking n picking no one bothering you unless you do something wrong it’s a okay job.
good,"As a Fulfilment Associate, you are rotated between job roles, this can be picking, packing, rebin, stowing, waterspider (restock), AR technician, fire marshal and general maintenance of the work space. "
good,"I really didn’t enjoy it after week 2, because my work schedule made it super hard to get proper sleep. Barely had time to sleep, eat something and bathe, then it was super hard on my body."
good,Overall i would grade the experience of working as a Delivery Associate for Amazon as a B-.  Learning to drive the vans and getting to know the other drivers was fun. But unfortunately they laid us off.
good,"Provides work tools"
good,"motive et respecte les employés ,bonne  comprehension"
good,"The place is great to work at for the first couple of years but the expectation versus reality is far, if not, non-existent. Management there feel more as if they follow what their computers tell them versus what is humane. But I guess I have learned a bit about how to manage correctly to where everyone is on the same page instead of striking fear into them."
good,It wasn’t really that hard . just tediously . and packeting the trucks in the morning are annoying but someone tge drivers don’t want it to be like how you put the bags and boxes.
good,The job is ok but overtime is needed to survive and they rarely offer it. They spend more time giving you days off than actually letting you work over time. This job is better for someone that is a student or a younger person with not alot of responsibilities
good,"Don't really recommend the job, physically overworked. A weird work environment don't talk to anyone, kinda seems like they have favorites, not worth the hassel"
good,"Mediocre at best, The work life almost consumes all of your time. You go in when the suns down, you come out when the suns down. Even with 4 day work weeks, if you are not careful the people and atmosphere will wear you down considerably."
good,"if you have back, or leg pain i do not suggest."
good,"Temporary...."
good,You will have strict time deadlines and long hours to work. Short breaks tough to balance work and home life. I don't reccomend worki6for this company.
good,They fired me because they lost paperwork 3 separate times so the medical leave they forced me on got denied. which caused me to have -200 something hours.
good,I was on a team for several years and then then they started to move resources to other areas and what had been a dynamic and motived team languished and became kind of a dead end
good,Long hours and tons of overtime but good job security if you are productive. Plenty of opportunity for job growth. Good job to gain warehouse work experience.
good,its fine working there when everything is in order and beyond knows what they are doing its a really great company to wok fo has a lot of befits for you.
good,"The job was ok, though it had its perks. The people there were pretty great most of the time and always focused on safety. The Benefits were fine and it was nice to have insurance."
good,I LIKE THE WORKING SYSTEM  IN AMAZON . AMAZON  follows  rating system.  AMAZON provides good  salary  and health benefits  to hire people's ....?.....?...................................
good,unload trucks from the docks make sure warehouse is clean pick product from bin and put them in the correct area stock product in correct bin make sure my rate is average or above
good,"Ambiente Stupendo, Il lavoro interessante e dinamico."
good,"Its nice company to chill and work, but salary is very low, ANd the work pressure is very less, there is no timing also. You can have flexible work timings."
good,"The working environment is fast paced extremely busy and hardly stops once the shift begins. Personal targets in every department are pre-set and monitored on a daily basis and can be difficult to reach."
good,"There is excellent safety facility and job timing. I have worked there 2 years but there also feel some physical pressure."
good,The job is good for people who don’t mind not having any conversation or change of scenery within a 10 hour period. I worked in the hazmat section and walked around in a circle for 10 hours a night.
good,Company Culture is great. fast pace changes. competitive. some times top management is biased with employee and favoritism takes place. Over all amazon is great to work for
good,"Pay is good, there is a rate you have to have at the end of the day, meet some cool people, work ten hours a day four days a week, easy job it's just hard to stay on rate if your new to it"
good,average warehouse experience if you don't mind working hard you will be fine. I don't have anything negative to say about my experience at amazon. have a great day
good,"Amazon was an ok place to work. The work place was very clean and they made sure we had all the gear for the winter time. When there was down time we had to work in the warehouse, which wasn’t a bad thing. Management was ok but one manager always seem to have an attitude. They do need to work on telling the employees at the end of the peek season when our last day was going to be, instead of waiting until the day of to let everyone go."
good,Good company the Are very persistent about Ray and quality more over quality I believe that Amazon will get you where you need to be if you have a long time ago in life and I feel that if you need any type of helping at work their leaders that can help you and just have a positive attitude
good,"Ambiente stimolante e colleghi bravissimi "
good,The job is almost as even as most jobs. Does not work with those not looking for a job but a career. Has a diversity in the work force. Favoristism is what is causing a lot of people to leave.
good,Der Job ist sehr stressig und anstregend jedoch ist das Gehalt in Ordnung
good,"Great place to learn, but you are expected to do so largely on your own and with little guidance. Sink or swim. I have seen quite a bit of poor management with few true strong people managers. This leads to over commitment of teams, over work, and burn out of staff."
good,"Not a bad place to work, money is good and managers do all they can to help. The job is what you make it, work hard you will get on fine. Good canteen"
good,"Good temp to hire job to work, however they have certain things that need to be altered. Their not felony friendly which can be a problem in today's society."
good,"The people in my department and my manager were wonderful to work with. Unfortunately their tasks were complicated by a lack of support from Amazon itself. I was only a temp, but I could see that the regular employees were frustrated."
good,"I got stuck on the stow floor and my day consisted of 10hr shifts stowing and putting merchandise into bins. Amazon has a quota you need to meet or exceed every day and it's quite rigorous. It's an achievable number no doubt, but can be quite a challenge depending on the type of merchandise or when people play favoritism and disregard the balance of merchandise - for example instead of getting a load of small, medium, large as intended by company policy some people play favorite and get loads customized for greater stow percentile such as getting loads of small, medium or just small - leaving others around them with loads compromised of medium, large, or just large which completely screws you over. I think the rate was something like 13 pieces a minute, 750-780+ pieces an hour, 7,500+ pieces a shift. "
good,"It is a good place to work if you are not working via the agency as they are cutting your hours straight after the Christmas, asking you to come and once you show up telling you that you are not needed so by bye."
good,"The various job duties all require light physical activity that must be sustained for hours.  The mental load is light.  The job is repetitive, which is good or bad depending on the employee.  People are around the warehouse, but the time to talk with others is very limited."
good,"I would not work at Amazon again. simply because of the heavy lifting. Overall, at the Amazon that I worked at was mostly fair, as there were a few problems, But it was fun and very festive at that time."
good,We could definitely get paid more . Some companies do depending on the owner. The pay is weekly which is lovely. The management can be a little iffy but it’s a good job
good,"Very long hours. There was a lot of favoritism here. You only got better job benefits if you were close to anyone in management. I was always a hard worker but because I wasnt cool enough, they never noticed me."
good,Good place to work. Great employees and nice environment to work in. There is plenty of opportunity to move up if you are considering having a long term career.
good,Definitely not an easy job but it gives a rewarding sense of accomplishment. They offer great benefits at an affordable rate for the family. Accommodating to life issues.
good,"If you will work in any company,,, you should get your rights to be better for you... I mean your benefits (your level, your position, your health insurance card and your salary."
good,Working at Amazon as a private contracted delivery driver was fun. They had a very flexible schedule and it was nice to be able to drive to different areas each time.
good,"I worked here for a few weeks, I was supposed to be working in inbound stowing but was moved to packing on my first day. I chose night shift, but did not realize how difficult it was going to be for me to work night shift having never worked it before. Overall, it isn't a bad job considering the pay if you can handle doing the same task for hours at a time with minimal resting time, but I definitely would have chosen a different shift or position if I could go back again."
good,Typical day at work is fast paced we walk in and start building into the shift right away get a hand off from prior shift and jump into managing upwords of 150 people. hardest part is losing time with the family and being called at all hours .
good,The work is challenging and sometimes rewarding. Management needs improvement but overall a great learning atmosphere and great company benefits! Opportunity to learn new things is sadly a rare occasion and Amazon prides itself only on in the best interests of the company!
good,"Opportunity to progress, however against a lot of competition. Embrace double standards when suits them. Team Leaders are usually very well liked people, however due to being under pressure the goals or targets can often be difficult to achieve."
good,"A pretty good place to work, pay above avg salary. Good team environment and many opportunities to move to other departments or move up if you want to."
good,"Stretching at standup talk where you will receive your assignment, and information of new and up coming events. Everyone is cross trained for every position. Each position has a hourly quota that must be reached. The hardest part of the job is the continuous standing and walking on concrete."
good,"Wasn't the most organized place to work ,the managers didn't seem to have their head screw on right,they showed favouritism in my eyes. The same people got routes everyday ,if you needed help , everybody was sending you to somebody else,they were hardly ever there"
good,"General population are friendly.  Managers/Leads are helpful and encourage productivity.  "
good,"Ive been in receive for over 2 years. It is really easy work. They work with your school schedule. It is hard to move up, even if you are a top performer. (Ive been a top performer ever since I was hired. I have proof) They seem to not care about how good you are, it is who you know there."
good,"I would always lead stretch at work, I was sometimes put in different roles. I was able to ask for assistance if needed. I also taught water spiders what there function was. I was also a Ambassador, and taught employees to be re-trained after an absence!"
good,The area manager position is not difficult in the content of the role. The hours and expectations are a challenge. The site leadership makes or breaks the site.
good,I worked on the outbound ship dock which is a very physically demanding job. The expectation is to get the trucks loaded in a fast and efficient manner as possible which is extremely challenging.
good,"The managers are great—professional and supportive. However I was treated rudely by the process assistants aka assistant managers. "
good,"It's not bad, just very repetitive and physical. It doesn't really require any brains, just speed. The people are nice, the benefits are expensive and the company should contribute more considering how low the pay is. A dedicated monkey who is fast could do this job."
good,"I enjoyed working with Bob Berney; Head of Theatrical Marketing and Distribution, but the studio head wanted him out along with the team he built which made no sense so unfortunately, I was not afforded the opportunity for conversion. Also, Diversity is somewhat of a joke."
good,Its an okay place to work at. You meet some nice people and the work sometimes can get fast paced and overbearing but most of the times it can be relaxing and you do get a good workout with all the boxes.
good,Managers only care about numbers to get their incentive each year and safety because they have too. They can care less about the employees and you will feel that over time however if you get a cool chill manager then you will love this job even tho it’s fast paced and hectic at times
good,ITS an ok job to have... standing on your feet for up to 12 hours a day. Breaks are short because by the time you get outside it's time to come right back in.
good,"The job isn't really bad but the work overload can be alot. Also they watch you alot like honestly like eagles as they would say but it's not all bad, the job can be really flexible and the people there are sort of nice and they try to take your opinion seriously and act on it."
good,"Very great place if you want to advance in a career with management"
good,"expected to do more than your required job role, did not have a social life, and often not paid right, long hours, equipment faulty, very tiring over Christmas period"
good,"Es gibt keine Gerechtigkeit bei der Beschäftigung von Arbeitnehmern, es gibt viele Arbeiter, die dort nicht ernsthaft arbeiten, aber sie haben einen unbefristeten Arbeitsvertrag erhalten !!!"
good,"L'univers d'Amazon est très centré sur la sécurité mais aussi sur la productivité."
good,"Your job is based on performance(quality and quantity) "
good,"This job is great "
good,Non male ci sono spazi per tutti il caffè offerto e tutti collaborano per un risultato finale
good,I personally think amazon can do better like all. Jobs also learn how to interact with staff better be more understanding if staff feel that they are unfairly treated also give staff better training so they can grow into job roll also take time out to ask staff how they could help. Them progress also agencies who are employed by amazon need to be more understanding to staff needs aswell as amazon
good,"Amazon has great medical, dental and vision. They offer 401k and even give you parental (paternal and maternal) leave. They also have a Career Choice program which pays 95% of your college (2 year degree and only select degrees) tuition. The pay isn't bad at all, and they give you a lot of time off so long as you manage it well. As far as the work goes, it's definitely a warehouse job. The main problem is management kept changing. I had cycled through 3-4 area managers in my 3 years there and 3 GMs as well. Some had experience, and some were fresh out of college (Area Managers)."
good,"A great place to work at, great management, and great employees, I would recommend people to work here and be prepared to work hard, and meet great people"
good,"PRO - Good place to work, time off as needed"
good,"The work can be exhausting, and you are expected to make rate."
good,It can be difficult to get extra time opportunities because they may only need one person for those specified hours. Only 29.9 hours is the max amount of hours a week before peak season.
good,"I am depressed so I had trouble meeting the quotas. The issue is that you have to identify the RIGHT barcode on a box that may have six. The right barcode may not even be on carton, you have to open some, that takes time. Even though you scan sometimes a wrong barcode and you DON:T commit it to database (you then scan right barcode), you still can earn negative feedback. You are ranked, finding my place among bottom 5% was depressing too."
good,The job was tough but rewarding if your aren’t lazy. I think it’s a great fall back job that anyone can do if they really need money since amazon seems to always be hiring
good,"Not a fan of the long , stressful days where nothing I do is never good enough. Really felt apart of the Amazon family while I was there... Also you need this to be 150 characters, so there!"
good,"	Delivery attempt and deliver packages that are assigned to you daily"
good,"Overall it was an easy place to work. Meeting the rate was the only stressful element, but they gave you tons of opportunities to fix it. Management was good and nice as long as you hit rate."
good,"Amazon has amazing benefits and opportunities available for their employees, but it’s not worth it in my opinion. You get paid more for working nights, and even more so working nights on weekends. Working nights on weekends makes you eligible for all pay and benefits the company has to offer unlike the other shifts, but you can say goodbye to your social life. Shifts are 10 hours and during peak they can ask you to stay for up to 11.5-12 hours and there are mandatory OT days if a quota is not met. Work is extremely easy and you learn very little there, so that makes for a miserable and boring shift as you are not allowed to bring your phone or headphones with you, which is realistic in a job despite how awful and boring the work is. You accrue vacation time, paid personal time off (PTO), and unpaid time off (UPT). You are paid biweekly and the weeks you aren’t paid, you instead are given 3 hours and some change in PTO, which you begin with 20 hours of when you start weekend night shifts. UPT is for emergencies, tardiness, etc and they do not like you using UPT even though they give it to you, and UPT is given quarterly and on top off that it can only be used by the other, for example 1 minute late equals 1 hour of UPT. The managers are extremely helpful and very nice, although from my experience I’ve gotten the impression that they only pretend to care about you as a person. Overall this job is decent if you don’t mind the long uneventful shifts."
good,It was a great little gig to work if you like to meet people and earn a little extra money. Just make sure your numbers is high and your on time and don’t have any problems with people and you will be awesome
good,It was great over all but I’m looking for something else. It is very unorganized and and independent.its not hands on at all.and the scheduling is not very good
good,"Lovely place to work at, difficult to get on full time if you sign up for part time. Not a lot of advancement opportunity unless you're a blue badge employee."
good,Amazon is a good place to start out they have good employee benefits and casual work culture. Timining can be an issue because they serve all around the globe.
good,"It seems that the PAs have their little favorites and they are the ones who get put in line for promotions. Also put break schedule is wack: one hour into shift and we get out first break then two hours later lunch, leaving a longer period after lunch till we go home."
good,"""Work environment (the environment is good at Amazon when compared to many other companies)"""
good,nothing really to say.... other than it was easy job to get and in a good location from my home. i would recommend if friend cant find a better job not my first recommendation for anyone.
good,"Transaction Risk Management Systems (TRMS) at Amazon is a one of a kind fraud-protection unit that ensures every eCommerce transaction is trusted, safe and protected from fraud."
good,I learned a lot working at Amazon. Stay close to managers and hard working employees. The will help you if you ask for it. Avoid lazy employees because they will have a negative effect on you.
good,It was stressful trying to keep up with rate and they would eyeball you all the time. I was normally uncomfortable and the amount of stress was causing my mood to change and such. The problem solvers weren’t bad other than one who had an issue with everything. It wasn’t bad there just people and stress.
good,"New people are treated better then associates who have been there for years. Out with the old, in with the new policy. Not aloud to have relationships with anyone higher then the tier your on."
good,The pay does not reflect the cost of living in the area and it is physically demanding work. You are walking Miles a day. Area was in a rural like area with no nearby access to food places for lunch.
good,"changement de postes fréquent, bonne ambiance, bonne entente avec la hiérarchie"
good,"Job experience varies between buildings. Full time positions at fulfillment centers can be a nightmare,  especially around the holidays, while part time sort centers, while physically demanding, are pretty laid back atmosphere wise."
good,"Easy job but very boring "
good,Ottima organizzazione del lavoro ma poca prospettiva di carriera
good,"I really enjoyed working at Amazon but my hours were never secured depending on the workday flow I would get maybe 2 to 3 hours a day they would always offer VTO due to lack of work. People in charge would take advantage of there power, giving women who were flirty and loose more easier task to accomplish. Or they would purposefully leave you alone when the belts were full to capacity. Not to mention the many dangers of boxes flying off the conveyer belts at top speeds so many flew right off and caused injury."
good,"Ho lavorato presso Amazon nel globale e' molto buono in tutto! MANCA SOLO CHE ASSUMONO SOLO GENTE RACCOMANDATA E NON I MERITEVOLI.."
good,"Fast paced job, can scan packages incorrectly and receive error message on scanner. Receive feedback on job performance. Work with others to scan packages."
good,"U need to be really hardworking if u wanna last here. "
good,"Pay is good depending on the job that you do. Alot of hard labor, not easy to move up. Always want more out of workers. People are great to work with your always in a rush."
good,Amazon is a high-stress work environment. Managers will continuously pile on more work if it is deemed necessary for the company. Great place if putting your head down to work gives you satisfaction. Not a great place if a social environment is what you like.
good,A typical day would be clocking in to the assigned shift and stretching. I learned the importance of organization at Amazon. The hardest part of the job would be walking and standing for long periods of time.
good,"I worked at Amazon's customer service call center in 2013. I was only there for a few months because I had a long commute and worked 10-hour shifts, and having to deal with being away from home for 14+ hours every day was too difficult to continue."
good,It is hard to train in other things because there is a lot of favoritism that takes place. HR doesn't really seem to care about anything and they don't really help you when you need it.
good,"Slow paced."
good,"The managers really don’t care about your health or safety. They also have favoritisms and it shows. If other people don’t want to work , you have to pick up your work and their slack as well. People come in complaining and leave complaining . The pay is great but the workplace isn’t so great ."
good,"It's not a bad place to work especially as a warehousing job, if you don't think to much into the task itself . the job descriptions are very black and white nothing more nothing less.moving up is difficult and when it happens within the fulfillment centers its rather rare, most are hired from the outside and don't have any leadership skills.. the job can be very cyclical meaning the same task day and day out, 4 days a week, 10 hours a shift and like this for month after months, so you really have to like this kind of job and find happy moments or you can fall into mental repetitive traps. "
good,"An sich n guter Arbeitsplatz leider verlangt Amazon Aufgrund der Tatsache U.S. Unternehmen Akkord Arbeit wer nicht Packt fliegt raus Hire&Fire war für mich als Security mal ne neue Erfahrung als Picker zu Arbeiten Anfangs viel spass gemacht gute Leute grösstenteils ab und zu paar kriminelle dabe, aber naja is bei dem niveau wohl so. Über 500 items pro hz schicht das hart vor allem wennein batch mit einem item voll ist. Nich 300 kl. Usb fire sticks.....geht nicht immer und 3 fusdballfelder jeden tag mehrmals abrennen is auch nich so doll."
good,"Very good job with excellent benefits, and good hours the work was easy to learn and soak in. and advancement in the company is very satisfying but due to my experience management can be a lot better. Very unprofessional and unorganized."
good,E una azienda seria dove si lavora molto e c’è anche molta cooperazione ma soprattutto un buon abito lavorativo al livello di clima.
good,The job requires workers to maintain a high production rate for the entirety of their shift. You will be reprimanded if production slows down. Amazon takes care of its employees with full health coverage from day one along with employee benefits.
good,na My working at Amazon is a position job with all the ant-acts  that come with people places and things.   its personal to me and not out there for viewing
good,"Great Job ,  Very busy . Pay could have been better. Great Health Insurance and benefits. Holiday Season expect to work 7 days a week. "
good,"Good payrate, but big pressure on employee. Only night shifts, so bad balance with personal life. And very disgusting stay in stand by, it means that you don't work but must stay and wait if they want to call to work i must be there."
good,Very good place to work but you are not appropriated for your work and they don't seems to bother if you're a good worker or not. Job security is very low you might never know when they will let you go
good,they try to make it tolerable. mindless work that involves lifting a lot of dog food and cat litter. they give you treats if you stay all day. the pay is pretty good.
good,"I really enjoyed working for amazon, it is a great company. Easy face paced job, pay is decent. I would recommend a family member. Just the Managers get changed a lot."
good,"Middle management gets paid the same regardless of which type of building you work at. If you’re lucky enough to get into a building that has support on site (hr, safety, learning) your job will be easier. "
good,Management wasn’t very professional. We were told that the job was a 11month program after being there for almost a year. They don’t appreciate your hard work.
good,"Very productive job, Very nice culture and people. All the way from different lifes and parts of the world, met very awesome people. But, it is all run by computers and technology which is the worst part of the job."
good,"I enjoy the position most of the time but many times the time block that you are on takes much more time than stated in the app.  Even if you work 2 hours over the app time period you do not get paid for the extra time for the improper judgement of the route.  "
good,"Amazon is a nice place to work. Must work the overtime during peak season and its alot of hours"
good,be mentally prepared to answer lots of customer call related to all situations. Must be very patient and a good listener. willing to show empathy at all times and think outside the box. be open to understanding customers and abusive ones as well.
good,"A good company to work with, very smart work ethics and there are opportunities to progress and good professional work environment, Health and safety reg"
good,"Their turnover rate sucks and they work there employees like slaves,bathroom brakes are timed but the bathrooms are at least 5 minutes away. Amazon really think people are robots,wait actually they treat the robots better they get AC"
good,"Long hours and limited work life balance, compensations is quite good, decent amount of learning if you are part of a good team. Management can be demanding at times, top-down organization. Upper management is a cozy club of alumni from Tier-1 schools."
good,"I was fired after having received a schedule change that I was not notified about and missed days I was never told to work. It was blamed on me for not checking my schedule on a separate website. The only reason I did not, was because they had already altered my shift twice (Once for regular over time, and another because I FINALLY received a transfer of shift after a year."
good,"You can build a great career here, but you will probably forget how to do everything you were once an expert at once you get here. A lot of learning, re-learning, followed by continual learning will occur."
good,"Good place to get warehouse experience, but not the best place to start trying to make a career. friendly people, but some are just there to work then get home."
good,You are able to schedule your own hours daily. Its a good match for anyone who needs to supplement their income and needs flexible hours. Sometime the hours you need are not available every week.
good,The work is fast paced but employees are encouraged. They do over staff and set goals to eliminate the overage. I found that men in general were given heavier lifting jobs regardless of ability than women. They are unreasonable in finding a position suitable for your abilities if you have a disability and find you cannot fully perform your assigned roles per quota.
good,Always put your best effort everyday with everything you do with making sure the customer needs is being meet and orders is out on time everyday without missing orders.
good,"The temperature was and they don't plan on getting any new fans. I couldn't accept the rate system because I'm not a robot."
good,Great company but I was with the wrong third party company. Benefits are great and the warehouse is great with plenty of snacks. If you like delivery this is great
good,"Amazon has an high level of customer satisfaction.  The recruitment teams work hard to attain forecasted number of employees per shifts and days. Number one priority is stretches done at the begginng of each of the shifts. Emphasis on employees having bottled water to avoid dehydration is heavily emphasized.  Also, ongoing reminders of safety habits are emphasized such as proper lifting of packages, walking in designated areas, how to evaluate the warehouse and where to me outside, etc.. Management surpises employees with nice gifts for job performances for a variety of tasks. Gifts are great and popular such as televisions, laptops, tablets, coffee and store gift certificates, etc.. Especially during ""peak times"" employees are treated with snacks, lunch, liquids, fruits, etc.."
good,"I've been working at Amazon for about 2 years.  "
good,"I started Amazon as a Prime Now Associate in Cupertino when it first opened in the Bay Area. The supervisors and coworkers are friendly and fun; it was the only reason why I kept going back. Management barely know how to answer questions and always refer to HR. HR doesn't know all the answers and would refer that you go on the Amazon Hub website..  If you plan on working for extra cash, then it's the job for you. If you wanted to advance or try to do full time, don't even try. They have a schedule drop, in which you pick your schedule on the days you want to work on a certain time they have. Sometimes you can get it, other times you won't. It's frustrating sometimes, but it's mostly for part time."
good,"The pay increase to $15 was nice, however, those that have been there for a while make the same amount as those just starting out. My nearly 4 years experience should offer me more than someone just hired. They care little about the stress of the job and about the verbal abuse that a lot of customer service agents have to deal with. It's a very soul crushing job with very little recognition of a job well done."
good,Management is not the greatest. The AMs do not discuss matters with the PAs so half the time no one knows whats going on. The favoritism with certain employees by managers is ridiculous and causes tension between all the employees. HR is a joke and the ERC is even worse. AM care can't really do anything for you other than give you an ice pack.
good,"It’s a fine job to work for since they give you PTO but you have to work hours to receive PTO hours. The managers all differ, you might have a chill manager or you might have a hardass one"
good,"Ce ne sont pas tant les horaires en 2/8 que les cadences imposées, et les difficultés pour se rendre au travail  quand on vous demande de commencer 1h plus tôt... L'accord entre Ametis et Amazon ne va pas si loin... Bien sûr on vous propose le covoiturage, mais par expérience, 1h de marche avant de rejoindre le chauffeur pour 1 journée de travail intensif, ça passe pendant 3 jours, et le 4ème, on est épuisé... Résultat, le médecin vous trouve une tension trop basse, vous met en At et à 50 ans, on a l'impression de n'être plus bon à rien. Sans parler de l'attitude de la boîte d'interim qui est votre réel employeur et n'est pas là pour vous aider mais pour se faire bien voir d'Amazon."
good,"You have to keep on your feet and have a constant flow. The shorter shifts go by in no time, but longer than 8 hours and you'll be burnt out in no time."
good,It’s a good paying and fast job to handle but it’s a good company and I will recommend othe rto work there if they like to drive and deliver people stuff
good,"As picker it's hard you have good day and met you rate and someday you don't and can get wrote up for not make your numbers  and when you get hired they don't tell lwhat is your job is until you are in orientation  and it may not be a fit for you ,because everyone is not a picker,don't match some people with the rightjob postion.And it could be challenging  for a person."
good,Working from home is a challenge and working with Amazon pushes every boundary. I could field anywhere from 10-30 calls a day. Pay could have been a little more competitive.
good,Too many clicks and too much favoritism you show up bust your rear and do not get recognized . No teamwork . Management is poor all they worry about is numbers and how fast to complete unsafe work . no guarantees on hours worked .Run away .Corporate Greed America. All about themselves and not associate.
good,"bring fresh ideas to the table "
good,Amazon is a place that sincerely Aims to make sure that the customers are served quickly and accurately and love for the employees is just not therea lot of the management are young college kids that don't maturely handle their position
good,"Typical warehouse that doesn't completely suck but isn't a forever job. Lots of training that I can use anywhere so that's nice. If you apply yourself and make it clear you're willing to train, they will teach you tons. Pay was ok but it was a lot of work sometimes and pace was particularly hectic. Some employees would game the system to hit productivity numbers, screwing everyone else."
good,Amazon is a good place to learn warehouse dealings and new tools of technology. The industry of amazon changes day by day. They offer many opportunities in different career areas.
good,Like the title say but everything changed when we got some manager the never managed a warehouse. The messed everything up. There was stress we're it shouldn't be. Weh. It was peak season the expected up to hit that rate even pass peak. Wich was impossible since there wasn't any work at the time
good,Growing industry.... much growth available along with expansion into new markets. Great opportunity for energetic individuals who enjoy moving at a fast pace.
good,"* fast pace"
good,"My experience was that they are very reactive, and not proactive.  Wanted a lot of production for very little pay.  I hear the pay has increased since I worked there though."
good,"Amazon was a productive and fun place to work at, but management could use a little help. Most of them are new to the management position. Also they move you around a lot depending on if your area is full which can be frustrating."
good,In my experience i Had great managers there. Really no dress code. You get alot of hours around holidays.fast pace. Always doing weird contests. Didnt have time to do nothing all you can do is work an sleep.
good,"As a corporate employee, you used be offered a more flexible schedule but productivity has become the main focal point instead of career growth opportunities provided from management."
good,"My typical role at Amazon is a Sorter. Sorters are charged with working at their assigned aisles and stow packages to their correct locations. Associates must maintain a rate of 180 per hour (3 packages per minute, though some days there are exceptions such as if the truck is late, low volume, or technical issues)"
good,"As with any large corporation, your experience at Amazon will greatly differ depending on the team you are on -- even different locales of the same global team will provide a greatly different day-to-day experience."
good,Starts with great pay but definetly do not have work life balance at this site. I have enjoyed the challenges and have grown signifigantly as a manger.
good,"The career choice program is a great benefit. This is why I initially got started with this company. After one year of employment, they will pre pay your tuition in a field of your choosing."
good,A nice place to work for a little while advancing your other Carter goals or looking into an actual professional career path but personally I wouldn't stay longer than necessary.
good,"a typical work day is long and constantly on your feet for the entire shift, you are offered multiple breaks during the course of the shift. Management, depending on the manager are very courteous, enthusiastic and motivating."
good,"Pretty much a fast paced, generic warehouse job. I enjoyed my time there a bit; there was constantly something to do, most of the employees were nice. My only issue was management. The first manager I had was pretty good. She didn't talk too much but she knew how to keep employees in line and would help you out when you needed. We were constantly getting managers switched, however. Only kept the first one for a few months. The next couple were mixed from great to annoting due to not really knowing how to deal with certain issues very well."
good,"To much micro management. not enough unpaid time off. Long days and even longer during the last 3 months. By the time you get to the lunch room its just about time to get back on the floor."
good,"I worked from home so of course that’s a plus. Training was long, almost two full months, but it is paid. I was a shipping and delivery support agent, assisting drivers and customers. Technology and/or software wasn’t reliable and overtime was mandatory and sprung on you out the blue.  We had to literally bid on a schedule every 4 to 6 weeks and there’s no guarantee you’ll get the schedule you bid on. You may work overnight one month and during the day the next month. You could take off whenever you wanted as long as you accumulated enough unpaid time off credits or hours to cover your absence  which you earn by working and volunteering for overtime."
good,"If you are not used to warehouse work and making rates, it may not be the place for you, however, it is a good place to gain the ability to move up if you so desire by putting in hard work"
good,"Typically you can expect a work day to last anywhere from 12.5-16 hours depending on the time of year. For example, Peak is when we ship the most items and will typically be required to work additional hours to ensure there are no customer misses. The job is a grind but is rewarding in the long run."
good,"The job is lifeless. It’s funny it’s called a fulfillment center bc there’s nothing fulfilling about it. "
good,"Wasnt the worst ive had bit it was pretty bad, long hours, days and nights, hardly any breaks inbetween fifteen mins at the most but you do get free tea and coffee."
good,"Let me start by saying that I left Amazon in 2018, So things may have changed since I quit.  My schedule was a schedule that I selected.  I worked for 4 days for 10 hours a day.  I would not recommend this schedule for anyone working at Amazon.  The job itself becomes easy over time, but the customers are the worst! Even if you solved their problems, they were never satisfied which made the job so hard sometimes.  The workplace is fun and informative.  Once you are selected for the seasonal position during Christmas, you are trained to handle customers from November through January. You are placed on teams during this time, and through chat and meetings; you are guided on how to help customers.  This part of the job is very face-paced, but it is fun because the managers are really helpful and supportive.  After the peak season, management makes its selections. This is when you are allowed to choose your schedule.  One of the reasons I left is because you can't change your status of full-time to part-time once you have selected that position.  The only way to change that status is to provide proof of your college schedule.  You do have the opportunity to change your schedule every 6 months.  Also, you will be moved to different departments once you have completed a year on the floor. There are some great perks to this job.  You receive bonuses, gift cards, and discounts.  However, the downside to this is that you almost lose yourself trying to achieve this status.  Amazon has a metric system that requires you to receive a survey after every call you receive.  The customer will"
good,"POSITIFS"
good,"The job itself wasn't too difficult, but the policies and the leadership methodologies they want you to force yourself into leave a lot to be desired. The work hours which are minimum 12 hours per day for managers...minimum, and four days per week seemed like a good idea at first.  But giving up a Saturday when your family has weekends off just isn't palatable.  Works for some...not for others."
good,"Good for an immediate job, but the chance of permanency from a seasonal position is entirely competitive. You must meet a preset rate as a stower/picker/etc. to be considered for a permanent position with manager recommendation."
good,Amazon delivery services are outsourced to multiple delivery companies. The crucial part of the whole operation is performed by the delivery agents and the salary packages and benefits are not in par with it.
good,"I would come in the morning at 6 A.M. then I would get a walkie talkie and a commander. These two supplies I needed every day when I would come in for work. Then I would do my rounds making sure the place is secured. Checking if all the trailer doors were locked when supposed to be locked.  Then I would check the bathrooms for any graffiti. If there was any graffiti, I would have to write it up and make sure maintenance  would come and clean it. In case of an emergency and the alarms would ring, everyone, but the security guards would have to stay in and check the entire building within a timely matter and make sure everyone is evacuating the building while we check the premises. After the rounds are clear, I would come back to the front desk and wait until the breaks come up so we can check the metal detectors if they ring. No phones would be allowed inside the warehouse or any electronics. The entire job has to ensure that we are always aware of every surrounding and keeping track of the cameras."
good,If you are looking for a great job around the Christmas time and make some awesome money with overtime then this is place to work. This is a temp to hire with cases or direct hire
good,Amazon values their employees. During peak season they have give always. The general manager is always available to help and answer questions. Benefits start up on your first day of work.
good,"J’ai pas d’avis personnel,les chauffeurs sont,mais mal équiper.Sinon il faudrait salairiser tous les jours."
good,Manager have favoritisms in workplace. Some people do whatever they want instead of following rules. Not a lot of supervision. HR are the best. Schedule flexibility.
good,"Work hard to keep your overall rate good, being on your feet all day with only 2 15 minute breaks with the lunch, while it is 12 hour shifts. With all of the over time that is given, it is great on pay day but exhausting for the pay of 60 hour work weeks."
good,Beaucoup de points positif et négatif. Travaille intéressant.
good,"Not too bad. "
good,I liked working here im a very dedicated to my job if i have the opportunity to get a accepted for a driving position again i will always give my full potential
good,"Most of the positions include being on your feet for 10 + hours 4-5 days a week. If you aren't up for the physical aspect of the job, it's not for you. I came home the first few weeks and literally couldn't move. It was a great job if you don't mind being a mindless drone, striving to get as much done as possible."
good,"They micromanage and don't trust employees. You feel like your in prison with all the rules!! Not professional."
good,"- You just follow the scanner to your items, fill up & drop off. Repeat."
good,"It’s a job, it pays the bills! Over worked and under paid, no give when it comes to family emergencies/ family life. If you don’t have the time to cover it you have to work or get Fired. My kids never see me"
good,"was an okay place to work. sometimes their was a bit of a language barrier due to their being a lot of eastern european's whos first language was not english aside from that working there was fairly okay, the warehouse is very large to walk to your workstation takes a few minutes that is something which could be an inconvenience when taking your break you get 15 minutes and it takes a few minutes to walk out of the site and to then walk back in especially when everyone is running for the door and you have to go through security so sometimes your break can go from your usual 15 minutes into 5 minutes. the money is good if you're doing overtime you can in some cases get double your usual pay which can sometimes be around £10.50 so depending on how much overtime you do you could be getting paid £21 an hour."
good,"The hardest part of the job, would be the long hours standing , moving and lifting pallets. It can cause wear and tear on the body quickly. The best part about the job would be meeting great associates, it helps the day go by faster."
good,I was fired due to a lack in my order picking rate. If you dont hit 100 percent everyday you get wrote up. everything you do on the floor is timed and you need to race to your next pick location after every item pulled. If any issues arise or even if you need to use the restroom you are timed and communication with management during the issues are one way messages from your manager. people get in your way the timer runs out and you get flagged for wasting time. Not my kind of job. on breaks all managers stand by the exit of the break room rushing you out to get on the floor. sometimes they even watch you on your break.
good,Don’t be fooled by the $15 an hour. Unless you go straight to a full time job (which is only at a distribution center) you won’t be making any hours. They say 4hr shifts but will end up working only 3 for 4 days. All the managers are super nice and just most of the people working there in general are super nice but not a job if you’re trying to pay bills on time.
good,"easy work nice company, easy to advance. not too tedious, nice hours, decent benefits. friendly atmosphere, interesting enviroment, voluntary time off"
good,Amazon didn't have great pros or great cons. It was a decent job that always had you on your feet. It required some sweat work that received decent compensation. I wouldn't be able to complain too much about it.
good,It’s a workable Job when you apply the skills and training provided. The managers are nice and very easy to work with. Health insurance is no time provided.
good,"Management is nice, but the workload is cumbersome and repetitive. A high scan rate is preached about and if you do not keep the average scan rate, management will scold you. Be prepared to lift heavy packages."
good,"You will be asked to sign a confidential agreement disclosure, you are at will employee, nothing can be discussed outside work and they can fire you without explanation."
good,"You learn from the moment you sit down to the moment you realize it's time to go home. "
good,"Working for Amazon is a great way to enter the workforce. One can experience expectations of standard work procedures, safety guidelines, and the ability to advance ones position if you are driven. The company offers many programs for self improvement within the company and can pay for certain education fields through a career choice program."
good,"I don't really have much to say that hasn't already been mentioned. I'd recommend watching South Park season 22, episode 9, to explain in depth what goes on at an Amazon fulfillment center."
good,Management has ridiculous expectations and struggle to connect with their associates. Creates barriers with employee culture and leads to a lack of understanding that can at times hurt productivity.
good,"This is a good job for a student or someone wanting to earn a little extra money.  I wouldn't recommend it as a career choice."
good,"As managers"
good,"All in all it wasn't a bad experience for me. The hardest part was getting my feet adjusted to standing and walking around for 10 hours a day. I worked as a receiver and stower, which was handling and storing merchandise. The job itself was a piece of cake."
good,I worked continuously when there was work. Some times there was not enough freight so they send you home. Some of the employees were not very nice either. They actually caused problems with other employees. And the hr dept. took their sweet time in dealing with it. Then some of the employees were ok. A different environment if you are older. The young people talk terrible.
good,"It wasn't a bad place to work, but I did find some aspects of the job unhealthy, i.e. sitting at a desk for long hours. It could be stressful at times, but it was rare to face anything too difficult to deal with. Customers are always the worst part of customer service."
good,"Amazon is a fast paced, competitive environment with a roundabout of management. The company is every changing and nothing will ever become stagnant. To work here is to embark on an adventure that will involve a lot of skill and self management"
good,"A typical work day in amazon starts off with a fast pace. I learned that a positive disposition can make anyone do anything for you at work or in life in general, management could use some improvement as far as having better people skills seeing as how we work with over 100 associates. The workplace culture could use some updating, associates feel as though they do not have to listen to managers; I believe this is due to having managers not being as approachable or understanding when dealing with associates personal lives. the hardest part about the job is staying positive for 10 hrs, the equipment crashes frequently creating a frustrating work environment and pushing managers as well as associates over the edge a little bit. the most enjoyable part of the job are the extra events that HR puts together for the associates (family fun day, 4 year anniversary, etc)"
good,"Pretty much the same thing everyday, the breaks are short, the day usually drags by. Other than that, it’s not so bad. I would definitely  recommend it to college students."
good,Working at Amazon.com can be like a fast paced workout without being too straining. Most of the co-workers & managers were great. If you are self-motivated & a fast walker then this is a job for you.
good,"They now keep the hours of all the associates at less than 30 each week to reduce the benefits.  They have a voluntary time off arrangement that people can take, but it only increases the stress of everyone else there, as they have to pick up the burdens."
good,If you are looking for a part-time job with good benefits then Amazon is the place for you as long as you come in as a part-time employee and not as a temporary employee.
good,"Working at an Amazon warehouse is not an easy job. Training is very minimal and workflow can get confusing when management can't take the time to work with you. However, it is a job and they are always hiring. Plus, they do pay a decent warehouse rate and there is usually some voluntary overtime you can grab up."
good,"Great career builder"
good,its a fast pace working environment. woking there was fun but very stressful.. pay was not too impressive comprehend to the cost of living but it was ok
good,This place is so fast paced I never met with a supervisor once in the whole year I was working there. You literally go in and start picking/packing. Great for students.
good,"A typical work day was arriving 5 minutes before your shift and clocking in and going to stand-up. Stand is where the manger would give you a work assignment of scanning packages, unloading packages from trucks, pulling packages from belt and load packages on delivery trucks. I would typical scan packages, It was a difficult job at first but I learned to adapt to it. I learned the process on how amazon get their products to the consumers. I learned how to scan and sort packages. The management there was great, they would help you with anything you didn't understand, I got along with them well. The workplace culture was very upbeat, management played music on the speakers throughout the building, which made everyone  work great. The hardest part of the job was if you didn't scan a certain number of packages per hour you would get wrote up. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know new coworkers everyday."
good,"stressful, poor training. the people were vey helpful. but to start up with the government there train g was not yet up to pare the part "
good,"I work in a fulfillment sort center, not the website. The environment is pretty laidback, with generally polite and very diverse coworkers. Each one is different, but this is just at the one I work at."
good,Nice coworkers and fun atmosphere. Very big on safety and making sure everyone is equipped with the right training and tools in order to do their job correctly.
good,"When I signed up as a independent contractor, I was able to get work everyday, by receiving reserved blocks and all other days i was able  to wake up and grab work for that day but after about 10 months,  I was lucky to work 1 day."
good,"Overworked and underappreciated; not all leadership and cultures in each building are terrible; my first location inspired me to stay with the company forever; however, my last group of seniors has driven away all top performing managers due to lack of recognition, failing to promote from within, and withholding valuable feedback"
good,"I have worked at a sort center for a long time and have a love/hate relationship with the whole Amazon culture. On the surface they seem to be cutting edge and forward thinking, claiming you will have fun and make history but in reality it's just the same old nonsense. "
good,"emploi physique."
good,"Dog-eat-dog environment in many ways (and I don't mean because of their ""dog friendly"" environment). Director is almost non-communicative and very negative towards women. Also, despite best efforts, the director clearly was not a good communicator, and then would be very harsh to his managers and EA when they didn't understand what he intended to communicate (which he did poorly). Some people are great at what they do until they aren't anymore, and the director in this case was an example of someone who should've stayed a step or two lower. Team was great, brilliant, and fun to support. Amazon spends TONS of money on ""team building"" and entertainment for the groups to keep up morale."
good,I was sorted into Pick well I was not the fastest person and I kept getting written up. Friendly staff and great benefits but you have to be fast and quick on your feet otherwise its not meant for you.
good,"All Amazons are different. The Amazon in Twinsburg is only part time and during non peak season you only subject to working 15 hours a week. Its a great place friendly place to work. However, management has changed and is new to the company and come off very aggressive."
good,"The people at amazon always gave care and good vibes off. The work environment was stressful. 12 hours which you were to work nonstop unless on breaks. you had to wait until the break bell rung which might take 5 minutes to walk to the break room. 3 minutes to grab your snack, and had to be back at your spot before your break was over so that mean you had to walk 5 minutes early back. For a 15 minute break turns into 2 minutes easy. you got in trouble if you went to the bathroom sometimes and could possibly get a point. 12 hours barely getting a break on your feet the entire time. food not allowed on the floor. no music or anything to keep you calm while working."
good,I gained good work experience while working at Amazon. 10 hour long work shifts. You are always on your feet. Management was alright. We had periodic meetings that was very informing about what was going with the warehouse. It was long hard working hours but it gave me further insist on the in and out of a warehouse job and learned a few valuable lessons about team work.
good,"Management,favors to people they like"
good,"Amazon could be a great place to work, IF I did not have to contact the HR dept. every other day for missing time or improper Unpaid Time off taken. The ""management"" does not notice or recognize hard work/effort, they promote unqualified associates to titles that are undeserved. The recent lack of work is unmotivating.. ."
good,I was determined to enjoy my time at amazon.  I got my foot into a lot of different areas through being very determined. Trouble shooting the robots on the kiva floor was super fun. The pay was poor but I was not going to spend my days miserable.  My first manager was super to work with and he helped me excel.
good,it was a good workplace good money good benifits but you have to have alot of stanima to work there. it was exausting long days. it was extremely hard on my body.
good,"Hard driving culture that rewards those who play the game/put in the hours. Compensation is great, and more than other companies in Seattle, but burnout potential is also very high."
good,"Si sabes trabajar bajo presión se puede llevar bien, en general el trabajo esta bien."
good,I personally did not enjoy working here. But some seemed to enjoy it fairly well. My PA made me feel appreciated and actually tries to have a connection with the sort team.
good,"It was a decent place to work at, people there were friendly, got trained in various areas, problem solving, forklift driving, picking, dock PG, shopping clerk"
good,"Amazon,"
good,"Basiccly as work place as money are good is very good,but there is no team work not enought respect and NO opurtunities at all,a lot of promises and nothink else"
good,"If you absolutely need money, this is a good place to make a lot of it quickly and pretty easy. To be able to work here you have to be able to keep yourself entertained for hours as you will just be walking around with no one to talk to and nothing to really think about."
good,"picking and packing peoples orders "
good,I thought it was very stressful until I figured out how the set up for business accounts went. They change your manager all of the time. Some of them are awesome but a few are just ready to pounce and get you in trouble for anything. The other reps and managers are what made this place fun to work at. Some of their security policies are off the hook stupid. For example the whole world knows if its g-mail then .com is the ending. But if you don't make the customer say that the its a security violation and you get wrote up. I was bummed to lose the job but now that I have I feel better. It basically was a lot of stress for me.
good,Great place to work if you work hard and want to learn new things. Not so good if you have a family. I lived to far from where I worked and didn't get paid enough to move closer. Working for corporate projects was a great experience.
good,"Bueno pero necesita pagar un poco mas,y que el trabajo sea mas estable"
good,Good company to work with and us could win pieces for production like 25 dollar gas card or amazon fire kind. fast pace work pics. get a long with people is easy.
good,The company by itself is good. The only problem is management and on site HR. Some HR members don't know the meaning of their job. They do not know how to provide the necessary support and resources to the employees.
good,Good company but need to grant benefits to its part time employees.  Company need to offer at least 30 hours plus so employees can have a stable living arrangement.
good,amazon has lots of flex ability when comes to needing time to take care of personal issues.....work is sometimes a challenge and very stressful but a very fast pace you must make rate cause if you don't you get a written report and if you get three  they walk you out.
good,"You grow professionally, intellectually, and spiritually at AWS. However, this is at the cost of having a personal life and friendships outside of work.  You have limited time for outside interests, and time to just 'think'."
good,"This  is an okay place to work, honestly. I enjoyed the fast environment, but the hours and the compensation weren't really worth the amount of hauling ya had to do. I hurt my neck from bending over too much so I left."
good,"Amazon will hire anyone and everyone as long as you can walk and have a high school diploma/GED. however, the rates they expect new-hires to make are the same as fully experienced associates, and are frankly ridiculous even for those who have been employed for 6+ months. because of this, a new batch of associates will be brought in, and then more often than not, half will be fired about 3-4 weeks after they've started. If you can make rates and keep up a good work quality, then the only really difficult thing is being on your feet for 10 hours with absolutely no music. some managers will get onto you for talking while working if it affects your rates, but then they'll get onto anyone if it affects their rates because that's their job. if you need a job and think you can handle it, try Amazon."
good,"It's a lot of walking and standing, managers have favorites, it's hard on working parents and single parents during the holidays. The floor is a killer on your legs and knees buy very good shoes."
good,The associates are nice and always helpful upper management does not have open door policy changed managers to much and a lot of walking you definitely got your exercise
good,Gud place to work. Cold and safe environment place. There is so safety about everything for everyone. Every one are very friendly and helpful to everyone. I really enjoy working in amazon.
good,"La turnazione prevista permette di avere un buon equilibrio tra vita privata e lavoro."
good,Very Fast Paced and didnt have enough time for breaks! you would have overtime at last minute and they chose who they wanted to VTO (Volunteer time off)
good,I worked there a year and a little over a half and they were awful.. I never hated a place to work so much. They cared so little about the people and what goes on in their lives..
good,"typical day at work; come in clock in, attend morning meeting, log in scanner get a cart and start picking your items. I learned how to read shipping labels with personal information on it. Management was ok, you could never really tell who your manager was though. They showed some favoritism but hey oh well. Very diverse environment to work in, most enjoyable part was when they did VTO and payday."
good,"A typical day at work requires you to open box after box, all sizes, to determine whether each product is able to resell and what condition it is in as well as the package it comes in and remove all customer information. You are given a rate that was always easy to meet. They promise you opportunities for advancement but there is never anything available."
good,"Amazon is an amazing company but with that being said, they are so wrapped up in the company that they forget about the needs of the associates. Amazon can be unfair and some of the working conditions are unprofessional. A typical day consists of rushing and getting passed people to clock in then to rush to ""standup"" then have to rush to get to your exact station so you do not get Time Off Task. Work for 3 hours rush to get to lunch just to barely make it. Then rush back to your floor and station and repeat the process over again. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to walk down my floor, yell and motivate my peers around me. I loved to get them hype and pumped up, ready to take on the last gruesome hours of our shift head on and with a positive attitude."
good,"I worked at amazon for almost 5 years. I worked in every building at SDF, and performed every tier 1 role. Lower management does not make any more than regular employees. People who problem solve and lead departments as PGs are treated like garbage and worked to death for no extra pay. The only way to move up is to kiss up to management. I was offered a PA spot at a brand new warehouse and was promised compensation, only for them to tell me they ran out of money.... The managers are hit or miss; you either get an amazing one or a terrible one. Favoritism is abundant. You will walk for miles a day because they refuse to alter their picking process to make it easier on their pickers. Stock benefits and variable compensation have been taken away so they could give a $15 minimum wage. People who have been with the company for years make what people coming in off the street make; loyalty means nothing at this company. You will not be valued at this company whatsoever; you’re just a number. And if they don’t like you, they WILL find a way to get rid of you."
good,"Amazon focuses on leadership principles to drive the company and it's business.  My typical day is calendar management for 8+ hours, not very happy with management, the culture is great if you wok in a group, the hardest part is my career advancement and I love the people I work with."
good,"Easy work, but it is fast and physical! Training went too quick and most people in my training class could not hear the Training Manager. Amazon is excellent at delivering packages efficiently to it’s customers, but are truly disorganized when it comes to dealing with their employees. It’s just a chaotic mess, and you get a different answer on any questions asked, depending on who you talk to at the warehouse or ERC."
good,Nice job culture to work. But change of weekoffs and shifts every week almost.Due to that difficult to manage life balance.Good salary and Benifits in the company
good,"At the end of the day you always feel a lot pain/stress."
good,"It's fast pace. The supers supervisors are always available."
good,"Amazon was ok as a picker, but it wasn't for me. If you want to lose weight, this is the job for you. Constant walking. Reward for staying over when everyone else has left. Please make sure that you are at you position after break."
good,The management for Amazon is usually a recent college graduate. This is their first real job and it shows. The turnover rate for these roles are very high. They stress you out with manager rating and the pretense of stock options you will never get due to most of them not making it to year 2. Then you deal with the pressure the manager feels as a tier 1 or 3 as they are stressed and overworked staying at the FC for 14 hours.
good,"This job is perfect for you if you are used to a fast paced hard labor environment. The location in St.Louis,MO only offers part time schedules, but “encourages you to work full time hours” with no benefits. You have to scan all packages in before you can leave for the day even if that means working overtime! Everyone is very friendly and you can advance pretty quickly if you are meeting scan rates and numbers.Overall it’s a decent job if this is what you are used to, but wasn’t the job for me."
good,"Overall the company is ok, for a part-time experience. Working can be exhausting, must take breaks as requested. Use the discounts that are given to you as an employee."
good,"Hard fast paced work, really nice people, plenty of accommodations for employees. Holiday meals provided by management. Food, games, tv's, refrigerators, microwaves, literally everything."
good,temporally my work is scanner  check the line ballet jack. trabajamos en equipo para sacar la mercancia a tiempo porque la compania lo require pero es un trabajo muy Bueno y divertido
good,"Didn't work for Amazon long, its ok very fast paced. Had to quit due to moving. The managers I worked with are very caring and were helpful if you had a issue."
good,A great company and  very upbeat for team work. The managers keeps the team energize when under pressure. Of course there will be ups and downs but what company does not have that.
good,"The 10 hour work days were long, and the only opportunity to even sit was at the breaks. The time spent walking to the break room was counted in the breaks, so a 15 minute break was more le a 10 minute break. However the rate at which they wanted work done was never impossible, or even difficult to achieve."
good,"Go just to do your job, you wont find friends there. You can learn a lot but growing there is not that easy, everybody wants the same so is very competitive and sabotage is real. Just go and do what you have to do without complaining to much cause as soon as they know what you hate, they will make you do that EVERYDAY. Don't show your weaknesses."
good,Was a good seasonal job. Not great for advancement or a career. The managers did not care too much about their employees and were too busy playing with reps who like liked.
good,"A typical day at work consist of warm ups, so we did not pull a muscle. Then we would load the trucks with products so the customers could get their packages at a timely manner. I also did bubble wrapping, which consist of wrapping packages in bubble wrap. I learned how to use a manual pallet jack. Overall I enjoyed the experience and learning new things."
good,Not bad place to work .They lay me off right at mine 90 days. They didnt call me and let me know i drove up there and couldnt get in the gate or doors.
good,"I'm glad I worked at Amazon for 1.5 years because I learned a ton, but ultimately, I didn't align with the work culture or values. In my experience, it didn't feel like Amazon cares about their employees; they're about the bottom line. Team work is not a leadership principle at Amazon, which cultivates a culture of competition and always trying to be the best. Be mindful of how much you give to Amazon because nobody is going to tell you to slow down."
good,"I go to work and we start off with excersices then we start our work for 12hrs, My only goal at work is to finish and keep a steady pace.They have paid time off. A very fast paced work environment. A very up beat and competitive work zone. They also have a very relaxed dress code that makes it easier to work."
good,"l'accueil est très agréable, le déroulement de la journée se fait au mieux et lorsque vous avez un problème quelqu'un est tout de suite la pour vous aider"
good,"Opportunités de développement "
good,"I dont know if there really was a typical way to advance.  Or else you had to slave in a blue collar position with the blue badge for more than i cared to, even with my engineering degree"
good,"A usual day on the warehouse consist of receiving and placing product on shelves. The managers have high demands for you, as you are expected to meet numbers. if you don't rank up on the top 75% you are terminated."
good,"everyday changes - work/life balance poor"
good,A great opportunity to learn what it takes to sort and move massive quantities of packages everyday. I learned the inner workings of a sort center (order already packed) and how to lead a team of associates at one of the inbound areas.
good,"Very competitive, fast pace.  Job is base on numbers.  You have to make the quota which means you have to work quickly.  I quess it is fun  for a eighteen or twenty year old."
good,"Some days can be intense, others not so much. If you can learn to work together with your co-workers it can be a fun job, but if you're there thinking you can slack off and get an easy check; you're gonna have a hard time. Work hard, play harder."
good,"I worked for Amazon (MKE1) which is located in kenosha for two years, I started working there when they first launched in 2015. When i first started my employment there the atmosphere was fun. I met a lot of cool and amazing people. Over the years it begin to go down hill because the original management team were transferred to new roles at various fulfillment, which resulted new managers. Some of these managers had little or no experience. I felt there was a lot of favoritism and cliques involved, as well as butt kissing too. Amazon is a great company don't get me wrong, but when it comes to career advancement employees must kiss there managers butt to get a head and the pay isn't all that great either for the work that is performed."
good,I learned how to do problem-solving witch is basically where I overshadow an employee of mine and they would come to me if they have a lost damaged or stolen item I would basically implement that into the system.
good,Long shifts with lots of walking. Periodic discussions with other employees and management about ensuring productivity and successful workflow. Very impersonal environment.
good,Scan boxes/packages for most of the shift. Management is decent. Best thing to do is to mind your own business because there will be a lot of lazy workers. You'll feel like you're working twice as hard. Pay raise hardly comes by.
good,"Not as bad as people want to make out."
good,Amazon Lab 126 is a very intense and dynamic workplace that is geared towards achieving given results in the shortest possible time.  Company is really pursuing new technologies and ideas to convert them into the new products and is willing to take a risk along the way.
good,"Amazon is a pretty lax environment. Managers are managers, co-workers are co-workers. It's an office setting, so it's pretty much what you would expect."
good,Loading trucks all night.Learning how to load trucks.Manangement was ok.Very busy workplace.Stacking small boxes.it was over in three months.Met a lot of good people there.
good,"Me gusto mucho ser de los primeros en ebtrar en la nave de martorelles , lo que no me gusto que como era util paratodo me usaban demasiado para todo y yo soy profesional de lo mio que es cargar y descargar camiones y ir con maquinas , por lo demas genial"
good,"Starting pay is $11.50 I believe they could pay a lot more especially with how much the company makes on the daily. The warehouse is extremely hot, the air conditioning is always out and the few fans they do have are in limited spots thats why employees are agitated."
good,beaucoup de marche mais il y a une  bonne ambiance
good,Very fast paced and exciting place to work. great benefits. and the people are great fun to work with.The peak season is the best time of year to work for the company.
good,"Although Amazon Fulfillment Centers have supervisors that really care about their employees well being. Corporate seems to have a complete disconnect on how harsh the conditions within the warehouse are, the amount of physical work that is needed and the Corporate Human Resource department takes days to correct issues which prevent you from working. "
good,"It was hard to work because of rate, but it was no stressful job. Also even though they have to work hard, they don't pay good and raising is so little. Benefits was great, but they should raise their salary more."
good,"People get fired all the time, and those who stay wish they would be fired. Management is pretty bad but they pay decent and the insurance is good. Just know you'll go though a pair of shoes a month."
good,It depends on which warehouse you are in on your pay and the rulse and job this one is for local delivery its like working in stock for a store like target or walmart
good,"I had a pretty decent experience working for Amazon. It was definitely a job that required a lot of multi-tasking and collaboration with others, but was something I was more than capable of doing. The position allowed me to make some money in a not so stressful job while being a full-time student, which is definitely a plus!"
good,"learned quick on my feet, had to keep eyes and ears open at all time to make sure you don't damage a package or get hurt. Had to make sure all packages where picked in a timely manner so all packages can get out on time."
good,Ambiente lavorativo piacevole ma livello di organizzazione non efficiente.
good,"You spend a lot of the 10 hour shift on your feet packing and picking orders, depending on your job function. You learn communication as you speak to individuals around you. Management was tough, they expected rates and numbers that if you did not reach on a weekly basis you would be issued warnings. I didn't have trouble reaching the rates but a lot of people did. There was a lot of bad blood between management and the employees as the employees felt expendable. The hardest part was the physical toll 10-12 hours took on the body. There was not enough work life balance as the overnight shift would sap your productivity the next morning. The most enjoyable part would definitely be the people, I created many lasting relationships with my coworkers."
good,"The hardest part of the job was being able to train or advance to a higher position. They offer the opportunity, but it's rarely given. Also, they are really positive about customer sanctification, but it means working really hard."
good,"One of Amazon's chief leadership principles is that employees should feel empowered to take ownership of the tasks that are assigned to them.  This allows the company to adapt quickly and encourages a culture of continuous improvement, or kaizen.  Amazon also uses a methodology of iterative improvements similar to the agile principles used by many software development companies."
good,"An interesting place to work, with a diverse body of employees.Great place to meet new people and make friends. Work VERY is repetitive,your doing the same things most of the day, some can find that boring. so you become a faster associate over time, although some might find it boring. Additionally, there's a lot of pressure to meet the quota, so it can be stressful at times,can be very physically demanding especially if you are out of shape. An overall good place if you have the opportunity to advance or to advance into other companies with a similar setting. Breaks are very short especially because your time walking (its a Large warehouse) to the break move is count as break time. Management, some are amazing But other some Not, this influences the rate of associate retention. Some managers even promote cliches and favoritism, while others don't."
good,It was fun while it lasted but could not see myself there for too long mostly due to management and HR. Breaks were not very longhand working conditions always made the job more complicated.
good,"Amazon’s benefits and pay are the best your going to find around for a company who literately hires everyone. I quit because I was forced to train on a PIT machine and even though I said I could do it, I ended up becoming terrified and was told there was no option but to keep doing it. Management can be rude to people on base level, and be prepared for lots of boring, manual labor and exhaustion. Night shift means no daylight. It would be a hard job to have if you needed to do more work or take care of children during the day."
good,Nice work place to work it includes a lot of walking counting n etc.  It also pays for schooling if you want to further your education Amazon sells millions of product the can name
good,"Put in a transfer because I was moving. and got the run around they told me they were going to contact my old site and tell them about the emergency move I moved four days before my next work day ended up being terminated because ""I did not show up for work"" so I could not re apply at the one closer to where I moved too. Only care about numbers then they do employees."
good,buen trabajo pero mucha presion en cuanto a rapidez y exigencia
good,Good place to work for extra cash. Be prepared to work. site location was close to home so  very convenient by my house. Managers do good job in handling all workers as best as possible.
good,"Amazon is a very fast paced, demanding place to work. The medical benefits are really good. Plus side is Health insurance is good as soon as you start."
good,The work schedule is set nothing changes except for overtime. I learned how to stow ( put items that were brought to me from the trucks ) away in bins. The hardest part of the job is the rate and how the communication just wasn't there. The most enjoyable part of my job was my fellow coworkers
good,They threaten you to work faster and meet higher and higher set goals and take our time from breaks or bathroom breaks. Stressful environment because of upper management. Managers are nice and understanding though. Breaks dwindled from 15 minutes to about 7 because they count the walking distance into the break. If you work fast and good they reward you with the most work so their numbers look better for upper management. They time your every move.
good,Love my work...fast-paced...but looking for job closer to home. Management made  mistakes on my hrs worked several times & work review. Most enjoyable was working on my own and getting the job done with over 100% record.
good,"The job overall is a good job, great benefits and insurance from day one. Some of the positions are a little more stressful than others.  In the summer it's super hot and hard to stay at a fast rate, which you have to or you get a strike, 3 your out! The management in certain departments isn't great at all. They don't know the job and how to manage it. Some have no experience and some come from a different department not knowing anything."
good,"Very stressful at times, Hard to find teamwork at times depending on department, Swapped between derpartments at the whim of mangement. Turn over rate is very high for a reason."
good,"Amazon is a very difficult place to work. Must be willing to work hard and long hours. The work can be strenuous on the body at first. As long as you have a strong work ethic and are good at following instructions, you should be ok"
good,I worked on various stations. I struggled with shipping out boxes with the dun-nage. However it was a over all good employment.I learned alot about Amazon and the company.
good,"The job is a lot of walking. They make sure to warn you about that. The pay and benefits are good. The thing is, it gets boring after a week or two. All you do is walk, pick, scan, walk more. It's repetitive. After a while you pretty much feel like a robot. Most of the people you meet are actually really nice. The job wouldn't be too bad for people who enjoy always being on the move and don't mind doing the same things every day."
good,"amazon is a fast paced, competitive workplace with long shifts and short breaks. amazon rewards you for hard work but the work is very taxing on the body."
good,"Ambiente gestito in modo preciso, ritmo di lavoro incalzato e incalzante, ripetitività delle mansioni fanno di questa multinazionale, una fabbrica in cui le migliaia di dipendenti si distinguono da un nickname su un badge personale."
good,there isn't much concern about morale in the lower levels. you are a number and you have a quota. The only concern is your productivity score. In the call center you are instructed to help the customer but not too much.
good,"The benefits may be enticing, but management is confusing and never listens, and HR is incompetent and almost completely unwilling to help workers. Most workers don't care, and aren't given any reason to."
good,"It is very fast- paced there all always things to do. They provide great customer service. You can’t really tell who your supervisor is, it’s kinda like you working for and by yourself."
good,"More emphasis on work and a tough place to balance personal life."
good,Good company to work for. 2 paid breaks and 1 unpaid lunch...giveaways...parties...pay is good....they reward hard work...............................
good,"They expect you to do a certain number or hire you for a position but don’t tell you they expect you to perform higher than the original number asked. Then say this is the position you’ve been hired for and don’t do any job you have not been trained to do,and will pull you from your assignment to load trucks when they just let half the crew VTO"
good,very fast pace place to work at. love the environemnet and the people. great place to learned new things and supply chain life. managers are very nice
good,"Loading/Unloading vans according to an organized route, while using time management in order to make the deliveries successful while maintaining customer service and following the rules of the road."
good,"This is a very fast pace environment, the best part of my job is my co-workers. The company provided great benefits.  "
good,"- Good culture although becoming bureaucratic"
good,"Long shifts with little to no time for bathroom breaks. Easy job once on site, long walks between bins with no time to get to them or counts go down. long hours."
good,The job requirements exceeds the rate per hour and the politics is completely biased. The benefits and discounts however are really good along with vacation and paid time off.
good,For a job that requires minimal qualifications and experience it pays very well. There is a lot of room for advancement within the company and it is all based on your work ethic and not who the boss likes the most. There are plenty of different and interesting departments and positions. If you have to work on a holiday they provide holiday meals for everyone working that day. They offer paid vacation and sick days as well as unpaid time off. Over all I thought it was a wonderful place to work. Had I not been laid off I would still be working there today. I doubt I would ever leave the company.
good,"I feel Amazon can and should pay employees more money for the work required, but schedules are flexible for college student and mothers with children."
good,"Good job with benefits, while working from home. Fast paced, however if they give you a schedule with hours you can't work like until midnight everynight, there is no one who will work with you to get it changed. Low pay."
good,"Amazon is ok to work for, for a short time, during peek season is the best that’s when you will make ur money, the rest of the year it’s just 40 hours at 13.00 or 13.50"
good,"a lot of walking"
good,"You have to pick and accomplish the amount of items that scanner give to you, without wasting time, speaking to your friends or going to the bathroom."
good,I liked working there it ws a busy fun place the satff and managers were all tiptop couldnt ve more organised they are willing to help and willing to teach
good,"Amazon wasn't too bad when it came to the workplace, the only stressful part of the work day was the company increasing the rate you are meant to pack boxes"
good,Not worth the pay. False promises made constantly. Relaxed atmosphere and positive culture. Very short lunch breaks. No PTO for holidays. High turnover.
good,I only wished we as Amazon warehouse workers got paid a little more for all the physically taxing work we do with a very limited to for breaks with 10 hours of work
good,"As I worked at Amazon, I felt motivated and like I was improving my life by working hard. Eventually I realized it was not for me but was a good job overall and would recommend it to a friend."
good,"I enjoyed Amazon because it cause the time to pass quickly and I wished I would have been able to work full time in the Customer Service Department."
good,"This company was very fun to work for because I really loved my work schedule and we got paid weekly but $15 per hour isn't very much in Los Angeles, CA especially with 4 kids and my rent was $1695 per month plus a car note."
good,"A typical day at Amazon is going to locker and storing your phone, keys, etc. You clock in, go to your station and work at your station for a few hours before your first 15 minute break which involves walking 5 minutes to the break area. You work another few hours, clock out for your lunch, clock back in and work another few hours before your last break. The hardest part of the job is how physical it is. It isn't easy, but the benefits are great even though the pay is sub-par for the amount of work you have to do."
good,"Esta normal, mal trabajo mala paga, buen ambiente."
good,Inventory product all day. The hardest part of this job standing ten hours a day. I have learned to troubleshoot better since I began working at Amazon.
good,"I worked most of my time in Amazon Fresh, on the supply chain.  The management was excellent and there was a great spirit of co-operation among the employees.  The pace was fast but reasonable."
good,"Journée typique : Arrivé 20 minute avant/ badger/ intervention management/ travail/ pause/travail/ fin journée."
good,"A typical day is 10-hours within a 4 day work week, you can expect to do the same thing you did the previous shift, however, this may change if you've learned multiple roles. Management shifts every six months thus you are unable to form lasting bonds/ have to tolerate that 'one' manager for too long. It's not as bad as the media or some outlets claim it is, but it is very fast paced in whichever role you are tasked in with a set unit per hour that is asked to be achieved. I enjoyed my time over all as I worked hard to obtain better positions and to train others. Hardest part is knowing you are just one little person in a big system and making a name for yourself. Most enjoyable is once you find your 'groove' and showing off that you're talented makes everything else you do easier/ managers and the like are much more forgiving of your mishaps."
good,"Will wait until I've had some more time working with Amazon Logistics to provide a fair assessment of their environment. Currently, still learning the ropes and took this as an intermediate opportunity until I've reach my desired destination."
good,fast paced always on your feet ready to work atmosphere but a little relaxed nobody over your shoulder micro managing you  or watching your every move as long as you get you work done and meet your quota you will be in good shape to be ready to work and walk alot .. but over all good cardio exercise .
good,"Be prepared to stand in ur feet the entire shift. Lunch breaks are too short.  By the time you get to the lunch room, breaks only 10-20 minutes . Supervisors sometimes are nasty"
good,"-It was good pay, "
good,"too much work, little direction, I was on a project with no solution. still did a lot of work, worked on weekends and holidays. no recognition. learned a lot made no mark."
good,"I worked there when Amazon was fairly new so the new culture of the company was not evident then. The pace was fast, shipping accuracy was paramount and bonus were paid for staying below the error ratio."
good,"It's not bad.  This department is probably the easiest one to work in at Amazon.  I worked in AFE for six months before I transferred to Vendor Returns.  I like this department because you don't do the exact same thing every single day, which gets OLD!  "
good,nice work community very fast paced just really stressful and strict. could have been better with discounts or with benefits people get and the breaks and lunches
good,"busy job but very repetitive, not engaging enough"
good,"Working in R&D was amazing. Once into Management it was more political. 70 plus hours a week and barely any family life. They work their salaried employees hard but the pay and compensation was great. Only problem I had was in BFI3 (Dupont) it was a buddy buddy system where if your not part of the loop you will be driven out. They also have many safety issues that get swept under the rug so it isnt as safe as a place to work as they state. I almost saw one of my employees get killed by working on an elevator and when OSHA was contacted the person reported was fired and nothing ever came from it. "
good,I meet a lot of good people working for Amazon. Very friendly environment and I don't mind the shifts and overtime I worked. Working with different ages and races made it a nice place to work
good,"Being a college student, it was good money but not somewhere I would make a career. Pay is alright and the benefits are great. Very strict, can get written up for the littlest things, but as long as you are in a good place with your manger and meet productivity or close to it, you will be fine. Breaks suck because you use 10 minutes of you break just from walking and then they expect you to be back for stand up. isn't sufficient amount of time when working so many hours in a day."
good,"The typical day at work is like building a Rubik's cube in a fast-paced environment. I say build because that is exactly what employees do with the boxes. Another way to look at it is like playing box Tetris. "
good,"Amazon isn't for everyone if you willing to understand the cycle it goes through then go for it if don't apply. However, at the end of the day, these experiences were worth it."
good,"Its a great place to work but I am just trying to get into something I love and cherish, I love working on cars I am a great peoples person I care about everybody"
good,-easy to arrive and put away your things in a secure locker room
good,"Nice place but very rude managers. I had 3 different managers for my shift, and 2 of them one female one male were very disrectful. I had to file a compliant and it only got worse from there so I had to quit."
good,"Catering was very fast paced, very hard work with little pay.  Management was poor and employees were not treated very nicely.  Food was amazing.  They worked around our schedules for work which was nice."
good,"At amazon I never knew what I would be doing until I got to work. I was either a picker, a wrapper, or an unloader. Either way it was a fast-paced position where you get to stay on your feet. The shifts are short due to the performance they desire, and if you aren't in shape you won't have fun. I however enjoyed my position due to the fact I am in shape, and I considered it my cardio. I worked hard, and kept busy. My shift was from 8pm to 12 or 1am depending on the workload from that day. The shifts went by quick and the time of day couldn't have been better. I was quickly recognized for my effort, and was given more responsibilities usually pertaining to taking care of the heavier boxes."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time at Amazon and had I not had to relocate, I would more than likely still be an employee there. The compensation and benefits were fitting for my lifestyle and better than other company I have worked for. Also, there was opportunity for growth within the company for all demographics."
good,"very physical and competitive. you drove your own vehicles. they did no provide vehicles. they provided lunch sometimes, your co-workers were nice. sometimes mgmt would tell corney jokes"
good,Come into work. Clock in on the time clock. Proceed to the standup area. where announcements are made. we also stretch our muscles. Then we proceed to our assigned stations. Log in on the computer and grab a box of the line. Scan the stickers then open the boxes. Scan and count the bar codes. and do what the computer tells you to do. Reseal the boxes or send it in a tote. Clean the area at the end of the day.
good,Great salary and benefits but management have to work very long hours and at least once normally twice per week in the evening. Saying that the team is very supportive. You just don't get to see your family as much as you would like
good,"In short terms, Amazon is a war zone. You learn so much and gain such strong work ethics/experience. However, you walk into a war zone that never ends. Constant workload with little to no consideration of employees work life. They do care about the hourly associates because there are laws around how long they can work but, salary employees get no treatment whatsoever. If you are looking to jump start your experience and learn alot, do work for Amazon. I would highly stray from this company if you already have experience."
good,The benefits and pay is fair but room for advancement is limited. Management team is freshly out of college most of the associates knows more about the job than the management team does so that leads to a little frustration if you have concerns.
good,Bonne ambiance mais tres fatiguant en tant que interimaire
good,"If you want to work on Amazon, you must have a nerve for spare. Overall it's not a bad place, but it has huge targets and some of them are not reachable without being a fighter in life. Company's CEO is the richest man in the world, he is doing that right for himself. You are getting paid good, as soon as you don't feel like you can make it - LEAVE. It's your choice for who you work, right? The job is hard but acceptable. I learned to pick in this work which I never did before, I learned a lot about inside business, which is not discussable. I loved environment overall, free tea, free coffee, fruits and veggies once a week, stretching every day with a team (in Germany), it's not like we were not taken care of, it just targets are too high. The hardest part is changing shifts (In Germany), it's hard to work 2 weeks late shift and 2 weeks morning shift, it definitely ruins your health."
good,I worked at Amazon for about 6 months.  Originally applied because of the pay and benefits.  Wanted day hours but ended up with overnight hours 6pm til 430 am.  Benefits and pay were good but there is a reason.  Very fast paced and managers are always on you to go faster if you cant keep up you get a 90 final write up and if you don't or cant pick up your pace they eventually let you go.
good,The work is good for someone who doesn't mind mindless and ever-present labor with little room for advancement. If all you want is a paying job and good benefits then it works. It's not personally fitting.
good,It was alright for starters at 1st but the longer you stay the more you noticed how some of the supervisors treated some of the workers and it was not very good.
good,"Long hours, unequal expectations, boys club, unclear standards for career progression. No uniform required which is nice but thats a small consolation due to the stressful work environment. Very poor management to associate ratio."
good,"A typical day at Amazon.com for me was clocking in, going to morning standup and stretches, and then receiving my job duties for the day. I learned how to ship single, multi, and VDF orders successfully and efficiently. I also learned how to train new employees how to perform all the duties I had learned with accuracy and proficiency. The management for my departments were for the most part very good. I had difficulties some days dealing with the placement of certain individuals in particular job duties but other than that, management was decent. It was great workplace culture if you are able to learn many people's names and remember what they all do and where. Hardest part of the job was usually pulling the long hours of the peak season when we would work for over 70 hours per week. I most enjoyed having a set list of items or tasks to perform and completing all of them before set times."
good,Great company...working nights is not where I want to be right now.  I would rather work days.  Amazon is a really fast paced environment.  blah blah blah
good,"Tolle Managering, die stehts den Überblick behalten hatte. Schönes Arbeitsklima auch wenn es zwischendurch durch die Weihnachtszeit stressig wurde."
good,Enjoyed working there for a part time job. could not afford to work there full time however due to low salary. It was good for a part time fill the gap job.
good,Its okay just long work hour and in the summer its very hot barely can work good and in the winter time its still very hot but the pay is great overal
good,"Here's a list of cons:"
good,"A typical day at Amazon was very fast pace and physical.  I learned a lot about Logistics through hands on.  Management  had a hard time staying on the same page from shift to shift but over all was okay.  Most of the employees follow the ""Work hard and Make History"" that Amazon lived by.  Very Customer focused.  The hardest part of the job was the long hours that were always 10 plus per day."
good,"Management is always changing everything (i.e. every policy, the rules, the people who govern us, etc). The hardest thing about that place is the Time Off Task (TOT) and how you have to explain your every actions. There is a lot of people that are not from America working there, just a fair warning. A typical day at Amazon starts with finding your position on the labor to find out where you will be working that day before lunch. Then there is the stretching and afterwards begins the work of processing. You get two 15 minute breaks and one thirty minute break for lunch."
good,Ambiente lavorativo stimolante. Lavoro in squadra.
good,"a nice place to work if you got the strength"
good,When I started at the Hub. We were trained very well. But sometimes we can not find merchandise in the bins. And then we have to tell a manager before we skip the item. For various reasons merchandise may not be in the bin. If it is not stowed correctly or the quantity is not marked in correctly it causes the inventory to be off. And we are on production. If your rates go down you can be subject to being terminated. When we are not using the scanner gun it is called idle time. Which is not always the employees fault. And it counts against the employee. The inventory is so off that it creates problems.
good,"Though it was a quick summer job before I went off to college, I learned good safety tips. On the other hand I wasn't enjoying my hours being cut so much."
good,They have some good benefits but the job is stressful and they tend to use their employees.  In total I really can't see myself giving them any sort of positive endorsement unless you really need a job.
good,"Long hours, very fast paced. At times unrealistic expectations that leads to stress.  Overall not a bad place to work based on compensation and benefits; however, you will reach a point to where you question whether the money is worth it.  Work/Life balance is a struggle from time to time."
good,The schedule I was able to choose allowed me to work 4 days a week. however they make you take breaks so you add another 1.5 hrs to your day. I would start at 7 and not finish until 630-7 depending on my last call for the evening. It wasn't a hard job just a little stressful when people would be upset about their packages and how they get lost.
good,"It was a fast paced job that required you to meet certain standards as far as production output is concerned. Management is easy to work with and pretty easy to get along with. The workplace is loud, so earplugs are provided. The hardest part is learning to keep up with product output."
good,"It is a very fast paced and repetitive job. Very boring after the busy season. Takes a minimum of 2 years to move up. Human Resources is very difficult to work with when you have issues that pertain to work-home balance. Great place to work during Christmas time because of all of the overtime and company prizes, but after the busy season it is very boring and repetitive."
good,It was a different atmosphere than what I have been accustomed to. It was a nice change for the little time I was there. I left to go into the medical field.
good,"If you're willing to put in endless hours, dedicate your life to this job, and have the area manager role take a serious physical toll on your body, then you may survive in this role.  Usually work 60 hours within 4 days on shift, frequently asked to do projects on my days off, my manager has contacted us at 2am before to insist we come in on a day we've previously booked off and had plans for.  Pay and benefits are good but other than that I can't say many positives. Although you're pretty much guaranteed promotions from Level 4 to 5 to 6 within 2-3 years of joining as a Level 4 Area Manager, by the time those promotions will come around you may not still be with the company - if you last a year you're a champ."
good,"Great pay, Managers are very young and straight out of college, some were willing to listen and learn from experienced associates, others like to say I'm the boss so do it my way, then come and scream ""fix-it"" when it blows up in their face."
good,You're allowed to pick your own schedule.  They give loads of PTO as soon as you start. They give 30 hours from the start and 20 hours every quarter. They also give you a paid 15-minute break. As far as the actual physical labor the job does require you to stand the entire shift and to be constantly moving which is common with any job.  The facility is usually kept clean and water is always available when needed. Management is great there. The only problem with the job is the lack of consistent hours and opportunities to advance. Some days you work 3 hours with no break and then others you work 5 with one break which is the max amount you can work in one shift.  This is a great job to have on the side.
good,"Sorting of packages and building of pallets,the hardest part of the job is not having enough associates for the work that needs to be done and only having a 30 min break in between shifts when you work a double.The best thing would be the people you get to work with on the line."
good,"The job is good.  It's a lot of hard work and it requires quite a bit of stamina.  During peak season it gets especially hectic, but the pay isn't too bad and the benefits are good.  The standards can seem to be a bit extreme at times."
good,"If you're looking for a job just out of high school or something to kill time and make extra money on the side this is a good place to work, the benefits start from day one but in order to move up you have to be there for a long time"
good,"I felt totally drained after every shift. It just wasn't  a good job match for me. The money was outstanding,  but standing on my feet for 10 hours a day was killing me."
good,"You have so many things to learn here however do not expect to have so much fun times as the company expects a lot from the employee, the benefits are good, management is pretty good with things. High chances of you turning into a workaholic"
good,The labor is really intense but its a good paying job for a start off for high school students. There aren't really room for moving up since management position is limited but as I mentioned its a good start off job.
good,"Assigned a work station for the day or they may switch you depending on needs. Coworkers are fun, managers aren't. Very poor communication across the board."
good,i did not like picking.. but the pay good.. the place i worked at was not good to me one side was very orginization .. i will go back if they do better
good,"Your going to want to get plenty of rest and pavk lunches before the next day or your going to visitng the canteen a whole lot. You will be walking on your feet for 10 hr , you will have 3 breaks so every 2 1/2  hour you will get a break. the first one 15 min the second is your lunch break that will be 30 min and your third and final break will be 15 min after that you will go home. NOTHING changes once your assigned your job thats it for awhile until youve been there for a year.Picking is the hardest part of working at amazon because you have to stay self-motivated and power through every hour do not watch the clock."
good,"Ho imparato molto mentre lavoravo lì, sono andato a lavorare e ho incontrato molte persone amichevoli provenienti da ogni parte del mondo e abbiamo lavorato sodo, faccio il mio lavoro con la grande passione perché ho sempre la visione di lavorare in un posto come questo e dare tutto il mio meglio, il mio unico turndown è stato il modo in cui danno contratti e le cose dipendono dal livello degli ordini che hanno, proprio come un lavoro stagionale, quindi, se non ci sono ordini alti, fermano molte persone. è stata un'esperienza meravigliosa lavorare lì"
good,"nice place to work envaliment i love to work place like that "
good,You go in and you put packages on vans. It is grunt work don't expect anything amazing. They hire a lot of people who can't get work elsewhere... meaning a lot of colorful personalities.
good,"You have to be okay with working alone a lot. There is a lot of quiet time, and it can be hard to stay motivated and focused. The work is tedious and mind-numbing because you are counting for your entire shift."
good,"Amazon pays very well and offers chances of advancement frequently, but at first you do not get any pay raises for said advancements. They will boot you out the door so fast for safety reasons. Basically if you work at Amazon you'll make good money but will always be worrying about your job security. So is it really worth the pay? Maybe not depending on your endurance and ability to watch your own back like an owl."
good,"Was REAL hard on your feet because all equipment provided was not being used.  This made it so you were walking 10 to 50 miles a day depending on your job.  Also when I was hired I was told Fulltime, but ended up being classified as less than fulltime."
good,I enjoyed working at Amazon but due to personal health issues I had to quit. While dealing with those problems and trying to figure out what was wrong I tried to see if management and HR could accommodate me so I could keep working  but no one was willing to. after enough stress and struggling I gave up fighting with them about it and quit. The insurance benefits are great though.
good,"i liked working in amazon as it was hard and enjoyable to work in different environment with different people. it was hard as i was in packing, so standing continuous 10 hours was bit difficult but seeing other people and getting courage made the work easier."
good,The job can be rewarding depending on your perception and how you react to various different concerns. There are numerous departments and they communicate blindly but very sportively to make things happen.
good,"Job is easy to obtain and easy to keep as long as you are willing to show up and work. There are not many rules, just as long as you show up and are safe."
good,Its a good job depending on where you’re coming from and what you’re looking for. Wouldn’t suggest this job long term to anyone unless you are able to move to a higher position which is hard to do.
good,All in all I will say Amazon is a great company to work for. My experience with my specific location was not the best. Very unprofessional. The clerks as well as higher ups and management.
good,"I loved working at prime but there was never any hours too many people working and not a lot of hours to go around. lack of hours, its fast place to work at,"
good,"Pros: paid well, fast paced environment helped me grow as a professional and efficient worker. Learned valuable skills from this job coming out of college."
good,"Amazon is job , at least, at warehouse associate level that you work at while searching for other careers or looking to pay for school or to further your education and opportunities with Amazon along with other companies."
good,"It's a good place to work , hours are not guaranteed , if he's were consistent I would have considered staying . Busy and fast paced, lots of heavy lifting"
good,You work hard and there are plenty of chances to advance. You need to be extremely fit and work at a constant fast pace. The chances to advanced are not fair for everyone that is the main weakness.
good,"Not a bad place to work, Not for everyone though. Management is very young and inexperienced, not bad people just not experienced. Most management can be found standing in same place entire shift just pointing and delegating. The program used doesn't seem to always be accurate or sensible. (E.X. As a picker my job is to use my scanner to find the product pick it out of assigned bin and bring it to packing dpt. however with well over 100 isles and probably over 100 bins in each isle there could be 10 of us picking and the program will have us all within 4 isles causing congestion while driving our PIT's.) like i said the programming could use work. Another issue is the training, they have people who just got hired training others instead of their most experienced employees. Undeserving employees get better positions and/or get to learn new roles. They do hear employees concerns, however do nothing to address them. Job is very lonely you drive your PIT for 3 three hour increments by yourself in silence just repetitively picking orders. sometimes gets to you after long nights. You are expected to follow a certain rate of units pick an hour however your picks are not optional so your scanner can tell one person to pick 50 units in one isle which can cause high rates but tell another picker to pick 2 items an isle and jump 2-5 isles each two causing lower pick rate which isn't the pickers fault and doesn't reflect on pickers abilities however pickers can be penalized for having a lower rate."
good,"I do customer returns scanning barcode so that the customers get their packages on time. Something the package will scanner wrong building then I have to inject it into the system to correct it and then rescan the packages so that it will get to the customers on time. The work is not hard at all but I need full tine work hours 40 hours a week, It cascual every day. It's nothing hard about the job to me. Enjoyable part of the job they give us part time benefits. Management is okay sometimes."
good,"The Management had favorites and had people working against each other and made the job unbearable , but if you were friends with the people you worked around it made it a little easier to deal with. I understand that the pace was set at fast and all but they could use a better way to moderate how beginners are to learn in order to advance and get better at their positions."
good,"This job is very easy, easy to get hired, and easy to keep as long as you're on time for your shifts, people make it hard for themselves by being lazy. Management is very unorganized and can be disrespectful at times, but for the most part this is a very easy-going job."
good,"A typical day was Collecting cardboard and cleaning. I didn't learn anything in particular.  The management was pretty good.   There wasn't any hard part about my job, and I didn't go to have fun, so nothing was enjoyable, it was work."
good,Benefits and pay and very good but the entry level position work level is stressful and repetitive. It's even more stressful when peak season comes along.
good,On a typical day you'd get to work and set up the bags into the shelves and put carts on the packaging line for same day deliveries. Great job but lack of benefits and career advancement opportunities.
good,It was a fast paced job very stressful depending on what or where you were working at in there depended on how fast you had to work I was in picking an stow picking is the worse part in my eyes stow was little easier.
good,The job itself is not hard.Dealing with management and so many threats is not needed.To mush repeated information on basic things that is common sense.
good,The hours are really long and the mandatory overtime is unpredictable.  The pay from all the overtime is good.  The work pace is really fast and the breaks feel short.
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Amazon when I did. The pay was sufficient for me, I was able to be 100% independent and I had my own apartment/car. The benefits were some of the best benefits I've had since I was covered with benefits from being a military brat."
good,"Good second job for someone with flexible hours and lots of energy."
good,"The team aspect is huge. You really get a feel for group effort. They give you a lot of options to train, but don't really have you do anything with it. It's very difficult to move up or get recognition. You get lots of benefits but you are very replaceable. There are hundreds of ways to get fired. It creates a very stressful and anxiety filled work environment."
good,"While it was an enjoyable workplace, as the coworkers and managers were fun to be around, the pace of work was difficult to maintain. In my position in pick I was expected to sort items at a high speed, with expected few bathroom or water breaks through the day. The pace became too much, but the pay was worth it, and the management can be understanding and helpful."
good,it is a very face paced environment with little room to make errors. Orders have to be correct and shipped. customer returns has to be face paced in order to get multiple orders done
good,Depending on your shift and position you attain you may have trouble keeping hours. This is great for supplemental money on the part time side. I am not sure how the full time looks or works as I was not selected for that. Being that I am homeless and without a car... just the 15 hours I get all goes towards my uber rides.
good,"The work itself wasn't difficult but very tedious, Shifts are listed as 4 hour shifts with a break halfway through with possibility of flexing up an hour but they flex up every shift."
good,"Amazon is a fun place to work with people from all over the world to get know. Lots of work, lots of boxes and pallets full if boxes to keep you busy and moving while interacting with many beautiful people."
good,"Management is a hit or miss. Most of them don't stick around long. There's a little room for advancement but not a whole lot. Once you hit the wall, you can't go much higher. The compensation is fair to the similar jobs around. The benefits are what keeps most people around."
good,"Work was straightforward but rapid paced. Learned various steps in order fulfillment. Long hours at some times, short days at other times. Very time oriented - don't be late from break!"
good,A typical day at Amazon consists of a lot of walking. Lots of lifting and bending and sometimes it can get very hit. Some of the managers were fair and some were not. I feel like we could have gotten paid more for the amount of work that we did.
good,I liked staying busy and collaborating with my teammates to meet and exceed the daily goals. 
good,there is always something to do. I have learned a lot of useful skills that i can use at other jobs. I learned how to be a great team player and how to solve problems in every situation.
good,"The chance of advancement is close to none. You only got anywhere between 3-5 hours a day. Unless it was during peak times, then you can pick up extra shifts. You only get a 15 minute break, and that includes walk time. So if you're at the back of the warehouse and the break room is in the front, you might as well just skip the break."
good,"Its an amazing work place and the way they follow their customer obsession culture is just out of words for me."
good,"I love the people that i worked with. They had me trianing up to 12 people at a time. I learned how to do everything there was to know about from the time we recieved the product. All the way through packing it out. I also took the time to learn my supervisor work so when he was out I took his place. My year was up, and everytime I put in to change my shift or to travel to help another building I got denied because managment said that they need me there. So I put in to advance to supervisor position and I got denied but they wanted me to run a supervisor area by myself without supervisor pay."
good,"A typical day at Amazon consists of a lot of walking, lifting heavy objects, and scanning. I learned how to properly lift a heavy box using my legs instead of my back. The management is vey strict because some people like to slack off at work. Hardest part of the job is the heavy lifting of big boxes. The best part is meeting new people."
good,I think amazon is a good job but they don't give you a lot of PTO. They give you about 3 hours every two weeks. They also give you about an hour of vacation time every two weeks and they you 20 hours of unpaid time off every two months. They don't care if you have a doctors note or anything like that if your sick you have to come in no matter what
good,"You can really create and implement"
good,Amazon Warehouse Was The Coolest Job To Work Because Of Its 401 k and other great benefits. The hours were ok it went well with the pay.There was never a lot of overtime because of the mass staff
good,"If you are looking for a career or a full time job, this is not the place to start. It is great as a side job or a temporary job, you have flexable hours and the managers are very cooperative. the people are not rude."
good,It was fun in the beginning but towards the end everything was the same everyday. I needed something more to keep me excited about coming into work everyday.
good,"I think this company will be around for many years. As long as they remember to care, treat their employees with respect and understanding.  Keep going forward."
good,"I had a love/hate relationship with Amazon. I feel that if I were younger (I'm in my 30s) and single, I would advance quicker. I recommend this job if you are okay relocating for advancement opportunities. The pay is okay but the benefits are unmatched. I literally stayed as long as I did just for the benefits package."
good,"Very fast paced, no manager over your shoulder so it is upon you to make sure you are doing the right thing or else you will fall behind terribly. A lot of exercise in a work day."
good,"+ Very smart colleagues"
good,amazon warehouse was a fun and nice environment put the lack of pay was horrible i have learned more about amazon and what they sold. the hardest part of the job was picking the most enjoyable part of the job was the employee
good,"I felt good for a while until the feedback comes rolling in. one person saying doing good then one person trying to see how you doing your job/show you how to do better, then one person say how your not doing good. Lastly your boss saying how you  are getting better then he say if you dont pick up you may not be able to change position/etc. having one not feel good about themself.  I thought I was going to lose my job."
good,Fast paced working environment.  Manual labour to which I was unaccustomed.  This was a new experience and was good while it lasted. Benefits were excellent. Work environment was dusty and ranged from hot to cold.
good,The pay is great the opportunity to lead and develop your own career is awesome. If you don't mind working 60-80 hours a week and irregular hours then this could be a great fit for you.
good,"Diverse place environment to work,  detail oriented company with managable Schedules. Multi position  advancement and opportunity Great staffing managers and trainers."
good,Long shifts with good benefits keeps you competitive and focused with one another. There are manyt different jobs to have within Amazon and after 90 days you are able to switch between jobs within the building.
good,"Amazon is a company that focuses on your rate for the night and if not met you could be let go because of that. Very stressful company, but loved the people I worked with."
good,"The pay at Amazon is  below average for similar type of work. The benefits are above average. "
good,Leider geht die Entwicklung immer mehr hin zu einem typischen Call-Center und die Einarbeitung der Mitarbeiter hat sich über die Jahre enorm verschlechtert.
good,"If you are not a people's person then this is the company for you. Just do your job and go home. You don't have to interact with anyone. Whole system is supported by IT to track your activities. Managers have very less say about your day to day activities. Overall, good culture but to rise you have to be a part of the group else you are left out like in any other company. This company has its own share of a** Hol**."
good,typical day at work was really boring. The place really doesn't teach you anything . they just want the rates that's all. Management was kept in line .
good,"If you enjoy favoritism and having managers tell the most hard working associates that they are being fired and the laziest associates keep on being lazy then you will enjoy working for amazon. All the managers only care about numbers and if you are even .01% below rate, you will be talked to. It is a decent place to work for at first but the realization that you don't matter sets in real quick. Would only recommend to people that I hate."
good,"This was a fun job, but very hard work. The bonuses were great and made the hard work worth it. I would like to do it again. I'm actually applying NOW. TRYING TO ANYWAY>>>>>>>>"
good,"Amazon is a fast paced warehouse environment which is both stressful and rewarding at the same time. It is a physically demanding job where you will be on your feet for the duration of the shift. I myself did several of the roles from receiving, stowing and picking of customer orders."
good,"Kind of like the cloud version of the Apollo Space Program, rapid growth in building up the cloud. As a data center tech your main function was break fix and hardware upgrades."
good,"lots of walking, very fast paced work and low tolerance for failing to meet targets, get tossed out when your no longer needed or when u reach 9 months,unless time scale has changed, but work is work. being fit is definetly preferable for picking,icqa, and a tolerance for standing still for long periods if packing etc, full training is good and amazon staff are pretty decent, the agency reps i only ever saw when  i didnt meet their daily targets which happened quite often, i always seemed to be about 10% off even when i worked my butt off in packing and picking."
good,"Arrivé sur le poste, briefing avec le chef d'équipe."
good,Good job with good pay. All the overtime you want so if looking for a job that you can make more money than the average paycheck this is the place. Vacation time and stocks as well
good,The people who work there are the reason you want to come to work everyday. The pa’s are pretty awesome and some of them are managers in disguise. You have to be on your toes about your performance because someone is always watching you. Management could be better. Working for recent college grads who still smell like formula gets tiring.
good,work days go by quick. learned alot. management could be better. good culture. the job itself is pretty easy. i like working in teams and amazon is full of team work
good,There’s always something to do so you’re never just walking around but the pay could be better. I like working here because everyone is always there to help
good,Good place to work my only problem was working nights and weekends.  Never got to see my family but was a good experience.   Pay was decent but could have been better.
good,"Bonne ambiance générale dans l'ensemble"
good,"internally amazon operates with no care really given to they're employees, example you can try your best to do exactly what they want in the ""rate"" system but they will not work with you if you just cant keep up."
good,"My job at amazon was to train the new associates, and perform inventory counts. I learned the importance of paying attention to detail and putting forth extra effort to get ahead. Management was very hands on and it provided a personal feeling inside a major corporation, I enjoyed the fact that it felt like a family. the hardest part about the job was standing on my feat for twelve hours a day but after a while you get used to it."
good,"Immediate management is typically good and personable. Hard work is noticed and opportunities for advancement are brought up often, though nothing came of it in this case. There are many incentives offered for motivated workers but they occasionally aren't fulfilled due to poor management. The hardest part of the job is the physical requirements."
good,"Walking through the plant with a scanner which tells you the specific items that are required for the order, and verifying that you have the correct items for each order. The scanner tells you the location of each and every item that you need but it did require alot of walking and making sure you hit the number rates per hour as the day when on."
good,"Amazon is great at first.  You know what to expect and you get pretty good training for whatever you do.  Most of the time.  At the site I worked at everything was great until they started hiring all their new, 20 something managers straight out of college.  Many of them were just awful!  Treat you like garbage and expect you to kiss their butts.  The experienced managers knew better than that.  Other than that there were the typical issues any job has;  your mix of personalities and the problems that sometimes causes.  Nothing too serious though.  But the company as a whole as gone down hill over the past few years in how associates are treated.  Associates are treated more and more like robots and less like people the way they use to be."
good,Prendre la marchandise que les receveurs nous mettent sur chariots et allé la stower dans des bins
good,"No need to have any experience. Just 18 and older and can understand English. Cool place to work, meet new people. Can work up to 30 hours during a normal week, and even more during the holiday."
good,Overall the job was ok. Ended up being a little more demanding than I anticipated. The job was also pretty boring. The benefits and pay were outstanding. I got frustrated having to work 50-55 hours every week. Would’ve preferred if I worked during day but I was third shift. I also got frustrated because most nights I had to switch work stations 3-4 times a night. And very often they’d be very far away from each other. My main manager got transferred and they kept having these other managers substitute. The management was very unorganized and confused
good,"Amazon is a high demanding and very rewarding work environment."
good,The department i am in we only count all day all the inventory that comes into the building. The hours are long and you are on your feel all the time. The walk from one side of the building to the other sometimes is a little different. And i also work nights and getting to go to days is not easy
good,"Amazon is a fast paced, high stressed work volume. At amazon"
good,"Amazon is an over-growing company. Unfortunately, you are just a number and not seen for your full potential. Because of the newness of the company, it is very ambiguous. The workload is heavy all of the time and communication is lacking.  I have had more time off options in companies that do not have as heavy of a workload. However, Amazon has great benefits. The management is friendly and inviting. The turnover at certain locations is extreme. From what I have seen, the company could utilize cross training in separate departments, which would lower the rate of turnover. Instead, the company expects you to learn your job and keep a 100% working rate within a month of hire or else you will be terminated."
good,"Place could be a fun place to work at times, but the managers are always watching your performance even if your a well known top performer. They like to always come up with ideas that they THINK is great but in the long run isn't. Other than the great people, pay, benefits, & schedules they have the place isn't the BEST in the world as far as a career. But it's a DECENT job."
good,"Manager played favorites, which is why I did not accept job offer after internship.  Team was always butting heads and were not respectful to each other, solely based on how manager ran the team.  Hourly/shift employees hated working there."
good,Great place to work for college students or for small families of 1-3 people because of school accommodations and different schedules to choose form. The only draw back is no consistent incentive pay or compensation for rated jobs.
good,"On your feet for ten hours a day but it's not difficult work. It is definitely not for the lazy but if you stay busy, it isn't bad. Almost everyone is very nice and friendly and the training is very thorough."
good,Great job for someone fresh out of college who is looking to jump start a face paced career in customer based company. The company is growing daily and will add more jobs and positions so you can't go wrong there.
good,"I was referred to Amazon by a friend that works there. I went through the hiring process and training in 2 weeks. I liked the work and the hours, but these jobs are for people that are fast learners and catches on quick with no mistakes in 30 days. I worked there two weeks and was written up for things that I was still learning. This is ridiculous that someone would be written up in 2 weeks while learning the process. I feel this company expect people to be perfect on 30 days and that is impossible. There were 3 people let go the day I was let go and the next day there was 4 people let go. I would not work for this company again."
good,"lots of meeting with ops and it team and training, then lots of projects can sneak up on you. with lots of users needing help. also, do not send a ticket to wrong place some team will complain to your manager without communicating the issues with you."
good,Safety was overall the number one important subject. Leadership and fast pace. Different positions to learn about and learning to provide costumers needs to the best of our abilities.
good,the environment is very friendly but the actual work gets very tiring as a full time worker (10 hour shift). you are not allowed to sit down at any time other than break time and can be terminated for doing so. Managers were pretty cool and knew everyone by first name basis. cool coworkers makes the job way better and there is so much diversity.
good,Great place to work for if you can handle a phone call center type of environment. They are spending a lot of money to make the space inside their buildings more efficient so you should get comfortable being in somebody else elbow space!
good,"This is a job that can give you a well rounded experience as well good benefits. Everyone will have a different opinion on the job itself as it really depends on the person as well as the department. If you are motivated and broke, work for Amazon. For the most part, I did enjoy being an Amazon Associate and I'm very sad I could not continue work for the warehouse."
good,I don't really have an opinion. I actually feel a bit put on the spot that I am even required to answer this question because I don't have much to say on the subject.
good,Your day at Amazon would start with all hands meeting. Views of how well the company and  individuals are doing.  You have to pace yourself with being able to meet their quota. I've enjoyed cross training and meeting with new people.
good,"The Managers were rude sometimes"
good,"Work can range from loading, unloading, stacking or wrapping pallets, moving pallets with fork lifts, repairing busted packages, or overseeing that the lines run smoothly."
good,"Expectations and Requirements are standard, but its a job where there is no room to grow, or really difficult to grow no matter how ard you try, low wages for the amount of work and money they make off of us, any warehouse position would pay more."
good,"amazon offers full time employees benefits but do not care about them at all, they only care about the management and not how your doing day to day. they are in it only for themswelves"
good,"The work is hard, but management seems to be approachable and respectful (for the most part)."
good,"Very fun people to work with.   The training is extensive and the best I have ever received.  My coworkers are extremely helpful and whenever I have a question, there is always an answer.  They have great benefits for their employees and even include benefits for their seasonal employees.  For the amount of abusive, irate customers we have to put up with, they should consider increasing the pay because it is not enough for anyone to sustain a living off of and put up with the constant abuse from the customers."
good,"amazon can be a stressful, but rewarding place to work for its what you make of it. I personally have learned a lot working for amazon, however over time I have become burnt out"
good,I had an opportunity to work on one of the high visibility project which gave me an opportunity to learn many different aspects of program management .
good,"intensive work and heavy load. short breaks, pushy managers and supervisors. culture oriented you can actually have fun while working with other co-workers working as a team."
good,"Productive work place and somewhat fun, however the HR team and PA's there are rude and somewhat unprofessional. It was fun to actually be in a warehouse and learn new things. Depending on your PA, they could make your job very hard or fun."
good,You get paid well and there long hours. But the management is bad. They do have part time and benefits are very good they got there own health paln. N
good,"This job was very stressful, extremely hot in summer cold in winter. The supervisors were always looking over your shoulder and would micro manage all"
good,It's a chance to get up this company is very good condition and I want to join this company and I hope I will do better the job is very important in this life and I choose this company because it's good
good,"If you work hard, attempt to make your daily rates which some people can not make in their departments then you are treated like ok.  If you speak your mind on things that are unfair then you are just about black listed.  some of the supervisors and management are great and fun to work with and will teach you what you need to be taught.    other managers have no idea what they are doing.  Benefits are great"
good,nobody lasts once you get about 15 an hour they find stupid reasons to fire you. the pay is good but the job is very phyiscally demanding and them managment dont know how to fix simples issues
good,They treat you like a team but thAts to make you feel good. Word load/rate to much. I wish it was another way to make he job a little more easier. If that
good,"Typical shift was answering customer calls to Amazon about a problem or question with something they ordered online. Calls would come back-to-back, with very little time between calls. Management was very supportive. Work from home. Set your own hours. Most enjoyable part of the job was when you were able to solve a customer's problem and they were happy."
good,"There is little creativity in the work and a strong focus on formatted documentation."
good,"A pretty good place to work, the pay is good but has long hours and repetitive work. Not a lot of chances to move up in the company but they are there."
good,"Its a decent place to work , and pretty easy to get on there, your feet will be hurting for a month walking across 24 football fields daily. Other than that, it starts off pay at $12.00 An hour depending on which amazon fulfillment center you work at."
good,It pays well and if you are not used to being on your feet for 9 hours on a consistant basis then this job is not for you. It is the same thing constantly all day. To me it was boring. I couldn't handle the same thing no excitement. 30 min lunch and two breaks but that's it. You are questioned about every minute unaccounted for so make sure you bring a small notebook and write down when you go to the bathroom etc. and for how long..
good,"* Tasks are monotonous "
good,"Yes, Its a great place to work, I didn't satisfied with my Job. I was applying for supervisor but they put me on regular guard. The hard part of the job was, there's no parking for the employees, we have to park on the street at night, but early in the morning we have to look for place to park our vehicle before our vehicle get tow away."
good,if you go to work looking to play and make friends it's not the place for you. You have to go and basically claim your spot within the company to advance because it's easy to get overlooked even with had work and great response from upper management.
good,"just bad management in general, but i basically just scanned  items and put them into their proper bins. "
good,"This is a review for the Amazon half of Integrity Temp Staffing. This gives you the opportunity to get into working for Amazon Fulfillment Centers which can be great if you have the energy and personality for the positions. After a couple of peak seasons of working for this position with them found it was a very competitive job to be able to not be weeded out quickly, and if you do make it to end of season most of the time Amazon only gives the Temp. service a limited amount of full time spots to be hired into Amazon and keeping your job."
good,"Great company and great job but is very demanding working in an FC.  Usually work four, 10 hour shifts (usually 11 hours for AMs).  Very fast paced and takes a great deal of attention, business acumen, intuitive skills, and crisp execution."
good,"With five day working in week which includes 2 days week-off "
good,"Being a gift packer was hard, but good paying work. Standing on my feet for over ten hours a day hurt at first, but I got slowly used to it. My only real complaint was that it was too far from my home to justify staying there full time."
good,"It is fast pace environment, with each employee focused on their assigned routes. To start the day we pick packages off of the belt and load them to their assigned routes. after that is done the floor manager will assign groups of employees to routes. you will be handed pieces of paper will a route number along side the pacakge number. You load up the racks with packages assigned to each route in order. You must load all racks before the drivers are ready for delivery."
good,Great pay Great hours just sucks if you can't speak spanish management is clueless but it's an easy job left because I got tired of being bored when you work 10 hours and can only speak to friends at break and lunch and theres 6 people speaking spanish and very loud it kinda sucks
good,"My goal was to convert to a blue badge associate. They had some pretty good benefits for them. Unfortunately, myself and other seasonal associates never got to chance to experience it. My safety and quality were excellent, but I was struggling at productivity. Management terminated pretty much all the new stowers(myself included) because pods have recently become very, very full. It seems they only care about numbers. I requested to move somewhere else to prevent getting fired, but they didn't want none of that. I was stuck and had no way to save myself..."
good,"If you like talking on the phone this jobs for you. I did not like dealing with irate customers and had trouble managing my emotions."
good,"While working 12 hours, you also get tracked by other workers through a scanner. If you take to long in the bathroom (which is generally around 4-5 minutes from you, you get wrote up. The workers are kind of unhygienic."
good,Long Work days during peak season. five 11 hour shifts of repetitive work and very little care for the workers. Most people in there are tired and feed up with management crew.
good,the job is good its a interesting place to work. And the people are good but the opportunities to advance are kind of limited.its physically  demanding.
good,.My typically days of work is every day different because of the volume what we do every day different volume. Reload trailer used pallet truck take palllets im work station .
good,"They do not do a good job of advancing their supervisors to the next level, and they only promote from the outside, which upset a lot of current supervisors. "
good,"They train you on PIT equipment"
good,"I liked the job at Amazon,but it was not easy, they ended up letting me go because I was not making the rate they had set for people. I went through a temp agency the the was never permeant."
good,"Learned a lot from working here from machine operating to packaging, good company to work for and enjoyed my time there. Met a load of new people and liked that."
good,"The corporate culture has strong preference for managers with a high degree of technical knowledge. Unfortunately, my experience was that there appeared to be a corresponding lack of emphasis on managers treating subordinates fairly. When engaged by employees who were dis-satisfied with how their managers treated them, the HR organization did not seem to have a means of investigating and resolving the unfair treatment in a way that the mistreated employees would feel was objective.  I loved the Amazon 14 Guiding Principles. Based upon my experiences, the company can add some principles supporting the Golden Rule so that manager-to-employee relationships feature honesty, fairness, and integrity."
good,It was a fast environment and heavy work. I realised a retail or customer service career was more suited for me. They try to offer a comfortable break and rest area that was a bonus.
good,Amazon takes care of their full-time and part-time employees.  But seasonal workers get no benefits and our warehouse has trouble keeping employees.  Seasonal workers can only advance to full-time and part-time twice a year.
good,I worked at Amazon for 2 years and I loved it when I first started but soon after I begin to dislike it. Then I begin to hate my job. No one wants to go to a job that they dislike. They want to atleast like their job and like what they're doing most of the time.
good,very fast pace work keeps you going all day but don't make any errors or you will get let go. hours and shifts are hard to plan for fun activity but you get holidays off
good,Its a great company but the Baltimore site is not run well. The managers are fresh out of college and are only at the facility for 3 months and then transferred out. The Human Resources team is unsympathetic to your issues and every issue is unresolved and has to be escalated to Seattle which takes forever.
good,"Its a good company to work for, if you're wanting benefits. At times the hours can become grueling because you will have weeks where you have to work 6 days. And at times you're notified the week before giving you limited time to find a babysitter, or whatever it is that consumes your life. You are given hours that you can use to take off time but they're limited and can run out if you're not careful. Other than that, if you're looking for a job that pays, and gives great benefits (and trust me some of these benefits are ridiculously beneficial), then you will enjoy it."
good,"Amazon is great for its benefits. The management is communicative but strict and the hours are long and tedious. You can only advance when management gets around to taking the time out to acknowledge your desire for advancement. Advancement is most of the times self initiated, not as often promoted. Other than that, the people themselves are diverse and nice to get to know. Amazon is an okay place to work with needed improvement."
good,"It's ok. The benefits are good, but you have very little time off, although it's very easy to take off. Mostly, I didn't like being on the phones all day."
good,Amazon is a place to challenge yourself. The system is setup to where they will have a hard time firing you. Meet the metrics and do not horse play and you got a job. The stock options are the best part of the job. Stock are at an all time high and might split here soon. Also the people make a pretty close second
good,"Days at work are long and hard. Learned how to work in a warehouse environment. Low level management is great, Higher up management is poor seems almost tyrannical. Workplace is a melting pot with language barriers. Hardest part of the job is attempting to stay productive and on task during long 12 hour shifts. Most enjoyable part of the job is payday sadly."
good,"The people are good and they serve free coffee. If you do your part well they will reward you. There are a few employees that are don't work and you have to pick up the slack; but, like I said if you work hard you will stick out in a good way and people will like you because you do a very good job."
good,If you are going to school it would be hard to start both at the same time . In order to change shifts to make it accomodate school you will have to be in good standing .
good,"At the Amazon Sort Center, the job was fast paced, but due to it only running on a part time, flex schedule, the hours were manageable. You could go to work expecting to work 4 hours, but only need 3, or you could end up with 5, depending on the flow of the packages coming in. If you do what you are supposed to, you can get rewards and such like building-based t-shirts and backpacks, and even a folding chair if you like that. The benefits, however, are nearly non-existent."
good,"Amazon can be very stressful at times, with the quick pace that is very consistent. High expectations are expected on a daily basis. But, the benefits are excellent!"
good,"The place was nice, the people were friendly but not career friendly. Like a revolving door but people are very friendly. Gt to meet some great friends."
good,Tough place to get promoted internally. Most of the Tier 3 do more work than the managers and get paid a much lower salary. Peak season is brutal - It is not worth the OT money
good,nothing to say... it's just a bad experience.... nothing to say. it's just a bad experience... u can find crooked people in from HR to Mangement... policies are good for the wellbeing of staff but the targets set is really bad .one thing I want to say. men are not a machine. fascism kill the confidence in people.
good,"good job, paid very good ..... but.. not for long time.. it is really stressful and hard, you have just to do your target.."
good,Work night shift. Should be aware of your rate in this business. Depending on what department you are in will determine how fast you can move in the business. Eyes are always watching
good,"Great people for the most part, hours and time on feet were a bit much especially if you tend to be weathered and have a few more miles on you than the typical college grad coming into this field.  Upward mobility is a possibility as long as you are competitive."
good,so many employees they overlap jobs and run out of work for them if not on it you could be sent home or they will send them to other builders to fill in where help is needed.
good,"working as fulfilment associate is verry boring, every day the same task and same story. all day long carring about targets and mistakes. not too many opportunities, just work like a robot"
good,"Your put in a department like ""stow"" and it's very very physical non stop.  They are all about productivity being 105%.  No credit for being on time.  If you can't make their numbers after so long you get the boot.  Not fair when you might do well in a different department.  I'm not there for this to be a joke, I'm taking this serious because I need the job and the benefits but it looks like I might not last there unfortunately."
good,"Productivity pressures are there, and generally the complete day is loaded with planned and unplanned works."
good,"packing,process guide, slam, kickout. feels like managers play favoritism. lots of heavy lifting and to much pressure put on one person at times when its really busy. managers wont help out and wont find someone to help even though you voice how busy the volume is to get caught up especially after lines go down or sorter goes down. I love all the other employees everyone of them were super friendly and down to earth since day one. we all try and help each other when possible because management wont."
good,"Amazon is great company in the world of business. However, their way to treat and evaluate employee is different. It encourage teammate to fight with each other..."
good,"I worked here two years ago through a staffing company, its a easy job, sometimes boring but good people and managment, would work here again if given the chance"
good,"Don't get me wrong. Amazon technically is a great company to work for. They will pay more than competitors in their area and offer some of the best benefits you can get with a job that requires little to no experience. If you can handle the 10 hour shifts (12 hour shifts during peak (Christmas season) at 60 hours a week), the massive turn-over rate because it seems like they are looking any reason to cut overall labor, and managers who really don't care and lie to you, Amazon may be the job for you. These are not just my feelings but the feelings of other employees in other warehouses too."
good,"not really a stable job placement that would be longterm. Not enough hours at times, which you are part ttime. I think this is for the first timers to do"
good,"The job  it self was very demanding , but even with that being said there was not much to look for in advancement, supervisor was very nasty and didn't really speak up for their employees."
good,"It's a very fast paced environment. Which is good but they have very high standards, and it's really hard for alot of people to meet them. The turn over rate is high. But if you can get and keep it, congratulations. They will take care you with amazing benefits."
good,"The typical work day can be anywhere from utter chaos to mind numbing boredom. LONG hours (10+). Consistency is not priority to higher ups, though the field managers are quite nice. HR is always helpful and usually quick in responses. Fellow employees are friendly, yet callous if it comes down to their rate to yours. The hardest part of the job for me was the hours, but you do get three days off."
good,"Can be a fun place, but many positions are tough.  The pay seems fair for some, but not competitive for others.  The benefits package is pretty good, and they do work with flexible schedules."
good,It is a long day but time goes by  fast cause you have great fellow employees to work with.I got to enter a training class to become a trainer so I would get to train others into do something I loved
good,To me their rates are some what unreachable. They want you to reach 110 every hour. However on one side of the building a majority people struggle to reach a rate of 60
good,"I left a position at a Company where I was offered a lead position and was under the impression that I was going to make a better wage. I unfortunately have found out that it takes 6 months to get a .25 cent raise. When I applied to this position I thought that there was going to be a great opportunity for advancement. I have now found that you are more like a number and it is hard to get recognized unless you are extremely fast. I wish I would have done a little bit more investigating before I took this position. I know that you are never supposed to talk bad about an employer but, I have many years of experience and feel that it was misleading when we first started as far as the wage goes."
good,I don't think that we are getting paid enough because we are using are own car and taking a chance with putting miles on the car. As well as the wear and tear of our vehicle.
good,Its a good place when you need to earn some money but its not so easy peasy to hit the target. You must work really hard. Agency buses are very expensive so its better when u live near the place.
good,"Normal day at work is normal, you do your job and its done"
good,"Management were good an encouraging. being warehouse work the job was as fun as much as the effort you put in."
good,I am in college and was told they would work with my schedule. After training they told me I had to work a minimum of 20 hours and was required to choose 5 days in a row with 4 hour shifts or 2 weekend days working 10 hours. I was forced to take the weekend shift because I have school during the week and can't work 5 days in a row. The pay is great but the job can be monotonous and it is not fun working 10 hours a day.
good,"Busy day in and day out. Phone rings off the hook 7 days a week. Highly stressful, but very rewarding to see operations flowing smoothly at the end of the day."
good,"When working with Amazon, you know you are always going to be busy doing something, no matter what. Get to lean how the packing and shipping industry works."
good,Amazon presents a unique workplace culture for their employees. There is opportunity to advance within the company but you have to work hard to move up. The most enjoyable part of this job are the people I work with daily.
good,"Worked here a few years on and off. As a warehouse associate work is very fast paced. I had no issues with it, but a lot of walking is required. Only downside was the required overtime which does get to be a bit too much if your not needing it."
good,"Good Temporary Place To Work....Keyword: ""Temporary""......"
good,"Lot of time on feet, very little break time. Hard work and required a lot of bending over. Very monotonous but worth it for the pay. You'll make some friends and learn to recognize a lot of familiar faces."
good,Great benefits long hours and boring work for me. Very little room for advancement with the many employees. Lots of exercise
good,"Amazon had good people to work with.  It is relaxed enough you can dress casually.  You have to deal with a lot of language though, being in a diverse environment.  When it comes to management, they are nice, but they are unfair when rewarding people for their job because each individual has a different situation.  Unreasonable expectations are put upon the workers and the same amount of productivity is required for everyone, regardless of their situation and the fact that it requires a team effort for success.  I wouldn't feel overly motivated to recommend Amazon as a great company to work for.  The pay is good, but you may have to accept feeling under appreciated a lot of the time."
good,Fast paced environment where you would have to remember the process to the letter to ensure that the customer has the best experience. Fun yet busy environment.
good,Overall the place teaches you a lot how to be safe to always stay alert of your surroundings and the surrounding of your co workers . It's almost like you're a family there for the most part because safety comes first at amzon and wouldn't you want your family or friends or even someone you just care about to be safe
good,"It is a good job... You manage your time, and you dont have any tipe of pressure! The only thing bad is the Miles that you have to do from your first delivery until you get home!"
good,in you work like picker in Amazonot its not easy becouse you must collect items of all deposit. which is very big. and is on 4 levels. Note 4 for organization
good,"While this company has a lot of great opportunities for younger generations, the work life balance is lacking for senior leadership. Additionally, the accountability for managers is extremely low - they are allowed to get away with way too much without any consequences. On a good note, the rate at which this company is growing leaves a lot of room for one to really leave their mark on the organization if they choose."
good,"Overall, the job was okay. Learning what to do was the easiest part. The job isn't hard at all. Management made the job difficult. Not only were they unorganized, but they had their favorites. HR was no help! Most of the time they were gone on lunch or roaming the building. "
good,"long hours, the management is not the best, but get the job done."
good,"Amazon was an okay job. The pay was great and overtime pay was worth it. However, the managers were new and had very little experience. The job is easy, but demanding as well. You can get spoken to for the littlest of things."
good,"Working at Amazon was honestly a great experience, but management could really use some improvement. The way they treated us reminded me of being back in high school. We are suppose to be getting a 15 minute break, but management allows us a 10 minute break. which includes a 2.5 minute walk back to the front and then back to were you working at, so that adds up to the 15 minutes. With my experience with management, they often treated the associates with no respect and it was almost like they thought we were stupid. They would often lie to us about how much volume we had to do that day, knowing that we could've left early instead of staying later."
good,was a cool job but it got boring fast. You were a robot for 10-12 hours a day which got old quick. Money was good since you work a lot. PTO and UPT were a plus.
good,"The company had a lot to offer to their employees. The environment wasn't all that easy to adapt to, due to different language barriers from the other employees"
good,"I worked through a temporary service, i really enjoyed my job. it was hard working 12 hour shifts.. But i was willing, cause i loved the company.. i wanted to learn more, and actually wanted to stay.. i was giving the wrong information from Human Resources. My car had broke down, and i had to call in, the lady i spoke to told me on the phone told me ,i had time i could take off.. She failed to tell i could not use my time during Black out..So i could not keep my job.. So they sent me an email, saying they were letting me go.. it put me in a hard spot.."
good,My work hours was the best. I did not certain attitudes worker had when coming into work. The pay was ok. Working wed to sat was pretty cool. Hours was pretty great.
good,"Great way to meet coworkers, very flexible and willing to make sure their employees are happy."
good,"Much is expected.  Well drawn standards.  "
good,"We meet as group, do a 5-minute stretch and check the board for our assignments for which area of the warehouse we will be working. The hardest part of the job is probably working in the freezer whether your stowing, receiving, or picking food. The most enjoyable part of the job is being in the warmer room of course, but playing music while working makes the job go by much more smoothly."
good,Très bonne ambiance qui donne vraiment plaisir a travailler
good,Worked theough multiple peak seasons. Never felt anyone actually paid attention to my actual prior experience or training. Benifits package while there was exceptional.
good,Breaks are too small for the packed break rooms but compensation is pretty good. Some rude people but pretty easy to ignore them and most of the time you work alone so it's great if you don't like socializing all that much
good,"Management was not so good here, There was a lot of favoritism and push overs going on. Workers were very much so welcoming at first."
good,my experience working at Amazon is a very tiring job because we work so hard but such a short lunch break since the break room is so far too. it takes me about 5 minutes to walk to the break room or if you are outbound then ill take 10 minutes to get to break room. But what i like about this job is that you meet so many people and have the chance to work with different ages and ethnicity. You become great friends.
good,I do like to work on C-return position but didn't like to stand very long hour with 10 Hour with 4 Days and my body is very exhausting and I get home and went bed didn't have time to spend time with my family.
good,"These warehouses are all about productivity, with a strong emphasis on safety. Coworkers vary, it is warehouse work, management is trained and very nice."
good,"-Fun work place and filled with ethusiastic."
good,"20 hrs a week. Guaranteed 18hrs of pay. Overtime available however hours can be cut due to volume."
good,"The job itself is simple enough, management and HR departments are a huge mess of miscommunication.  I was hired as a temp, and despite over 10 stellar performance and productivity reviews in less than two months, was denied transferring over because of one verbal warning weeks after the initial issue."
good,"It is overall not a bad job, it was easy to get. You go through a mass hiring event. The job is simple pretty easy to learn, but there should be more management involvement in choosing who gets promoted. They just go oh you look like you can do the job so here it is. In actuality the person has the intelligence of a light bulb but no one is actually holding these people accountable. Instead they are putting them in charge of other people who have way more sense and cant stand working below them."
good,"I was responsible for staffing of departments, specifically the TV returns division. It was my first time working inside a warehouse setting and working with primarily temporary employees. So I learned that you have to take different management styles with temporary versus permanent employees."
good,"There is a lot of favoritism when it comes to working inside "
good,Amazon offers great Benefits.It is although a very dirty and dis organized. A lot of the employees do not take pride in their jobs.
good,"There is no job security here and they only care about your productivity HR team is very biased and don't care they don't value their employees and treat them like scum. Needs much improvement building a employee to employer relationship. The work is easy they train you well to work on the PIT or any other equipment however the training for the other things and how the job runs is poor. Management is ""friendly "" with associates causing conflict of interest and needs more work"
good,I worked the night shift from 6 PM to 5 AM. The pay is great but that is the only benefit with working this job. This is a job more for older/retired folk or ones that do not have an outside life.
good,Coworkers were great. My boss always treated me with respect. We would work  60 hours or 20 hours. No balance in the work flow.
good,"Amazon is an amazing company in that they operate as a start-up company and allow you, as a member of management, to really own your work and its processes.  I really like being able to develop talent and processes.  "
good,"Long hours and few breaks. Very monotonous work. It is good for a part time job, but it is not something that I would recommend to anyone looking for a career."
good,"amazon was a laid back environment, the people were cool, it was just super hot in the building. Long shifts, And early mornings."
good,"If you can stand having 4 - 5 bosses over your shoulder all day, standing all night long and dealing with people that dont work hard. Go work there. The money is great and they have benefits if you stay on long enough."
good,I worked at the Amazon on Perry Rd in Plainfield I liked how fast I was able to move up and how much I was able to learn all I had to do is ask and they were willing to train. The management is very week and makes it hard for you to respect them they don't stand the ground and people run them over if don't want to do something all you have to do is cry long or loud enough. The management is not very secure in there position they are not sure if they want to be your boss or your friend. Some of them have know idea what they are doing and will as or make a statement about what you are doing and when you respond they fill insulted.
good,"You'll definitely be able to make a decent amount of money, but the work is exhausting and, from my experience, managements tends to treat associates more like cattle than people."
good,I didn't like it there but the money was great. They always on you about numbers . They also work you too much and disorganized .there were some good times and prizes also.
good,If you enjoy repetitive work then Amazon is for you. There isn't a lot of room to advance in the company I worked there for 3 months and applied to higher positions from day 1 and never got a interview.
good,"Is not ok with present target, pressure is to high. Much peoples from staff are not good in their possition. The managers are not comming to you for speak about what you dont make good."
good,"A typical day at Amazon Logistics as a driver is all relative to your personal attitude. Being apart of management was more laid back and less stressful than 10 hour driving days. What I learned while working there were my current managerial qualities and how to effectively communicate with a wide range of age groups. The management at the particular site was neutral on the primary level, awesome on the secondary & tertiary. The co-workers at the job were very diverse as far as ethnic backgrounds go; As far as a pure work ethic level, I would have to say that there was a rainbow of ambition when it came to co-workers there. The hardest part of the job would have to be picking up slack for the less goal driven drivers on a daily basis and missing lots of time away from my infant son, nightly. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be seeing the smiles and appreciation on the customers faces when they saw the packages that they ordered online in your hand."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of safety checks, start meetings about company numbers and progress. I've learned how to work in a fasted pace production environment, I learned data entry skills,shipping and receiving skills and also I learned how to be proactive in going above and beyond (safely) the call of duty. I like the management because of their experience to teach and provide incite. The hardest part of a job for me was being in an environment where I'm not able to grow. The most enjoyable part of a job would be the people that I worked with which made the time go by fast."
good,"It was a decent place to work for. Working there is good way to lose weight. The amount of work they expect you to do vs the amount of pay they give you isn't totally worth it. They give you a monthly bonus based on the whole builds productivity instead of your own personal productivity which is not right in my opinion. If you place 2 pieces of product into a wrong bin out of 5,000 plus you do a day they will give you a big lecture on how you are doing a bad job and need to do better or you will get a write up."
good,Good atmosphere but bad communication with different departments within the company. I enjoyed being around co workers and engaging in problem solving techniques to make work safer and more productive.
good,There is no messing around . Fast paced environment. the benefit are very good. Most managers are fair and are willing to work with you. Fun activities and give-away through out the year.
good,"Amazon is a good job have more departaments ."
good,Decent place to work. Not much room for advancement. Better pay would be nice too of course. Pay only goes up a quarter every six months and it starts out a little low to begin with.
good,"10h-Schichten, auch wochenends, sehr anspruchsvolle, physische Arbeit."
good,"Working for amazon is good. I work well with co-workers, management is okay at times. I learned a lot for working at amazon that I take to another job and work hard there as well."
good,Just sometimes hectic and unorganized a lot of not knowing what's going on more focused on getting product out vs quality of product no real system in place for advancement hours are hectic with no as much work during peak times
good,"you have to work under pressure, you have time limits, your progress have been checked and you must avoid errors. If you do errors 2 weeks in a row they just release you, no matter if you are at training. The hardest part at receiving dept is that you stand still 10 hours without moving at all (except breaks). Free drinks and free parking. Close to train station."
good,"It's a very easy job. Easy way to make extra money. Very hot environment, during the summer especially. Management can often get overwhelmed however they do try their best to get things done and usually succeed! Coworkers and Free cold water all shift long makes the job most enjoyable !"
good,When I first started it was a great place to work good pay and great benefits the only thing is now they want to make it like you don't have a life outside of work. Some of the superviser are jerk to the employees and change stuff up on them without telling them what they have change then start writting people up for it. So if you want to work for ok pay and great benefits then I would recommend Amazon other than that I wouldn't go to them or at less the one over in jeffersonville IN.
good,"Inconsistent management requirements on different days. Very inconsistent communication between management on shifts, and between in person and work assistant app."
good,"contrat en intérim"
good,"I'm just in it for the pay. Its decent. Fast paced, but definitely worth it if you like moving a lot at work. Heavy lifting at times sucks. Work usually fly's buy if your working to."
good,"The vibe of the work place is very busy, but fun at the same time. You have the opportunity to meet lots of other humans & build relationships. It isn't so strict, but the work does get done. No one wants to work with a pushy boss. Amazon is a different environment than most other jobs, this is why i loved being part of the staff."
good,"I loved the job once upon a time, but I learned some of the managers only care about their jobs not yours. There was one manager that looked out for everyone and made sure he did anything he could, so we would keep our jobs. Also, I dislike how I was forcely put into another department without my consent, when I was told at orientation that I had to sign up for any department. Overall it's a decent job with decent pay, and great benefits."
good,A typical day at Amazon is fast paced and productive. Freight is scanned in and received almost instantly.The motivation to succeed is clearly visible
good,"Easy work, long days. Got fired for stupid reasons, when others get away with the problem I had. They need to get more together sometimes they were changing overtime back and forth."
good,Good place to work if you need quick money and love your days off. Management doesn't really like to help you in your needs. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with rates and making sure you're hitting rate or else you will always be bothered by management saying your're not doing your job.
good,"A typical day was mixed as you did not know what you would be doing from one hour to the next."
good,I learn great customer service phone skills. I work from home so it was the perfect fit for me and my family. The job was just seasonal I wish it was a permeant job. I loved it.
good,I rather appreciate work in Amazon UK Services. It is a bit hard but helps me stay fit. I appreciate the multicultural dimenssion (over 54 nationalities working there).
good,A typical day at work is usually good. You get 15 minute breaks management is usually very respectful and helpful when given instruction. They show I high level of enthusiasm during the work day even though co-workers aren't usual receptive to it. The hardest part of the job is the hours and the commute. i hardly ever leave at the regular time at the end of the day and it takes a lot time to get to the job location using public transportation. Other than that the job can be pretty enjoyable once you get the hang of things and get to know people.
good,"A typical day at work will be either cutting open boxes all day or having to judge if returned products are sellable or not. "
good,"Fulfillment Center"
good,"Benefits were good."
good,Long days with good coworkers. Enjoying working along different people with backgrounds. Large building and takes a while to get anywhere through walking.
good,"Fun place,"
good,"The environment was unsafe.  The place is always hot, when break time came you had to walk almost a mile before you got to the break room then if you needed to warm up anything to eat the microwaves were not available so that sometimes took up your break time and your 30 minutes of Lunch time. Some of the co-worker did things that was not allowed and when going to management to inform them of such work habits nothing was done.  Too many injuries and when one did get injury you were sometimes released from the company."
good,"Pros -   Work with some incredibly smart people with cutting edge technology in state of the art buildings."
good,i enjoy making sure that the customers get good quality product. a typical day u work a ten hour shift. and u have to make a quota of three hundred items.
good,"Had a great experience learning what it took to make a fast moving center work properly. Gained a lot of experience very quickly in the use of Microsoft Office Suite, Inventory Control, WMS Support, Leadership and Kaizen"
good,"A typical day at work consists of production, rates and finding better ways to do your task in a timely manner. Some days you will find yourself being pushed more than others depending on the management and co-workers you are working beside that day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the company picnic."
good,"Amazon Fulfillment Center in Jeffersonville, IN."
good,Amazon is a very demanding employer and you will sacrifice your family time if you choose to seek employment with Amazon. Amazon does provide excellent compensation and benefits.
good,manager was horrible to me and everybody else in the plant.. Don't have a management skills at all... short breaks and lunches...
good,"If anything my time at Amazon has  been insightful and a great learning experience. A famous saying is ""Everyday is day 1"". The amount of skills I have acquired, the work ethic I have adopted and the connections I've made is truly overwhelmingly great. These learnings and leadership skills I will carry through in my next position. My co-workers are seen as fellow coaches where we learn from each other irrespective of the organization they work in."
good,This company would be so much better if they learned how to manage their people better. Goals would be made and exceeded and work days would be less stressful. Also this company doesn't allow cell phones in the building and there no way for family to get a hold of you.
good,"fast paced, always on your feet. good pay, great benefits. i learned a few things as i was crossed trained in packing,picking and stowe."
good,great job with good pay. fast pasted environment. excited to go to work everyday. all you do is stand in one spot all day and make boxes pretty easy job
good,It is a fun place to work at. especially the dress codes. They have good bonuses and allowances. The pay is good and the facilities provided are good too.
good,I feel like Amazon is the best online store in the world but I cant say the same about working there. I would much rather be a customer than an employee.
good,"i work here and 10 hours looks hard to do but is easy when u get 2 breaks and 1 lunch time but the bad thing about amazon is the leaderships are always in their office, they don't care that much about their employees, if u do a good job where you at u have to know that they will keep u in the same position unless u apply for another position and to apply for another position u have to wait 90 days working there to have that benefit. 10 hours of job is hard sometimes because every time i go to sleep, when i wake up, i just have like 2 hours gap to do whatever i want and then go to the work again."
good,A typlical day at work consists of two 15 minute breaks that are broken down to 10 minutes. The work in the warehouse is slave work.
good,"I would walk in, do my job and go home. First few weeks were very painful. You were more or less isolated and able to do your own thing. The co-workers were all great, everyone there was very hardworking."
good,"It is a very nice place to work, a place where you can meet a lot of people and make friends, perfect job if you want to learn many areas and what parcel delivery means. The hardest part of the job are the routes, getting payed per route, a route can have even 230 parcels. From this point, if you are not mentally strong, you start making mistakes, per example : delivering a parcel at the wrong costumer, not paying attention on your number of the parcels for a costumer, not paying attention to close your van, not paying attention on traffic,  many more. All this together equals stress."
good,die Arbeit hat mir sehr gefallen und die Arbeitskollegen waren sehr nett und zu vorkommend
good,good place to work everyone is very friendly and time goes by quite fast and the 4 day week is a big bonus so you get a 3 day weekend
good,Had a good time with the different cultures of employees they were willing to teach and help at any given time learning different skills
good,"dia de trabalho, dinâmico."
good,"If you would like a good workout, and can keep up with the twenty year olds, than this is the job for you. I stayed in fairly good shape while there, but my body took a beating."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work in my opinion, but most or some of the management and staff are not as fair with the employees. I also know that if you're looking to progress and move up in the job, this will not be the place for you. It is very hard to progress there. And commonly the work policy and rules are not fair or reasonable for their employees. Only people who work there or have worked there will understand the issues associated with this job."
good,"Is good job ,but i need something dynamic.Im not happy to this job because i m not payd for performance.Consider.management to medium level,can t change the shift,can t be flexibles with employers"
good,You get hired fast and great money and all. Doesn't help some managers are younger's and very disrespectful tours older people. Tours people that could be there parents or grandparents. I saw how  a younger guy in early twenties disrespected younger men just trying to make a living..Thats what I cant take. I know its a job but when a manager laughts and makes fun of workers especially older ones its not ok..
good,I have learned to manage my time during the routes that I've made . This job made me more responsible and confident . The most enjoyable part of the job was greeting with the customers .
good,"Targets, targets, targets, that is what important there, sometimes they even not fair with them. Good thing 4 days work 3 days off."
good,i worked there because they hired me and i did the job they asked me to do. They have good benefits.  It is a large place that requires alot of walking at a fast pace.
good,Easy considering the pay until you become good at your position and they begin asking for more and more under the same pay
good,"Amazon as we all know that one among the top E-commerce companies in the world, has been a great place to work for people to start their career with. "
good,"I would receive the freight in, and then make sure the freight was ready to be sent out. If something was wrong I had to retype it, or rebag it, if it needed it."
good,It is really hard work.. always moving and making sure production is getting done on time for customer to get there packages. They don't pay enough for the level of physical work needed in a understaffed building
good,"I'm use to working with companies that have the work that's needed in order for their employees to do there jobs successfully, especially when it rates these employees on productivity. Having employees argue over limited work because their in fear of losing there job is not a healthy environment that I want to continue to be around. I have worked in numerous departments showing my skills for the job and have excelled, but I have no desire to advance in this company because it's not allowing honest assessments."
good,"Work hard have fun make history"
good,"I worked night shift which meant i slept during the day and worked at night so no social life, high volumes of products needed shipped meant it was high demanding job"
good,"- dernier poste retour clients, s'occuper des retours et remboursement des clients."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of different job roles depending in which department I was needed. Whether I was packing( recieving the items and packing them to be send to the shipping bay), picking (locating the item and sending it of to packing via a conveyor belt), receiving ( scanning all the goods into the amazon system so it shows how much stock they have) or stow ( putting the item into storage read to get picked)."
good,"Working at America's number one on line retailer can be enjoyable. The creation of working relationships with many associates is satisfying and the ability to apply yourself is welcome. Most of the work is physically demanding with walking many miles during a shift, lifting, pushing and pulling. The pace is high. Also, your work is assessed and recorded and posted 3 times per shift. I have learned to measure my physical and mental endurance for busy days and to adjust to being switched to different positions and work areas when demand requires. For instance, I may be assigned to build pallets and may be asked by managers to divert parcels off the conveyor or mark parcels for destination. However, management keeps us apprised of the work for the day and makes us privy to any pertinent changes or requirements."
good,"Great place to work if you love to work in a manufacturing plant up to 12hrs. per shift. Everyone works together as a team, and I suggest you exercise and wear good shoes working here!"
good,Its an easy job to get and would recommend if you need a job right away. Didn't like the Four 10 hour day schedule. Felt a lot of pressure with the scanner always counting down the amount of time your supposed to pick an item. Coworkers are cool people but they are always coming and going. Did 10 months there and 90% of the people I had first worked with were gone.
good,"If you like to slack off at work and make others work harder while you relax then you'll love it here. Employees have practically no accountability for their actions whatsoever and after 3-4 months of operation they are still yet to assign permanent positions to the workers, it is very unorganized and changes daily. Here you're either a hard worker that gets over worked with no recognition or you slack off and walk around chatting and end up promoted."
good,"Typical day is busy busy busy."
good,Having to go through the security can be a hassle at times. I learned a lot of body mechanics and safety procedures. Management is always available. Don't have much time to speak with coworkers separate stations. Hardest part about this job is taking a break on a 15 minute break when the break room is almost 3-5 miles depending on where you are located in the building.
good,"It is not the best job ever i had to walk 10+ hours every single day and stow items on the shelf, although i liked the manager he was outgoing and understood his work ethics,"
good,"The hours were long, we had 10-12 hour days. The rates for production were high,but it was worth the challenge because benefits were great. The worst part about this company was that management rollover was continuous and frequent, which made consistency impossible."
good,"Amazon isn't for everyone, and the people who are built to work in that kind of environment, its not always fair to those kind of people."
good,"I will do this job only if life will obligate me."
good,"Présentation du badge, réunion des missions et chiffres à atteindre pour la journée, début du travail."
good,This job is not for the faint at heart. You must do everything you can to make your required numbers or you will be terminated.
good,A typical day at Amazon is a very fast-paced and busy day. I've walked 10-15 miles per shift pulling orders and stocking items everywhere in the Warehouse.
good,amazon was a fast pace job. the management was terrible . a lot of favoritism  took place on a daily basis. the benefits we good . the job was challenging and kept me busy throw-out the day
good,Fun work place with supportive management.  Very much about the numbers but also personal development.  A lot of red tape and politics (lots of actual tape as well).  There is a great wealth of knowledge and plenty of room to grow if you can get through the reviews.  Your value is decided by an algorithm as opposed to leadership.
good,"after morning stretches you are sent out to your department. as a picker you have from 7:05 to 7:20 to pick 20 items. Depending on which floor your scanner has started you on you need to bustle. If you miss these fast starts you will be talked. Your two 15 minute breaks are actually 10 minutes, the other 5 used as travel time from scan to scan. You need to keep picks to 115 items an hour, if you have trouble during the week and end up using your UPT this will lower  your weekly average and if you get lower than 115 items per hour you will get a written official warning. Trying so hard all week to keep up with the quota detours you from the job quickly. After work all I wanted to do was sleep. 10 hrs on my feet to do it all over again tomorrow, sleep was a necessity that interfered with my home and personal life."
good,"The hours are great. The pay is great. The benefits are great. Even the vacation time they give u is great, but the management isn't. Hr doesn't always get back to you and the uph rate isn't considerate of obstacles. The uph doesn't stop during your break times and doesn't consider low work volume."
good,This is a very fun and easy job. The hardest part is dealing with amazon supervisor. Packages is not sorted correctly due to improper training from other company.
good,"productive and also a fun place with lots of indoor games many on floor events."
good,This places allows you to obtain experience in a warehouse setting and provides a well climate controlled facility with great benefits. :)
good,"This company is great for benefits and such, but it is not a good fit if you have children. Every holiday will be worked, tons of mandatory over time during holidays to make it even harder to be with your family. But to be fair you are home when your kids get home from school."
good,"Working At Amazon Wasn't Bad the Pay and the Benefits were great but some of the managers and Ops Managers Changed the Job So Often that it was Hard to Keep Track of What We could Or couldn't do."
good,"i learned how the amazon warehouse and shipping works. the management was good, they made sure that we weren't getting bored with the job task by being joyful and outgoing. My co-workers were very diverse and i got a long with everyone. The hardest part about the job was working night shift and the most enjoyable part was the people i was working with."
good,"Work/life balance is what you make it - nobody will tell you to stop working, so it is all about time management."
good,"A typical work day USE to be fun, challenging and motivating. Now it's just a job that makes you wish you could find a better one. I learned alot in my first couple years from the leadership team but as the turnover of managers increased, the culture, principals and values decreased tremendously. The co workers were amazing, they just felt the same way as me. The hardest part of the job was driving from Cincinnati to Hebron, Kentucky. The most enjoyable part was knowing that know customers during Christmas wasn't going to miss their packages."
good,"Amazon overall is a good company, with great benefits. Low paying. On a daily basis I handle the work flow for about 24 to 48 pack associates, I am responsible for quarterly associate engagement. I have learned a lot about time management due to the fact that Amazon is an extremely fast paced environment. I do enjoy what I do. I like working with people and helping them preform to the best of their ability."
good,"Good place to work, has good benefits and full time work available. managers and associates are replaced quite regularly. Overtime is sometimes available."
good,Being a Sorter can be challenging when PA and ambassadors remove people off the line and  only leave one person by them self for hours. Not Joking. I feel like they really need to watch who they put in a management role before they lose a lot of good workers.  They push for Production but Preach on Safety.
good,"I have enjoying working here at Amazon because of the different types of jobs you get to do during the day. For example I may stow one part of the day, then I may be asked to teach new assosiates coming to work at Amazon.The hardest part of the job is the amount of walking you have to do each day, You can  walk 10 to 15 miles a day, then by the end of the week .The people I get to work with are great."
good,"Managers don't really know what their doing, honestly. Horrible leadership. That said, very flexible schedule, great work/life balance and your paid very fairly for the work you put in,"
good,"We come in have stand up for about 2 minutes work until 9:15 lunch 12:10 then last Break at 3 p.m. I pack the customer's orders, we get them out of the chute, make Boxes, send them down the assembly line to be shipped out."
good,There is many different jobs you can do. I am a picker. A picker is someone who walks up to 12 miles a day picking the items that customers buy.
good,Have a group meeting with the supervisors. They tell us what we have to get out for the night. Go over safety tips and stretch. Get on the Order Picker and check to make sure it was safe to drive. Pick items that is shown on our scanner.
good,"Things were unorganized"
good,A typical day at work start off with me dong my stretches and then going to my supervisor to see where they put me for that day. Its constant work so its a lot of working in a fast pace environment. I learned that I'm capable of multitasking and being able to keep up. Hardest part of my job was when there was absolutely nothing for me to do besides wait for more orders to be shipped out. The most enjoyable part of the job was being paid.
good,a typical day at work is very long. I have learned a lot from this job which can be very rewarding. the hardest part of the job is staying all day and during peak working 60/hrs a week. the management is okay mostly everyone in management is young. the most enjoyable part of the day is going home.
good,for the money amazon starts you out with it is not a bad job. they have a lot of shift options and if you get hired on they have good benefits
good,"I have been in different departments in the warehouse and for the most part, it is consistent work flow and labor. You will be standing on your feet for 10 hours at least 4 days out of the week. If there is overtime, you can work up to 11 hours on your feet and 5 days out of the week. They have good management for the most part and with the safety committee, there is always room for improvement. I would recommend this job to some one who likes to walk a lot or stand a lot."
good,"Os dias na Amazon começavam com um bom café da manhã entre os funcionários, após todos se encaminhavam para executar suas tarefas. Devido a natureza dos serviços dos Clientes (telefonia) o dia era bastante dinâmico, versava entre feedbacks por telefone e entrega de componentes (peças) dentro e fora da empresa. A gerência tinha uma excelente relação com os funcionários, pecava apenas pela falta de definição de responsabilidades entre os funcionários que detinham cargos de confiava; "
good,The first thing they do is give out info on all the things that happening within the company. Then we do a brief workout  and go to work. Our HR department is very efficient. The hardest part of the job is getting ready to walk all day. I have found several finds within this company
good,"The work is not hard but the constant standing and hustle on the hard floors take their tole on the body. The management is kept young, not much opportunity for over the age of 40 to move up to a management slot. They like to snatch managers fresh out of college with no real work experience. Amazon does have real good benefits and work bonuses, such as 401k, monthly bonuses, tuition for education and more. The thing with Amazon that you need to be ready for is when they are in their busy season, you will have no time to call your own. Their busy season can very depending on what department you get placed in and they will decide where you will be needed on an almost daily basis. The work is simple so they can replace anyone at any time. The pay is good for what you are doing because Amazon gains its revenue by sheer volume."
good,The most enjoyable part (and of course sometimes the hardest) about this job was helping customers with anything that they needed.
good,needs improvement  and leads need more experience wasnt tooken serious wasnt given options to grow. co workers were good very good culture but had poor leadership. hardest thing was learning rules when the changed hourly
good,"great insurance benefits and pay, but its hard to move up within the company.  warehouse jobs get boring after a while, you get tired of being in the same direct function or department. ten hour shifts, either walking, picking item, standing on one place packing or driving equipment. great company to work for, and great health benefits and pay. great job for younger adults fresh out of high school, great pay but the job gets old fast."
good,"j'ai travailler en tant que stoeur puis en pickeur, en stoe je ranger les marchandise dans les cassier et chaque article ranger dans un cassier devais être d'abort scanner ensuite ranger et en picking sur le scaner nous indiquer ou aller chercher l'article c'était quoi comme article l'endroit ou il se trouver le nombre de quantité et dans quel allée."
good,"Great coworkers. Fun to work with, but lack of communication from the managers and salary cap. Benefits are Great as well!"
good,Getting placed on a certain side of the warehouse and going through various locations counting items. the whole day you are just counting gets boring and a little tedious.
good,not as I was hoping for. process is broken. weak coordination between teams. too many dependencies
good,"The job itself is terribly boring, there are very few things that change the monotonous and long days. You work 10 hour shifts four days a week until peak, then its 10 hour days, 6 days a week. They don't really seem to appreciate their employees, but the pay is alright and you get bonuses and yearly raises."
good,"you dont have to work hard, you just have to show up....."
good,"Although I tried my hardest and went above and beyond for the company, they never tried to help me when I asked to be switched around to different positions. I enjoy doing tons of different jobs when I can, but it was never offered to me even when I went after it."
good,"Good company overall but it has its quirks, especially when it comes to following and enforcing its own policies. Promotions moving from hourly to salaried positions require 7 subjective interviews versus 3-4 for externals."
good,"Bon ambiance ! Travail physique"
good,Good experience for young adults just graduating from high school and looking for their first job. They teach you to be on time and a little discipline with job functions. Also to manage your own time you accrual each pay check. The importance of not wasting time or money to ensure customer satisfaction everyday.
good,"I found working for amazon exciting, fun and interesting. I worked in a team of 20 on a night shift and found it extremely enjoyable although working nights does take it toll on your social life. Overall though Amazon are an amazing company to work for"
good,"Social Place to meet new people. Great co-workers."
good,I enjoy helping people and helping the company be productive
good,"we start our day with morniing streching excercise & every department had there own excercise layout. Co-workers were "
good,Easy jobs all around but they focus on the small things rather then the bigger issues. You can get fired for the smallest things in that place. And it's very hard to move up in the company and when they do promote someone they don't do it within the department.
good,I have been working in the same building for four years doing basically the same job. I have ben moved around to run several departments but my main department has been outbound. At this time the schedules offered do not meet my requirements so I have to move on.
good,"A typical day is never guaranteed. You may come in to work one day, and there isn't enough work so they offer VTO (voluntary time off) or you're basically left with a position you don't want yet need the money so you have to stay. "
good,It was very slow process to get trained on other job duties throughout the warehouse. Sorting was the least exciting job duty in the warehouse.
good,"A typical day of work was a lot of walking."
good,You have your good days and you have your bad but it is a job not my career
good,"Fulfillment Associates pick customer orders on all levels of a multi-level mezzanine, pack and ship orders, and troubleshoot problems to resolution. They are expected to understand all aspects of production; and adhere to strict safety, quality, and production standards."
good,"not a comfortable work environment, could not talk to co-workers and would be written up for no reason."
good,"The job at Amazon was great, steady, and actually pretty fun. The work day could be busy or slow, you really never knew. The day was always full of surprises. The customers I spoke with on a daily basis were fairly reasonable and I enjoyed speaking with them. Although, I thought that the Hiring and Advancement at the workplace lacked good judgement."
good,"A typical day was to travel to multiple sites and review the progress of commissioning at each site. Some were sites I worked with external teams on, others were sites I myself commissioned. The role helped me expand on the project management skills I had learned previously from my other roles and employment elsewhere. I will decline comment on management. The co workers were very good and enthusiastic about our work and placed their best efforts in daily. I worked closely with many of them. Hardest part of the job seemed to be keeping up with the extremely fast growth pace while meeting the demands of the business with a severe lack of time to commission. Most enjoyable part of the job was solving problems and identifying better ways forward in newer designs (engineering)."
good,"schwere körperliche und stupide Tätigkeit"
good,bonne expérience malgré les horaires parfois difficiles ainsi que la fatigue s'installant
good,"a typical night at amizon was 7pm to 6:30 am "
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is how fast paste this job is.
good,Good working environment.    Get to work on great products and for a CEO that is a true visionary.
good,"Pros:"
good,Different expectations per individual despite level and job title.
good,"boa de trabalhar ."
good,"Positive coworkers, helpful supervisors, hands-off administration, comfortable work environment"
good,Amazon.com hires mostly through temp agencies. Depending on your rating after so many months or after peak seasons you are either kept on and employed by Amazon.com or laid off after peak seasons.
good,Perception weighs a lot more than performance. If you can nod your head in any situation and agree with the abundant number of managers you will go straight to the top but beware of having an opinion that doesnt agree with management then you are not a team player. Clean environment good pay unbelievable time off. Dont look for support from your manager his/her role is only to agree to whatever operation says. In two years I never heard my supervisor say anything technical electrical mechanical or suggest a remedy to an issue.
good,"picking, packing operating  Box on Demand (BOD) machine. Operating Low level order pickers  and offering training to new hires. "
good,"Great place to work for if you get blue badge, people that you work with are great. very friendly"
good,Great place to get experience to take somewhere else. They do have favorites like any other place. It's a high school environment so gossip will occur often.
good,Hard days work of walking and keeping up your rate but a great work environment great people to work with
good,amazon is a okay company to work for if people was more respectful towards each other it would be great.
good,typical day was geting correct papper work and collect all orders and hit a tarrget learned how the warehouse industry works and how to find stalk fast useing barcode scanners
good,"There is a sense of family to the Amazon team, but if you're there for any length of time you realize that ""who you know"" is a huge factor at their call center in Kennewick, Washington. I was there for a few months longer than six years and watched qualified people get passed over for promotions several times while someone say, who went to a particular church, filled a particular  position."
good,"good co-workers, how not to manage a company, mass confusion"
good,I like working for Amazon however management blatantly plays favorites! It's hard to move on to different functions if you don't know a manager or PA. They constantly tell you what you want to hear when you complain just so you'll leave them alone.
good,"First day of my job was very difficult to me because every thing is new for me"
good,Very fast paced and busy. Lots of exercise and great people to work with. I was able to learn the complete warehouse which  gave me a better understanding of the business. The hardest part of the job is moving from function to function while trying to maintain rate expectations. The greatest part of the job is it's like shopping 10 hrs a day without paying the bill.  Most of the management team is great but they are all fairly new and do not realize what it really takes to do this job.
good,"A typical day there dependent on which section you are on is hard work especially picking no so much about the physical labour but if you cant stand being on your feet and constantly walking around for hours this is not a job for you. Packing however, if you like routine and repetitive work then this is for you. However, be sure to wear some form of gloves or apply cream every night as can cause your hands to go extremely dry. Whilst there i also did gift wrap, this was by far my favorite job there although fast paced is an intricate and enjoyable job at work but when it comes to wrapping your own presents at Christmas you just do not want to. Management are strict but fair and are extremely understanding if you have problems and are eager to help you learn."
good,"I was a single mother at the time, with a six month old baby. Her child care facility called me at work and informed me that my six month old was running a fever of 104 degrees Fahrenheit. I immediately took her to the Dr., to find out she had RSV. On my return to work I was called in to HR and was told they would not stand for me taking off and threatened my employment with them. Mind you I went straight to the Dr. and had a Dr.'s note. Just do not think that they should have threatened my job. That is all. Thank you for reading this."
good,"Amazon expected more than one person could do because of workers ""cherry picking"" through the product to be put up. When I say ""cherry picking"" I mean that people would go through and get smaller items so that there numbers would go up instead of making the boxes even. I thought management was good just could have been better. I was part of the quality team which I enjoyed a lot. It was my favorite part of working at Amazon."
good,"Typical work"
good,company is not so concerned about employees they worry more about products than employee safety.
good,"Too much walking, too many temps not enough full time.  boring after the peak season"
good,"ich habe dort im outbound packete verpackt und verschickt"
good,"good benefits but not a place to make a career out of, unorganized, long hours but a guaranteed 40 to 50 hours a week "
good,This is a fast paced high production workplace.  I learned how to manage and organized the work flow to consistently exceed production rates.  The management praise good performance.  I stayed in excellent shape while working there.
good,"Amazon is a great place to work. The company grows more and more every single day. That being said, the warehouse I worked at specifically, I felt, just cared about the numbers and not really the people that helped them reach their goals. I understand that rate is important, but I felt that even if you were making rate that wasn't good enough. The management was always helpful when it came to questions I had about certain picks or products. A typical day at work consisted of picking customers orders by using a stand up forklift, or cherry picker. Sometimes, I would be sorting packages and loading trucks on the shipping dock, and other times I would be on the ground in the shelving units picking smaller orders. The hardest part was trying to make rate, which sometimes felt impossible, so you didn't get written up for ""off task"" time. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting goals that were thought to be unattainable and making customers happy by giving them what they ordered sooner than they expected."
good,Working in a warehouse is a challenging place however with the drive and commitment goals can be exceeded. Amazon was great place to work however the work that i had undertaken i felt that i was under the gun as each day the i had to work harder in order to raise my working percentage which did become frustrating at times.
good,I have taken up many escalations and have succeeded in attaining goals. 
good,"working by having fun"
good,"hi,"
good,"amazon is a great place to work. it has it pros and cons like any other job has ,but with amazon theres more pros than cons."
good,At the start of the shift i would go collect my Inbound/Picker scan gun (use scan gun too scan every order i am to pick for orders). Then i would go to the start up meeting where management would tell us of anything we need to know before we start our shift i.e what the day's target is and ask safety questions with the staff.
good,It's been a steep learning curve for me over at Amazon since I had minimal industry exposure as a college grad.
good,It's not a bad company to work for. I feel like the management team plays favorites a little bit and that in my opinion makes it hard to move up in the company. I did learn a lot about warehouse environments and how they work in my time here.
good,Amazon is a very customer centric company. A typical day at work can be stressfull. Management has so many different ways of getting the same job done. The overall moral of my co-workers have considerably went down since we first started in october. The hardest part of my job is adapting to the fact that they are very disorganized.
good,"A typical day of work, is simple, scan one thing to another, I haven't learned much at all, management I can't say to much about. It is however a somewhat fun environment when it comes to co-workers, everyone is very friendly and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with rate, you have to have a 100% a 100% of the time and it isn't exactly easy, the most enjoyable part is the friendships I have built"
good,A typical day working at Amazon would be described as monotonous unless trained under other departments. As a picker the job is straight forward pick orders in a timely fashion for shipment. A picker is required to meet a percentage of 100 each week to meet expectations.
good,"was a ok place to work, doesnt do much hiring on good breaks, clean place, normal days work"
good,Typical work day is full of different jobs and duties throughout the day i have learned how to use excel more efficiently . The management are not together they work place is very unorganized
good,i learn how to pick and pack and stow preap record and resive the item
good,"the plant is very proffessional and the training is excellent saftey is a top prioritie and you are provided all the saftey equipment ,staff on hand is available for any concerns you have and it really is a good introduction to the fast paced world of outbound pakage express buisness.the hours are late night and it is a physical taxing , they have a good startup program of stretching and a daily update of the routine s and safty concerns ,the employees are all very helpful and the management is always ready to answer any questions,it a self starters day of filling the gaps and find a spot but the pace is very quick and you have to learn fast,"
good,"You will be working very hard at amazon or you will be fired, plain and simple. Its an easy job to do, but its boring and monotonous. Co-workers are great and I've made quite a few friends through Amazon. The management is hectic and there seem to be too many managers with not enough communication between them. They have a inside hiring process for most jobs, but its very flawed. The hardest part is easily most of the jobs are so repetitive that you just feel like a machine, you are not challenged at all. The best part is that I've lost quite a lot of weight working so hard though."
good,it includied alot of standing in the one place for 8 hours and it wasnt to pleasant.. id rather be moving around.
good,Typical day at work would start off with a quick 5 minute briefing on how the shift was life before and what it would be like after shift. I learnt many different tasks as I was multi trained. The management was a bit off as they were all over the place. My co-workers were easy to get on with. Sometimes the hardest part of the job was trying to reach targets. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to work with friends.
good,> Ensuring Best Deals for the customer.
good,"At Amazon, work wasn't difficult, but management made things confusing. Long Days and short breaks with a lot of standing. Great co-workers, a lot of team work. Management a lot of times didnt know what they were doing. Hardest part is standing for a long period of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and becoming a family."
good,Amazon provides great benefits and a challenging environment. Work life balance is on a lower side
good,"Stand on feet all day, do repetitive robotic tasks 10 hours a day with little breaks."
good,"worked long hours, alot of overtime, had to finish the job, in somewhat of time."
good,"Great group of people to work with and lots of areas to challenge yourself in! The offices are nice, maybe a bit crowded, but Amazon is working on opening more real estate every day. If you want to have fun at work, Amazon is for you!"
good,Prácticamente todos los días en el trabajo son idénticos.
good,I worked with the RF Scanner pushing carts to raise up rate to 100%.
good,"I learned a lot of new processes, I had excellent team around me, everyone was helpful and great team spirit, however we don't had any fun because of high targets/maps."
good,"is a fairly descent company to work for, the company has some pretty good benefits"
good,When working at amazon you don't have to worry about looking at a schedule every week and expect tons of overtime. When working at amazon you will soon realize that it's a great company to be involved with but the downside is that it the starting wage inst enough for the work that you do.
good,"The work is rough but it is really worth it, you will sweat but the pay off at the end of the week is great. What you typically do is come in and clock in do some stretching then get right to work the job is fast-paced but it the people are great I would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to work in a warehouse."
good,"This job is easy/hard. The work itself is easy on the brain to the point of boredom.  It is physically demanding. You stand on your feet 10 hours, you are pulling and pushing merchandise and equipment all day."
good,"Excellent leadership training program and educational opportunities. Good benefits. Horrible rate expectation culture. Injuries are a given and because of the workers compensation laws in the particular state I worked in, Amazon was exempt from any liability. Despite being injured on the job, permanently as a 35 year old and being unable to perform average job functions moving forward, I was not legally able to receive any  were respond for. compensation from Amazon for what there work practices"
good,Good part time work but I wouldn't be able to do it full time. Great staff. Hard to grow here. They make a good effort at being organized but it can still be a little chaotic.
good,"Depending on your role the job can be fun. Management changes a lot, you can have 5 different managers in 1 year. It's always changing."
good,"Working directly for Amazon was really fun, unfortunately it was only seasonal I was glad to get hired on directly from Amazon, and not a third party logistics company."
good,"It gets really challenging from time to time but nevertheless, it's a good place to start. If you enjoy consistency and fast-pasted work involving moving heavy boxes then this might be the job for you."
good,A picker spends his day walking between 12 and 15 miles.  Each day is different based on the location of the required items picked.  I enjoyed working a 4 day work week.
good,"Job is demanding depending on the type of work your doing.  Other employees are nice and help each other out. Some work hard, some slide by.  Team leaders tend to take advantage of their position when it comes to breaks and not helping Associates."
good,"HR was rude and unprofessional more than not! The building switched Managers every three months, the managers were younger than most of the employees and had no people skills, they did not know how to properly communicate things with their team. Job security is not their at all, in fact it was so unprofessional that jobs were lost on pure u professionalism and things that had nothing to do with the job."
good,"The pay was good and the onboarding process was the best and easiest. I am for productivity, that said, Amazon should review their excessive focus on productivity at the expense of other job satisfaction measures. Their productivity tracking tools need some tweaking. Their appraisal process of employee productivity could also use some tweaking."
good,Amazon is of course a good company to work for but they will move you to different departments every so often about every 6 months and this is done without asking if you are interested. Beginning in logistics I loved it esp. working with Geomaps but surprise you are going to retail which was the main area that I did not want to go to. Best thing was that you can get a schedule close to if not exactly what you want.
good,i had  got the chance to experience delivery on the other side of amazon and fun work enviroment but its verry demanding and also there are long shifts
good,"Good thing about Amazon is that you can get exposure to a big system and everything you build is at large scale. "
good,I learned that a job like that u need to be able to move fast and be accurate. I liked working with some of the people but some was just really rude. I don't think they give enough time for breaks when u have to walk for 5 mins just to get outside.
good,Job was good for advancements but not pay raises. They acknowledge workers for good attendance and work ethic but no promotions or pay raises unless by time there. Positions don't really allow many workers to shine and get a different level just different name with more responsibilities and same pay.
good,"Management was good "
good,cool et détendue bonne ambiance entre collègues et la direction
good,It's an okay job. It pays the bills. My manager was fair and honest. I was a decent job and the pay was modest. Working there was an alright experience. Peak time was extremely busy. But it was okay overall.
good,They need you to be a robot nothing more nothing less and you will be successful. The lucky few move up who build friendships with current managers has nothing to do with experience or education if you start out as a warehouse hand.
good,"I entered the stow department. We were expected to stow 250 items every hour, an item every 9 seconds. If you were “off task” for more than 30 minutes in a day you were wrote up, which meant if you wanted to transfer you can’t for another 30 days. It a lot that they don’t tell you when you’re hired. ASK QUESTIONS. Avoid stow and picking if possible."
good,It’s a great work environment. The managers care about your health and safety. They take Initiative to help workers any way they can. They make you feel comfortable in an uncomfortable environment.
good,I love working for this company and I'm very good and I excel at this been with them for almost two years however in December I got really sick and their policies for sickness as well as their team causing me to lose my documentation causing my job on the line
good,"I've been temping with Amazon for over four months now. Like all jobs it has it's ups and downs but overall it's not great. The job itself is fairly straightforward and the pay is great for what it is, but you will work long hours with little time for breaks. This is somewhat balanced out by having three days off a week. The nature of the work is very repetitive and as a picker it can be  very isolating as you won't get to interact with your colleagues much. Music is played throughout the warehouse to take some of the boredom away, but is switched off a lot of the time as well. There are occasionally small freebies involved and they often put on different events for the staff, especially in the run up to Christmas. However even with all that you do feel like another cog in the machine. In short it's not the worst place to work but it's not the best either. I'd recommend doing it if you want some extra money for Christmas but it's not somewhere I would want to stay."
good,"The managers and process assistants (PA) there had their picks on who they liked and who they didn't. If they didn't like you, you'd know for sure! The job wasn't hard though. It was the easiest plant job, as far as manual work, that I've ever had."
good,Amazon is a great place to work if you do not have a family at home. The scheduling and mandatory extra shifts are not very conducive to a lifestyle with children.
good,I did my best as an employee to keep my scan rate up and moving to the work. If an individual is able to handle fast pace environment and keeping scan rate up and lifting boxes then go for it!
good,I worked as senior associate in compliance variable department in Amazon. Total i have 5 years experience in e commerce industry. I have indepth knowledge of e - commerce industry
good,"I liked working on the dock loading trucks and whatnot but picking was boring and managment is up your butt if you dont keep up with their 100% rate. Theres good and there is bad. as with any job, really."
good,"Amazon offers an amazing base pay, but the hours working and time off flexibility is terrible. I worked 12 hour night shifts about 3-5 days a week, and lost a lot of sleep. But I did earn a lot of money and moved quickly through management.  There are plenty of opportunities at amazon, but I would not recommend this job to anyone who has little work ethic or cannot lift/stand continuously for at most 12 hours."
good,If you like occasionally being micromanaged then left completely to flounder on your own well...  two breaks a day... make sure you ask a million and one questions... absolutely no phones allowed
good,"The work you put in is exactly reflected on your paycheck. It got lonely, you do not work with people as much as you work with machines. It is not hard work, but it is boring. Anyone can do it, but you have to have the will to work."
good,"La seule motivation était la rémunération, le site était loin et les bus ne font pas les trajets le dimanche donc un covoiturage est OBLIGATOIREMENT à prévoir si vous êtes en weekend. "
good,"The schedule is very flexible, the labor is hard work constantly moving. People help on another. The job security is not the best your basically a number to the system. You can lose your job off productivity. Always doing multiple things at once very tiring."
good,Do not get injured. Do not go in already having a medical condition. Do not develope a medical condition while your their. They will put you on medical leave.They will tax you till you owe on your taxes.Ultimatley they will make you quit in one way or another if you have any medical problems.
good,"Worked as Digital and devices associate being a part of work from home project (Which is mostly best for women especially mothers. "
good,"This job is great for advancing...if they let u, but if u don't keep up a very good productivity rate u won't advance. You need to be very serious work real hard and absolutely be extremely careful to not make any mistakes at all because they're sticklers for 100% quality no errors. If u have a low productivity rate or quality you'll get write ups or FIRED!"
good,"This work is for people, who not older 40 years.Work all day by squeezing the maximum possible force from itself. "
good,"The work hours were very long with was fine but they did not give workers a fair chance to use the restroom while working. If we left our station to use the restroom it would drastically affect our productivity rate, putting workers at risk to lose our job."
good,"Amazon pay is pretty good is a definite good start for somebody fresh out of high school or with no work history at all. Though they are very disorganized, and create a hostile work environment on a daily basis."
good,"la sicurezza al primo posto, la soddisfazione del cliente al secondo"
good,"Amazon is a very nice place to work and build a future, but management needs to work on the line managers the way they manage staff otherwise there is a tendency of losing staff to other companies."
good,"Every week I notice too many people standing around 1 part of the warehouse idling while other parts of the warehouse have too few people and too much work to handle.  If you're there to socialize you can.  If you're wanting heavy duty work, you can."
good,"Fast paced as I was a picker and packer, stressful at times, but really effective, helped advance many skills of mine and experience, targets are there which helped be organised."
good,I loved the jobs I did at amazon but I couldn’t stand their atmosphere. They only care about the numbers which is fine when your expected hourly rates are reasonable. After a year of the target rates going up every month or so I was let go because I had to work with an injury I sustained from constantly working at a higher and higher pace and couldn’t make rate.
good,"They hire managers straight out of college with no experience, who don't know how to manage.  They need to accept more input from employees who are performing at high levels.  Accepting their input will improve productivity."
good,"I was paid fairly for my work, but it was the only job I have ever held that I did not enjoy. The demand on employees sometimes meant injuries. That is the nature of Amazon."
good,"The days at worka are very repetitive, every day you do the same job not much variety(depends from the department as support teams have a bit more variety). The job itself is not bad, as they there are a lot of opportunities to development. There is a bid diversity."
good,Amazon a typical day when peak will start and volume is havey day by then shipment while  delivery same day and actual time while customer satisfaction is our satisfaction.
good,"came on as a picker/stower. got recognized for my high production and was promoted to amnesty technician, later on promoted to T-3 Process Assistant. Took leadership classes and was informed on how to be effective at communicating and upholding the amazon culture value."
good,nothing too complicated working at Amazon. its $15 for pretty simple work. you make your own hrs/schedule. moving up is easy it just takes time and the managers being confident in your comfort level with your new job
good,As an associate it was a nice at first. Your body has to get used to it but this fast-paced job is not for everybody so pick wisely. I’ve been there for a year and 7 months
good,"a job for introverted people, extremely boring and standing for hours. some managers were nice but some didn't care. The only good thing was the pay and the flexibility of the schedules. They also gave you plenty time off which was good."
good,This job was very high pasted. On your feet the entire 4-5hours. They treated you pretty well. Didn’t really care for certain Ambassadors. Took there job way too serious and didn’t know how to address people. There demeanor was all wrong.
good,"Good place to work, good people, low pay.  Amazon paid for my CDL training. Promised CDL driving position, never occurred. Direct management was continually being terminated for various reasons."
good,"Amazon provided a opportunity for great employee paid benefits. When I applied it was through SMX employee services  I started out at $12 per hour with a $0.50 shift premium. I was there for 3 years. Worked several different departments. Last position was problem solve & packing associate. "
good,"The experience can vary from department to department as well as the team. The recruiting in Amazon is very competitive, since they hire them every day. The worst case if you are on contract, you do feel that you are not a part of the company every day. There are rare cases when you can transfer from contract to full time job and it all depends on the team you are and the manager you have."
good,"It's the best job I've had as far as pay and benefits. The work isn't too hard nor is it too easy, but the shifts are very long. At first working here is not bad at all, it's a very good place to work. They take care of their employees and management is decent depending who you get. You will go through a lot of different managers more than likely in a short amount of time because people are always moving and changes jobs, departments, shifts, and locations. It's just how the business is run, don't get too comfortable and expect a lot of changes.  The shifts are long, although it is nice how they break it up with two 30 minute breaks once of which is a paid break. It is also really nice having a three day weekend. You have the option of working overtime there but sometimes it is required (mandatory) not voluntary, It's possible you will get very bored here very quickly. The work tends to get mindless and boring which makes your shift feel even longer, Only really worth working here if it's temporary and not long term unless you're motivated to work your way up with the company."
good,We had to Delivery packages on time & load the packages on truck. It was a really relaxing job to me I loved it. It was seasonal for we got laid on off.
good,Amazon is a good place to work as a fresher. We get to meet people with vast knowledge in software development and management. The learning curve is great since we have the flexibility to implement a solution in any technology we choose.
good,In two years I went up 6 positions in 3 departments where I was able to learn almost every role in the job.  I enjoyed my time there when it wasnt blackout.
good,"The job at amazon was extremely mindless and boring, just standing there and doing the exact same thing for 10 hours on end without really getting a chance to talk to anyone."
good,"if you arent fast enough you will most likley loose your job and be on the street, its a job if there is nothing else left on the talbe, personaly i would recommend if have no other option."
good,"Too many hours of work, not enough time out of work to advance in school studies. The hardest part of the job was the excessive walking and the work-pace they expect you to work at."
good,ADS is a process in Amazon which works like a BPO and you cannot expect freedom during your tenurity in amazon. If people who are interested in joining amazon I would recommend you to try any other process except ADS
good,"Good company but might lose the good experience because of some people. Management plays the vital role in your growth. Impress and advance. Some bad apples, but they do make the basket smell."
good,"I work as at a FC as a packer. Quota is 260 items per hour. With bathroom breaks frowned upon, only went during lunch and break time. Without taking any bio breaks (as it counts against your productivity) and not chatting with workmates, I barely broke 150 items but did break a sweat. I am a hard worker however feel the quota is excessive CONSIDERING that you can only pack as as much as the computer algorithms send to your queue and you can't control the mistakes made down earlier in the processing pipeline that hinders your rate. The math is not reflective of daily business, COO needs a cold shower. The productivity math should be adjusted to align with daily production (i.e. volume, workers and output). Come on! I'm doing the job to pay off college loans and it boggles my mind how people who work in manufacturing are treated. Meeting productivity goals are important at the FC because it can result in you loosing the job, e.g. get fired."
good,Work place is good and some of the times it is slow. Other than that a good place to work at. I enjoyed working here for seasonal but you sure do alot of walking
good,"It’s alright I don’t like the breaks they give you 2 15min breaks but you have to walk so far that you spend at least 3-4 min depending on where you are in the warehouse to get to the break room d and you have to leave the break room at least 5 min early to get back on time, so you really only getting a 6 min break."
good,"•	Multi drop driver"
good,"Zero Learnings."
good,"This location still has a fair bit of issues to settle, the work is so easy that it's actually boring, and the days end up being quite long.  However, you are paid well enough (above minimum wage) and they have a great benefits plan.  If you are looking for steady work, decent pay, good benefits, and don't mind standing for 10 hours, then this place is for you."
good,I got hired during the holiday season right before Thanksgiving I started out in Outbound packing orders to be shipped packed for about two weeks and than was moved to the sorting side of outbound. stayed there until about the spring time than was cross trained to learn Induct did that for about a week total then moved back to sort side. then by the end of summer i was trained to do SLAM
good,secured job for a person with enough salary for their pocketmoney bt not for living expenses for an year or so and good management with balancing life
good,Ok place to work if you ask me give good benefits pay is good just long hours and short break time so you have to really time mange so you won’t get left behind
good,People from ethnic ground work at Amazon but too many breaksPeople should be able to take breaks when they need it choose too.I felt like a robot working at Amazon . .
good,Ejecutan evaluaciones que no van acorde al puesto que te colocan...
good,"This is a good job for younger people. They are not consistent, you work in different areas everyday. You are on your feet 10-11 hours a day. You can work at sort one day then loading the truck the same day if area is short staffed. They always pick same people to move to other areas which is unfair."
good,"The job's pretty simple and straight forward, super easy to get adjust to in my opinion. There are some minor setbacks here and there, but you and your coworkers will have a workaround for it."
good,"Learning warehouse industry, working with heavy machinery, using forklift, processing return items and competitive scan rates. Auditing all team members processing."
good,"Keep working and if your tired, keep working harder. Great place to make you sweat. Company is based on performance, your destined to one day become a robot."
good,"A typical day includes clocking in and working with two breaks. No time for chat or socialising; not really."
good,Working here was okay its hard to move up in my opinion just from a display of lack of work ethic based on employee manager relations most the time. which a lot was based off favoritism.
good,"You really have to be a go getter and put yourself out there when working with Amazon. The opportunities to move around and learn different functions are there but you really have to be persistent and stand out from the other hundreds of employees there. Overall, fun place to work and experience the intricacies of a warehouse."
good,Amazon is a fun environment but very busy and productive as well. it has a very lively and energetic staff and coworker alike that make the time goes by really fast. The environment is amazing and working there allows you to view the products first hand.
good,"The good thing about this job as a driver has always been the freedom of the job once you pack your packages and hit the road. The problem that I am having with the job is Amazon seems to be marginalizing the job and micromanaging every aspect of the job with the added ""Mentor"" app which now adds a stipulation on a drivers ability based on predetermined and unrealistic requirements of your driving ability by the app. This app is ruining in my opinion the one thing that makes this job tolerable. I probably would not recommend unless you are really looking for work."
good,As a picker a computer told you which location and floor to go to. Sometimes you got rotten pick paths and it cost you to much time. That would cost you not to make rate. I slipped under 94 percent. They had to let me go. Good place if you can keep up.
good,Well it is okay for me because I have save alot from what I have earn so I make use of my time while working with the company so am okay with everything
good,For the most part a day wasn't all too bad. Some days would get more stressful than others but that depended sometimes on where you were assigned and how many packages were coming in that day.
good,Its a great place to work until you have to go on medical leave since they use a third-party and that's when everything goes down hill and Amazon can not really help you.
good,I worked there for a year at a logistics warehouse. The morning shift managers were nice but the overnight shift is slave work. If there aren’t enough people in your section and you’re a decent scanner prepare yourself to fill in those gaps. Sometimes you don’t even get the reconigition you deserve no matter how much you go above and beyond to help out. It’s physically hard work. You’re feet ache because you’re standing 8 hours. Lifting heavy boxes while walking on hard floor really strain your feet. The temperature in there during the hot and cold weathers are amplified. I can only say good things about the benefits after converting to blue badge and some of the managers in the morning but other than that. I was excited to join Amazon after the 15 dollar increase last year but  after learning about the physical demand that amazon requires there is no way that a company with so much money can pay there workers this littler
good,Amazon prime at Whole Foods is ok boring at times. It’s feast or famine with these jobs. Sometimes you get a lot of hours and sometimes you get none.  Sometimes it is very busy and sometimes is very slow.
good,"Clock in on time or be deducted from bonus pay or termination. I grew from the bottom of the latter to top management. Fast pace environment. Stretching's before every shift. short lunches and long hours. high stress and heavy lifting. Unexperienced  training and poor management."
good,"You clock in"
good,"the job was ok. i was a full time stower. they have good benefits, the job is fast paced and monitored. you would have to be a quick learner for this position"
good,The job went well until I got injured at work and I experienced a nightmare when trying to reach out for help. I would rate 1* or less about this whole process from working for Amazon.
good,Good pay and benefits with flexible off time. The downside is a lack of safety awareness. If you want great benefits with great pay then this is the job for you.
good,"Be cautious of company. I was a delivery driver, we faced impossible  expectations. We were expected  to deliver  200 packages in 10 hours or less. The HR is outsourced to someplace to India and they have no clue what goes in. I was drug tested for being rear ended. They told me they would call me once the results come back. I know that they results would be clean. 3 weeks passed and no call back. I called HR and they knew nothing  about what was going on. Called  my manager, who never called me back. I was getting points for being on suspension through no fault of my own. "
good,"fasted paced "
good,"Management need to improve, miscoumminication between managers/leaders, money wise very good, poor safety execution when it gets busy, oberall not bad for first job."
good,Management could have been better I really didnt like how they were managers and couldnt answer our questions when we had them. Benefits are great and so is the pay.
good,"Due to the flex up/down system Amazon has the amount of hours yoi can receive are somewhat unreliable. However, the work/life balance is great and you can basically pick a shift that works best for you"
good,bonne ambiance entre collègue  mais trop de personne se bouscule
good,"They are very strict about meeting production rates. They have Ping Pong, some Arcade games and a basketball game in the breakrooms.  During their busy season Overtime is Required."
good,For some people it is an ideal job. For others it is not. If you love warehouse jobs then this is perfect for you. Wouldn’t recommend this job for persons with a physical disability.
good,"Great place to work, open environment, & Great benefits with company. Shift options available to be flexible, 4 days on and 3 off. Very interactive with employees."
good,"Working in the morning hours is very fast paced and can be dangerous if you aren't paying attention to your surroundings or the weight of the box you are trying to lift.  Trucks are offloaded by hand and pallet jack.  The afternoon hours are not as busy and can be very boring while the deliveries are being made.  I never worked the evening hours, so I can't speak for that.  VTO was nearly offered at a daily basis as well so that can be considered a plus or minus. Also, you are entitled to an Amazon.com employee discount (so long as it is sold from them and not a 3rd party)."
good,"amazon is fast paced, must meet rates everyday! the environment is fair, they have lockers vending machines! refridgerator and microwaves! very good security"
good,Overall I would say this is a good place to make quick cash but not pleasant to work at. You get a 30 minute lunch and two 15 minute breaks but the break rooms are far from your work station.
good,"They do have great benefits, however the work can be physically demanding.   Long 10 hr days and lots of overtime, amounting to 50 to 60 hour work week.  Hard to move up in company for higher paying position. Starting wage is $15 an hour but they do not give raises till you are there for 18+ months.   Not a hard job to learn, just have to be fast."
good,Management needs work. Fast pace Job. It pays well. Opportunity to advance. Plenty of overtime to pick up. Alot of helpful resources and discounts available to employees.
good,Great Company to work for....just not forever.....If you're in a pinch and need a great paying job with great benefits then this is the place to work!
good,Co-workers are great and supportive management seems to focus more on the numbers of everything at the facility I work at which may bit be the case at all Amazon facilities
good,I didn't like it because of the hours and the schedule was not good time frame but was a pretty easy job I always got my job done bybthevend of my shift oh yeah I was working only four hours a day and still wasn't making enough for you to live off.
good,"A very busy workplace. Friendly staff."
good,I had to leave due to personal issues but other than that amazon is a great place to work and learn new skills. It will also show you and prepare you for a fast pace work   Environment.
good,Low pay for work being done. Some amazing people at this company and very bright minds. Would definitely recommend working here long term if wiling to put in the time and advance in your career.
good,I was not prepared to pull inventory items for 60 hours a week. The work was totally oriented about meeting the daily quota.  The day started with how much can you pic in minutes.  They emphasized quantity over quality.
good,"Not a bad spot to work for fresh out of highschool or college students who need the extra cash. The management & work culture could be a bit better, very customer focused environment."
good,"Rates too high, set by corporate exec who have no idea. Good pay, mgrs, schedule, benefits. Unfortunately, in certain departments your set up to fail."
good,very good to work for and can get hold off if you need the time off and very pleasant all staff cares for the workers  10/11 hour shifts hardest part of the job is getting used to the hours that u work
good,"I was hired in full-time. It's easy to move up, but it's hard work. Love a lot of the people there. But it's very unprofessional as a warehouse. Management is not the best, but it's a new and growing company."
good,"Amazon is a good place to work if you don't have anything else to do with your life. They call 10-12 hour mandatory overtime shifts constantly because they're such a big company that they can't seem to keep up with demands.  All the shifts are 10+hours as well. If you have no life and don't mind giving up your days off, great. If you like keeping your off days as your actual off days, don't even bother."
good,Speedy onboarding process as well as smooth the online application was very user friendly and the orientation was also nice with lots of very friendly and helpful staff
good,"J'ai travaillé deux mois pour Amazon sur le site de Lauwin Planques en temps que préparateur de commande et chargé de mise en stock. Travail très répétitif et exigeant (7 h consécutifs avec une pause de 30mn seulement). "
good,Loved the site but the people could be non productive and blame others for mistakes instead the right person. Training was on your own. Better training is need.
good,"Too work based. As a stower you are required to maintain a certain rate. If you don't, you'll get written up. Some of the stowers contemplate on using the restroom because they don't to mess up the rate. It's also hot. Very boring."
good,"7:30am start 6pm finish. Two 30 mins break (in reality its two 10min breaks - due to the shear size of the fc, in order to enter a safe zone it is a good walk to get to the canteen). They want you to go at inhumane rapid speeds in order to make more money. Due to this and the amount of resting time available your energy gets drained drastically. At the odd times employees where shoved into an ambulance and frankly never returned despite the fairly good wages. Management in my experience were just stubborn and never helped me overcome any problems I was facing. Always showing me ""tips"" or ""tricks"" to go faster when what I needed was a toilet break. Oh and in order for you to advance you need to be in the top 10 fastest in the department (out of 100+ employees - not realistic). Only enjoyable part of the job is when you see that deposit in your account. It kinda makes it worth it."
good,"Amazon was a nice place to work, I loved saying i worked at Amazon because its one of the biggest company's in the world. it was a shame it was a temporary position or else i would still be there now."
good,"I learned very key components about warehouse work. I had good teachers who cared about the company and the customer. The culture was good, a team effort was always given. The lesson learned at amazon i will be able to apply to other jobs for the rest of my life."
good,Be more understanding of others situations. Find more ways to allow workers to take SERIOUS request off. Overall still a very good company to work for
good,"working in Amazon allowed for a flexible working pattern for university students, night shift gave decent pay and overtime pay was increased to time and a half and double. and there were always opportunities for promotions. during peak times."
good,"company is good at working to allow you to transfer you to whichever schedule works for you best, but only after working there for a certain amount of time. Promotions are not advertised very well and you can only apply through a computer directly connected to their network"
good,"It’s a good part-time job. Although there isn’t really an option to go full time which kind of sucks. You pick when you work, but everyone else does as well. Each day shifts are posted and are gone in around 1 minute so you have to be there waiting to get them. Overall it’s a good job, I just wish full time was more feasible."
good,"Fun environment to work in, Meeting new students and introducing them to the benefits of Amazon Prime. Great job to have alongside studying at the university."
good,"come to work place my things in the locker go and fill a water bottle, clock in see exactly where my team would be having the daily meeting. meet up with all of the team members do a short exercise, go to my assigned area clock in the machine and get to work. go on my first 15 min brk by time i reach the brk room already time to turn back around no matter what location you are in it is a very far commute from your position to the brk room. turm back around and go back to my work station work, go to lunch for about 15 because it almost takes that long to hit the break room then when the bell goes off head back to my position. work go on my last 15 min brk and get back to work by the middle of the night ,my body is really worn out can barely climb the stairs to get back to my position or to head home. absolutely all energy is drained before the middle of the shift ends."
good,"4/10s, exhausting, fast paced. breaks aren't long enough, rates need to be hit every day. very fast paced, always Gotta be moving. drink lots of water."
good,"company focuses more on production level rather than employee awareness, not much room for career progression but a good learning experience. The job teaches you how to think on your feet considering that you could be placed in a different department at any time. Easy to get along with coworkers which makes the job alot less painful"
good,they make it really hard to become full time. the pay is decent (higher than minimum wage so that's nice).  The managers were all very friendly and helped with learning the job skills.
good,I dont spend time in the breakroom but theres a lot of games and different snacks to buy. The workers are friendly. The work environment ain't the best and the pay could be better but atleast the health plan is good.
good,"sono stato nel magazzino per 3 mesi, mi sono trovato bene tutto sommato, bravi colleghi sempre pronti ad aiutarti, staff affiatato, bravi manager."
good,"They work you  extremely hard for 10 hours and micro manage your every move. The benefits are great and that is good because you may need a short term disability after 5 years. I enjoy the people the most there. They give out prizes for hard work, but unfair in the process of distributing those prizes."
good,"The factory workers are treated like slave mules. Can't relieve yourself for five minutes in a bathroom without being scrutinized. No air conditioning in the summer inside the warehouses but they make sure their Office workers do. If you need the money. It will pay the bills,that's it.Constantly long hours. You sleep most of your days off. No work balance. Management pushes the warehouse workers to the brink of physical injury. Constant surveillance. They treat their workers like they are potential thieves."
good,"Be prompt"
good,"Employé chez Amazon depuis 2016, j'ai pu constater un manque de communication et de transparence entre les employés et les managers. En effet, les managers sont constamment à la recherche d'une productivité maximale sans se préoccuper des demandes des employés, obligeant parfois ces derniers à enfreindre certaines règles de sécurité."
good,it was a job that was repetitive. nothing special. just put the boxes where they needed to be in the time frame that you are given. the long 10 to 12-hour shifts are the hardest part.
good,basato molto sul teamwork. ambiente stimolante che insegna a risolvere problemi con il gruppo
good,"There are working a lot of diferent people from diferent countrys, but there is no rasism or something like that. Quiet busy but nice atmosphere. Would love to come back next years"
good,"There were busy as well as laid-back days, depending on the volume of incoming and outgoing tractor-trailers. I learned to communicate with drivers of many cultures, which prepared me for a multicultural workforce beyond Amazon. "
good,"First job for me, but employees are overworked and held to strict rules. Not an overly difficult job, but tedious and demanding. A lot of people are temps so there are a lot of inexperienced workers. They also let a lot of people go when their peak season is over. There are a lot of interesting people but I do not see myself going back. I also would not recommend to anyone close to me looking for a serious job."
good,Amazon is a cool job to have if your in between jobs and if you like long hours. Management sucked when i worked there; they definitely was not on the same page when it came to communication and also had favorites.
good,"You have to stand up the entire night. They tell you that you get two 15 minute breaks but they are really 10 minutes because we only have 2 and half minutes to walk from your work station and back to your work station. When the truck has like 30000 packages (which isn't alot) they start to send large amounts of people home, and the remaining people end up having around triple the work to do. It sucks."
good,"First and foremost, I'm an Amazon warehouse associate; more specifically, Amazon Fresh associate. If you plan on coming into a chill, laid back working environment, that's the wrong mindset to have if you're going to apple here. A lot of walking and heavy lifting. This job really pushes your body to it's limits, and that's not even mentioning the various climate changing here. Throughout the day you'll either be in 60-70 degree weather(ambient area), 40-30 degree weather(chill area), or literally in below zero temperature(freezer area). These combinations along with irritable and over eager management will put a strain on your body over time. Overall? If you aren't built for this type of working environment I would not recommend this job."
good,"For the most part the job itself was okay. Trainers made you feel right at home until I was hired on. After you leave training I wish they would have told you not speak to them or attempt to say hello or good morning. The work was back breaking. I tore muscles in my back and shoulders within the first couple months working there. My manager was very helpful with walking me through the process and getting me the help I needed. I actually ended up leaving because my injury. Even with a 2 dollar hike, I don't think it's worth the work you do."
good,"The managers have very high expectations of all employees, the pay and Benefits are good,the work life balance is good with 4 days on 3 days off however the shifts are long 11 hours altogether."
good,Managers does not help out with work. Most employees who are cool with the managers sit around and talk most of the times. There are maybe 10 people total on my shift which leaves us to do double the work. Just not a good  system.
good,It was an okay job. My supervisors were a bit laid back. It was a really straight forward job that pays well in proportion to the skill level required.
good,Amazon Is Good company Where you can learn new skills as far as pallet jacking & move up in your positions it’s an easy Fast pace job depending on your position there .
good,Fast paced work environment. Must be flexible to with the shift hours.  Opportunities for extra hours are available.  Prime season is very busy and gives the chance for additional time.
good,"The only part of Amazon I really hated was loading the Amazon trucks. Truly horrible for me. Other than that, the pay was good, and I got to pick my own hours."
good,"Very fast paced, however compared to a few years ago getting hired here isn't the easiest, anything on your record and your an automatic out no way to appeal or explain and try to give you a chance, even their hired contractors with their own vehicles are denied automatically. Kind if stupid I think, I strongly believe as long as you don't have theft, or violent records and if you have 1 thing from 5 years before you should at least be given the same opportunity or chance to have a job with them."
good,Will have good opportunity to learn more things. Management is good. Working hours are also flexible. Guidance by the seniors is good. Overall a good company.
good,"Good money but not worth it."
good,our station is now outsourcing our jobs and we seem to be in limbo. Unsure what will happen.Management is not being forthcoming with information about what will happen to us.
good,se pasa rapido ya que siempre hay mucho trabajo y el dia pasa rapido los compaeros eran muy agradables lo unico malo es la poca estabilidad de estar mucho tiempo trabajando alli
good,"Service satisaisant "
good,"A typical day at Amazon is stressful.Poor communication with management. The hardest part of this job is being on your feet for 10 hours a day, having short time breaks.What I did enjoy is that you get to meet different people."
good,not a dull place to work at times can be stressful the hours are long and need to be adjusted to 8 hour work days and a five day work week instead of four ten hour days
good,"Pro:"
good,"I worked at Amazon in sorting facility around Christmas 2017. They expected us to work fast, sometimes faster than I could handle. It was usually OK, but sometimes trucks full of stuff would arrive near the end of the shift, and everyone would have to stay until they were done. I'm not faulting the company for this, but I think people should know how crazy things can get before they go in."
good,"I work within the Prime Now sector of Amazon where my primary location to report to work is at Whole Foods on Ponce de Leon in Atlanta, Ga. I grocery shop for customers, pack their orders, stage them for delivery drivers for pick up and wahlah! Groceries at their door step."
good,"Good paying job "
good,"Amazon is fine. I just do not like the call center environment. I got along great with all the staff and my fellow workers. I miss the people I worked with. I did not think management was all that great, though some were willing to help you get through."
good,"we work 10 hour days, 4 days a week. the floors were pretty dusty, we had to clean them everyday. they are getting 1 lunch and 1 break soon. punch in and stretch out and go to your assigned spot. management were pretty much on you at first till you gotten faster at your job. I had fun w/ my co workers."
good,"I was hired as a Seasonal Fresh Associate. You're basically working nonstop on your feet. Work consists of putting away and unboxing items or packaging different groceries for customers. People are really competitive here; they take this job very seriously. Sometimes I felt like I was lagging behind because of how fast-paced everyone was. There is also a point system, if you reach a certain amount of points, you could be fired. You're told that you can pick your own schedule but there literally hasn't been any to choose from. So I basically haven't gone back to work since my 2 weeks of training, which is pretty strange to me."
good,"5-6 days a week, up to 14 hours a day. They worked everyone to death. When I first started here, they made Amazon sound quite peachy, 4 days on 3 days off. This changed very fast!"
good,"Amazon is a high intensity competitive and fast past paced environment. Amazon employs a high rate at which workers must meet or face termination, the rates are high but in no way impossible unless your new to the job and at that point you have 1 week to get up to rate or you won’t see a second month."
good,- This is a new job which is not my major but I like new challenge. I is great to work with writers and evaluate them if they are right to my blog. This job doesn't require experience of IT major.
good,the hardest part was standing the same spot for hours and not being able to move around a lot. The enjoyable part was the making the money and the breaks.
good,"Normal workplace working with a scanner and picking Items."
good,Typical work day would start out with shift meeting or as they call it stand up when we do stretches and get information for our shift that day.  Then we would start load out for our flex drivers or if you where not picked for that you would reset the floor for the shift that night.
good,It's like a prison but good pay but not for 12hr shifts and to be back on the dot. With only 10mins brake if your lucky *lights don't work *vending machine is never working *drinking machine is also rubbish *food has been left out too long and don't taste nice at all
good,great work experience.Learn how to make new friends. Management is pretty cool. Fast pace workplace. Hardest part of this job is keeping your numbers up.
good,stressful space to work  for. I don't like to be close up all the time. Employees in the warehouse are seeing like just workers not real people. It's just a normal warehouse job
good,Don't be late from breaks meet you hourly goals. The managers are very strict  about your work and time off task. It is very easy to be fired from amazon due to these factors
good,"Stricte sur la sécurité de leurs employé, possibilité de proposé des idées afin d'amélioré a sécurité"
good,"Easy if you're looking for a part time or seasonal gig. It is physically demanding, but probably an easier environment than many other fulfillment center if you can keep on your toes."
good,Ambiente Extenuante pero con una cultura laborar Excelente.
good,If you put your head down and show up for work with a decent attitude it's not that bad. It is stressful but you figure out how your leeway pretty quickly. overall not a bad job.
good,"Short shifts make for low hours, but if the set shifts work for you then this part time job will be fine. Never know exactly when the shift will end each day, depends on business need. Great people and there are work activities planned, especially during peak months. Not a bad part time job as long as you can work with the set hours, although injuries are too common."
good,"You have to move very fast. Whenever you scan packages away into a bag, you need to make sure you meet rate. The job itself is not hard. The part that I disliked the most was picking the routes for drivers."
good,Working for Amazon you get the impression that everything was designed by someone who has been given a very detailed account of humans and their society but never actually met one.
good,"Overall, if you want to make money and don't mind the long hours, then this the right place for you. In fact, you might just get a promotion before other people that have worked there longer."
good,"There is no two days that are the same because you are shaping tomorrow today. You are always in a state of a futuristic start up and things are always evolving. "
good,"Amazon Fulfillment pays good and can be somewhat flexible with hours and gives plenty of options for time off. 10 hour days, 4 days, Two 15 minute breaks and 30 minute lunches. They want employees to work at their high rate and expect you to keep up the pace or else you'll get phased out."
good,"When it comes to Amazon Fulfillment, it's about 3 things: Location. Location. Location. Some are great. Some are not. Unfortunately, locations are typically pragmatically determined by your home neighborhood unless one wants to commute for 90+ minutes. If one doesn't like to work, don't apply because you will hate it and not last long."
good,Hardest part of the job was the long hours and short break periods. Then to see a revolving door of new employees constantly getting hired and fired. The job was very easy though.
good,I worked for a team in Dedham and the supervisors gives local routes and some routes are shorter than others which can make it a little unfair for others.
good,"Typical day at work was busy and it helped the time go by fast, I was fortunate to be assigned to a respectful and fair supervisor. The hardest part of the job for me being short, I was frequently assigned to an area that did not have the platform and a lot of the time a tall person would have that assigned to them."
good,"Fast paced, warehouse environment. Must be flexible in learning new positions throughout the day and week. Mandatory overtime sporadically through the year and guaranteed mandatory overtime during Q4."
good,"I'm thankful for the opportunity to contract at Amazon, but glad it is going to be short term. I think it's true that work life balance depends on what team you are on, so if you're concerned about that it's worth interviewing and asking them."
good,"Your personal life will be non existence if you are to work night shift. You literally have no time to recover from the emotional, mental drainage since the hours you get are unconventional and weird."
good,"You are expected to push to your limit and increase it every hour, There is a three strike limit throughout your employment or per year whichever is sooner, half point for not keeping up (per shift, ) or being late at your post.  Lunch time is half hour but takes 15 mins to get to your locker where all your belongings are to be left."
good,"The work place is a fun place to be and the growth is much faster than most companies. However, most of the time there are a bit of favouritism involved and the hours are terrible."
good,Your experience will depend on the specific team and the manager. My suggestion if to evaluate yourself every 3 months and change teams if the current team is not working out for you.
good,The workplace is small but not unmanageable. Few of the supervisors are motivating or capable at making it feel like a non stressful workplace. The workplace is highly competitive with emphasis being put on this by the supervisors. Machinery would constantly break down or jam causing a backup. The large break rooms for lunch were enjoyable for the 1 hour lunch. Very little flexibility with individuals attempting to go to school and work.
good,"Over the span of the 9 months I worked there, the first 3 months weren't too bad. After it hit the 9 month mark that's when things just didn't seem worth it anymore. The thing about working at a warehouse that people don't seem to notice is the thought of emptiness. After the long 9 month the feeling of progressing in life fades and your stuck with a simple job that has no meaning plus being labeled as sort of a number. The only things is can think of that benefited me was the income, benefits, and weight loss. Outside of work the balance of work and life is terrible.Say you work the night shift 6:30PM-5:00AM you work 10 hours, go home use about another 3 hours or so to do things at home like eat, feed dog, etc, then you finally go to sleep. you wake up at 3-4ish and now you have to get ready for work. Overall the job is really a 50/50, with good income, benefits and weight loss but at the cost of life interactions."
good,"It's a pretty physical job that may take you a while to adjust to, depending on how active you are. You would think that the work is mind-numbing but you're constantly running around and you're always double checking information of some sort. To me, it's best if taken for extra cash."
good,"Great place"
good,"Usually treat you like a pokemon card in retro-spec when you're trained in multiple areas. ""Hey I need so and so to fill a pack spot because employee B is too slow/or left early"". Managers care and try their best to help on day to days. Takes a couple years to advance and pay isn't all too compensating. Tier system is okay for pay increase, but here in CA need a bit more for cost of living. Great first job or management job if you qualify. Salary + stocks every 6 months for managers is a no brain-er. If you're fresh out of high school, they will whip you into the working worlds shape, (literally you will lose weight!). Benefits are really good, they need to be so when they break you, you wont spend a dime to come back to work for them soon after."
good,"When i was there it was 12 an hour. The bosses stood with their watches "" tagging "" those who were late, even if was a minute. At the current pay rate(15.00), im sure they even more ""choosy"""
good,Je mehr man gearbeitet hat umso sicherer war es dass man nicht übernommen wird.Man hat sich gefühlt als sei im Management gewürfelt worden wer übernommen wird und wer nicht.Mit Leistungen überzeugt man hier nicht.Alle schnell und gut arbeitenden Mitarbeiter durften nach dem Weihnachtsgeschäft gehen.Statt dessen wurden im Januar 50 neue Kräfte per Arbeitsamt gesucht.Wenn man sich dann wieder bewirbt heißt es frühestens in einem Jahr wieder.
good,"Currently working at the JAX 3 warehouse.  I had never worked in a warehouse ever so it was all new to me.  Before the raise to $15 an hour, I would have said the pay does not compensate you for the work.  However $15 seems fair to me (although I have no other warehouse experience to compare it to).  The health benefits are actually really great, very low cost for great health care (I am on the share deductible plan).  Keep in mind, although $15 an hour is great, ALL employees are getting that.  So the person who doesn't do their part, gets $15.  The 'injured, requiring light duty forever', gets $15.  If that is going to bother you, don't work here.  I hear the regulars complain (funny that it's socialism at work and now they don't like it when it's happening to them lol)  The work is very physically demanding but I happen to like being active all day long.  The breaks are too short, 30 minutes for lunch just flies by you have to eat fast.  Most of the rumors I had heard are not true, like no bathroom breaks, too many people racing to get to time clocks or lunch room.  Not true.  They stagger the shifts to avoid that.  I don't like being on the equipment but everyone gets trained on it no matter what.  Now on to my biggest complaint:  Management.  They literally have kids right out of college trying to tell people how to run a warehouse with zero experience.  I'm being very honest here.  Their are so many qualified, experience people who could have that warehouse running so smoothly and why Amazon officials do not use them I do not know.  The 'kids' in charge are really just"
good,"Had great benefits, no real job security. Amazon was overall not caring about us as employees. It was rough working there under the conditions of having to rush in everything we do. Injuries were bound to happen and they never cared."
good,A typical day at Amazon was like a day of working out at the gym. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet new people. The hardest part of the job was getting use to the labor
good,"I just started working for Amazon for 2 weeks, already I had points/time taken away from me and its was my day off...Payday finally came and I still haven't received my check yet...So far just gave me the runaround...They want you to stow 188 package and hour...Who does that on their first night, manager yeld at me for something I had nothing to do with..Site has only 2 bathrooms 1 on each side and it's far from wherever you are...This job is only good for making extra cash or if ur looking for a job real quick for the time being....Other than that...Ehhh, it's ok to a point...."
good,"It is a good place to start to introduce them to fast pace and stressful situations. Advancement opportunities are slow and have to outshine others. The culture there though is amazing, there are a lot of different cultures and everyone is a family."
good,"Good place to work , steady job , co-workers are very helpful."
good,I thought it was a good place to work but like any place it did have its issues but overall a great place to work. It offered a friendly environment but was very fast paced.
good,"The benefits are good, but you'll need a thick skin to deal with the bad choices made by the higher ups in your work environment. It would be nice if leadership did less watching and pointing and more working on the floor."
good,"Amazon is fine. When I started several years ago I believed they were the best company around. The problem is that they’ve grown so big, so fast. Other companies have taken what only Amazon was doing 5-10 years ago and exceeded it. Amazon’s massive and rapid growth has prevented them from adapting to current employee expectations. "
good,"the job is fun,the people are good its just the management are sort of prejudice against certain people.they don't know how to communicate with people."
good,"You have to be a very hard worker, and like physical exertion. It is an impersonal place to work because of the number system they work off of _ it is motivating but unfair. Everything is based off of the number of items you scan. Someone could scan numerous packages ,and leave you with a big mess to organize, bringing your numbers down. Being a conscientious worker is not exactly, valuable to the managers because they are only looking for High Scan Numbers. You must be competitive to stay alive!"
good,Good starter job or in between jobs. I would definitely go back there to work and I do recommend others to apply. The benefits and hours are great. Great place.
good,"Good if you have nothing to do, good benefits. Management is lenient and friendly, nice atmosphere, but it gets very repetitive. Paid time off, vacation time and unpaid time."
good,"In amazon ho imparato a collaborare in team. La parte più impegnativa del mio lavoro, probabilmente è stata l'apprendimento dell'uso del computer."
good,don't know what to say except what I said below you choose your hours you want to work if you want to work overtime that is up to you they don't give you sick pay but plenty of paid time off
good,The work is stressful. You have to meet rates and find yourself working your fastest and most draining to meet them. There is no music and some of the workers are very rude considering the stress to meet the rates. It is too much room to think and be in your head. By the time i'm done a 10 hour shift with nothing but my thoughts to listen to i find myself feeling delusional.
good,"ok money.  "
good,"The job is easy to learn and manage but can get repetitive. "
good,Customer obsessed job. Helping drivers to deliver and answer customer needs. Nice to see a company who tries to give training and make the employees participate in the improvement of the workplace.
good,"Amazon is an awesome place to work,with great understanding management and Human Resources. Benefits are awesome! Amcare/ Saftey is awesome and very patient. The pay could be much better."
good,A typical day at work consisted of morning exercises in the department in which you worked 5 minutes after the start time. We would perform our work standing in one spot  grabbing items behind us and package them into boxes. We would have 2 15 minute breaks that started once it's announced and the same policy for lunch.
good,"This job was good for some experience, I went to work Tuesday-Saturday 2pm-7pm and over time the job just got more repetitive. I worked here 3 months and tried tog get my scheduled switched multiple times and got denied. So now I'm looking for a new job that isn't repetitive and very out going company."
good,"The job isn't hard at all just very very repetitive. Most workers say it is modern day slavery. A typical day includes safety tips, standard work tips, quality tips, and success stories to begin. You then go to your assigned workstation and attempt to meet production needs. I learned that a steady pace is ideal for meeting production. Management is helpful some days, though you will find managers just socializing with other managers and employees."
good,Mir hat es spass gemacht auch war eine eigene Kantine von Vorteil die Arbeitszeiten waren in Ordnung es ist aber viel mit laufen zu tun und Orientierung aber ansonsten war es gut
good,las normas de trabajo son claras pero al final solo importa hacer buenos números y se mira a otro lado mientas salga adelante el trabajo.
good,Part time work hours were chilled with plenty of overtime during peak season which is winter there are some passive aggressive management but other than that it’s cool and social and sometimes fast pace.  Believe there are some benefits for students also by the way. No farther comment.
good,"Amazon is a productive work place but offers no true job security, shifts are on a first come first serve basis. You are not guaranteed a shift as you have to make your own schedule and pick your own hours. The concept is good if you are a student/looking for a second job. Only managers are allowed full time positions the rest are part time. Pay is slightly above minimum (MA)  but you get no annual raise, your pay stays the same."
good,"The amazon warehouse job is a fast paced environment but really relaxed (as far as attire). They promote work life balance, advancement of education, etc. However I was let go after 3 months with no explanation."
good,Amazon was a great place to work for for a while. It had its ups and down but it was still a good place to work. Management was fair. they treated their employees with respect.
good,Very routine and diverse group of co-workers. Atmosphere did not have a family vibe as much as they tried to make it so. Too much pressure to increase the pace of the workers to meet the quota.
good,"I was excited about working at Amazon. The company offers great benefits and there is excellent room for advancement.. I just happen to be placed 36 ,miles from home and the culture was not accepting of my political and religious views and there was a covert culture of racism. I was actually called a bad hombre by one of the other employees. Good Company but not good for me"
good,Amazon is a decent job if one wants something immediate in order to look for another job with carer advancement. The job is physically demanding and must have the stamina to maintain it. Otherwise a good place to build tolerance for long hours and hard work. Pleasant atmosphere and friendly co workers and managers.
good,"Becoming a Warehouse Associate is not very difficult. However, that does not mean the job is easy. This job involves walking all day at a quick pace. It would be difficult for someone that cannot be active. The basics of the job are very simple but there are consequences for slacking off and falling below the daily required rate. They are also very strict with being on time."
good,It is super easy to get hired on. It is also super easy to want to not be hired on. Pay is average. Benefits are above average. Attrition is too high.
good,I enjoy the medical benefits that were provided.In my time there I  learned the operations of Amazon. The cultural was not conducive for me. I did not like the 10 hr shift.
good,"Amazon is a fast growing company, so there is always a lot to do. On a typical day I would take calls from customers and help them with their problems. I learned to be patient with the people on the other end of the phone when I call a company customer service department. Amazon is a nice place to work, it is just time for me to move on and get a job in my field of study."
good,"Arrive early, attend stand up which includes stretching and current updates for the upcoming shifts, along with safety reminders and sometime unexpected area of assignment changes. Short lunch and then dismissal."
good,"Mein Praktikum möchte ich gerne in Ihrem Unternehmen machen, da Sie für den eigenen Bedarf ausbilden und dadurch eine, eventuelle, Übernahme nach dem Praktikum möglich ist."
good,If your looking for a job to transition into another position then Amazon will work for you. Most jobs are 10 hour days 4 days a week otherwise its 12 hour days 3 days a week. They constantly change their expectation of how much you are to put out production wise. It is a very physically demanding job almost like being at the gym 10 hours a day 4 days a week.
good,"They make money, they sell things, they always need more buyers. The end. They make money, they invest it in commodities including labor. They have a tiered employment system. They make more commodities including media for circulation of commodities they don't directly own. Sell sell sell. Back to the start."
good,Amazon was a casual and productive place to work where you got to pick your hours and schedule and how much you wanted to work. The break room was efficient and spacious. It was a very diverse place with people from many backgrounds working there.
good,The Management is horrible.  People with no experience in management and or leadership background. Alot of the management was either military or college kids.
good,it has its ups and downs. paid sick time even as a part time employee is great. expect to have terrible coworkers and no accountability. management is often oblivious to problems and do not take any action to solve them. overall it is relaxed although very fast paced. you will not have any down time at all and the work is constant but reasonable. i am very qualified for many positions that have been offered but less qualified people will get promoted because they sweet talk the managers. if you dont suck up to them you will not be promoted and that is unethical in my opinion.
good,Amazon is a job that keeps you i your toes you definitely have to be prepared for the walking and pulling carts if you are a stower and if you work the night shift it is a little hard
good,"Management was always focused on productivity numbers and even though the facility always made it's numbers they would continually raise the bar to the extent people became overly stressed and obsessed with the posting of productivity numbers. The workplace culture was very competitive and somewhat cutthroat, hourly employees tried to be sympathetic to one another but it was pretty much everyone for themselves.The most difficult part of the job was productivity numbers were always being raised even when business was slow. The most enjoyable part of the job was the very people you worked next to packing everyone was in the same boat sort of speak so having a sense of humor made the job much more tolerant."
good,Very strict on rules depending on what they are. Rules change often threatening job security.  Managers and expectations change often. TEIR 3 JOBS are a lot easier at least physically to teir 1 jobs.
good,"3rd shift working night till day,"
good,I was working part time at one point which allowed job flexibility. Decent job. My only issue was there was too many changes at hand whereby I fed them feel secure about the job
good,"Salaire très peut élevé par rapport au travaille exigé, bonne accueille, très bon suivi de candidat en partenariat avec Marine Adequat."
good,"Inbound/outbound. Pick and pack. Scanning."
good,"A typical day at work would involve a lot of lifting."
good,"exhausting work of 10-12 hours of your feet in a semi-tempered environment."
good,"It is good place to work with good work environment and ethics.Salary is good."
good,"Unless you plan on making a career at Amazon, use it until you find something better. "
good,"Fast paced work environment, an friendly people. the breaks are very short , an not enough time to eat.  Its mentally draining an physically. They work you like robots."
good,A nice place to work in but need to be more consistent in everyday work activities. need to understand that basic rules they set in place applies differently depending on situation with that being said upper management has no dealings with there employees except working them like robots. The people working there have lives and when a rule is challenge they get rid of you with no write up or warning.
good,Overall good place to work good benefits but I feel they choose who they know not the qualified for job advancement.  People I work with are amazing. The hourly salary is not enough for amount of work you do or for cost of living.
good,Nothing special I don’t know I don’t care this job has nothing to do with me stop asking me about this place I don’t work here anymore I moved on I don’t plan on going back
good,"The hours there are killer when you have a family. and though they say they understand and will work with you, most of the time they would rather let you go when something happens then be understanding. was not a good place to work for in my opinion."
good,a really cool job that's sort of flexible. You just can't get sick or need any change in your schedule randomly. They don't understand those things and you can potentially get fired.
good,"Amazon is not the worst place to work, but also not the best. They do offer many opportunities for cross-training. The hours are long and the jobs are monotonous. They are very strict when it comes to time off task, this includes the time it takes to walk across the building to use the restroom. Benefits are great, but something has to be considering the long hours. Not recommended for those who like to spend time with their families."
good,"The culture and environment were very fast paced and monotonous. Management was diverse and  very acute, depending on the area you worked in.However there were times that reflected that it;s not what you know, but who. This company is very hands off. Centric around technology and providing potential ""employees "" an opportunity to be relaxed for interviews via web portal services. While working onsite, it's very difficult to have issues resolved the same day or  with the same personnel. Everything seems to revolve around e-mails and information provided by  corporate.Procurement of paper work and accurate reports seem to be an issue where I worked. Issues ranging from improper documentation of reports on employees thru managing  Labor companies were rampant. The partnered company instituted it's personnel to integrate with Amazon employees which made for a difficult reference when training employees on the correct  way to work and safety issues.This maybe due to the generation gap between Millennial's and the more experienced employee on  business procedures, etiquette and functionality.This in turn has led to  a massive turnover rate, that deminishes the possibilities of calling Amazon home for multiple years. Strict scheduling and time deadlines combined with huge warehouses make it more likely be disappointed and frustrated with working here.The hardest part of the job is to understand what's needed and working with inexperienced management staff. The majority of which were' promoted"" based on there production efforts and numbers and have no sense of corporate structure. ie..HR."
good,"it is good but the staff whom are above you treat the employees like dirt they also like to make you feel as little as possible when speaking to you and if you was in the right they do everything in there power to make you have a bad day "
good,"Working at Amazon was at best, an interesting experience. Your co-workers are fair, the environment is nice, and the atmosphere is safe. However the management is very questionable to me. I've seen workers, veterans that been working there for years, get terminated for the wrong reasons. Im sure not all Amazon fresh factories are like that but the one I worked for had questions managers."
good,"Fast going environment. Fun, clean, and well organized environment. It goes by how many products you make per day, week, or month. I hate the idea because it never give the employees any time to relax. If someone slowdown, it going to affect his score. If someone's score is low his is going to get layoff."
good,"Very hectic but they get things done. Managers are personable and friendly, understanding. Fast paced working environment with competitive employees and a lot of opportunity."
good,"Amazon is a fast paced environment, but it was hard to transfer shifts. Work became monotonous after a while. It is difficult to advance but had good pay and benefits."
good,"Long hard hours and felt like a robot at times. Repeat motion, standing on feet all day, lack of speaking on lines, rate requirement. Only work at the warehouse if desperate. Location parties got cheaper because the Main office wanted to be cheap."
good,"Amazon is a great resume builder. This isn't likely a career job. Healthcare is excellent, good stock options and retirement as well. Repetitive mind numbing work. Low pay with extremely small raises. open door policy where you can speak to anyone about anything but something as simple as light bulbs being out is still never fixed."
good,I was just looking for a job didn't know o would be foreced to do this after uploading my resume. I just want a new job this in no way can help me further my career
good,Walking 15-18 miles a day. Management only cares about themselves. They treat their employees like garbage. They need to change  how it is runned to make people want to stay there
good,Amazon is not for the lazy individual looking for a free paycheck.  It is a fast paced environment. I truly enjoyed working with my associates in Inbound and ICQA functions.
good,"not to much advancement in the company, sometimes fun and fast pace, but it was an experience for me. i learned how to read the RF scanner. and order selection. but people were and supervisor were nice. the hardest thing i had ever done is pushing totes around to order pickers and the best thing about the job was getting to meet new people."
good,"Overall it just depends, they offer great benefits but only full-time and they allow you to switch shifts(e.g. Nights to Mornings) but they are all four days of work being 10 hours each with three days off (not always off three days in a row) and sometimes have mandatory overtime which would be either an 11 or 12 hours shift thus leaving only two days off.  So, on your days off you are tired and sore and don't want to go out at all and when it is time to go back to work you finally feel somewhat relaxed but also realize you have to go back to work the same day. Work-life balance is not that great and there is lots of repetition in the warehouse job. The base pay is $13.25 an hour but as a warehouse worker, I expected to get at least $15 an hour especially since there is a lot of reaching, bending and lifting heavy objects. So like I said it just depends on you but for me, it just was not worth working there and if you ever work there you can see on other peoples faces how exhausted and overworked they are and it almost feels like a legal sweatshop."
good,Pay is ok. the Compensation package is reasonable. liked having the stock options. if you are really in need of a job its a decent place to work. but if you could get by without it so be it.
good,"Highly accountable, data driven and task oriented.  There are lot of opportunities to rotate and try new areas of the business.  Working hard is part of the culture."
good,Management is really helpful working there was fun fast paced job  I got TDR  license  while working there   Trailer duck and release Part time job over all Good experience
good,the worst thing about the breaks were you had 15 minutes for break time including walking to bathroom and break room  a break rooms were at least 10 minutes from work area. So you would have to power walk for break then stand on your feet for the rest of your shift. Other than that i can deal with the job
good,Benefits are good however the pay compensation for this fast paced pace job is not in line with the amount of work we do and the cost of living for this area.
good,"Different tasks usually everyday according to floor manager."
good,Great people but expect a lot of their employees without any true direction. Too many policy changes to keep up with. Was weekend part time but discontinued position and did it over a YouTube video... they offered us part timers full time but for much less then the part time pay.
good,I feel the pickers at Amazon should get paod more than 13.00 due to they are walking 13 to 15 miles a day for 40 hrs a week. The management is fair in some departments but overall they need managers to do the work of the employees and maybe they will tell the upper management to get raises for the employees.
good,"Career progression is really bad. Office politics spread far and wide. Promotions are NOT meritocratic, but are based on the company's favourite leadership principle: 'Frugality'... Overall not a great place to be."
good,"Typical workday is scanning packages and building pallets. The pallets are wrapped by other employees when the spiders are not fast enough or overwhelmed. Obviously, some spiders are better than others. The employee morale is good besides the few bad apples. The people who gossip instead of working to complete their task in a timely manner. Also, I noticed a lot of animosity from jealous employees when dating someone they were rejected by in the past.Human resources should be more diligent when it comes to sexual harassment in the workplace as well.  Other than that, easy job but it should be a secondary job at best. Low pay, not enough hours and very little room for advancement."
good,It was a fast pace working place. But I like it because I can move around a lot and that can be a good workout for me for the day. They are very strict about sitting on the table that you are using to pack the items. There is not sitting down even if there is nothing to pack. You have to find something to pack or look around in your station to see if you need any more box or material for your station.
good,Very easy job and provides a consistent 40 hours. The work is easy but is also very boring. Getting a promotion also takes a while. Also the hours are long.
good,Typical work day includes doing the same stuff day in and day out to meet customer demands. It can get very hot in them summer time which makes the environment a little hard to work in. They do provide water.
good,A typical day at work was fast-paced. Most of the associates were easy to get along with. I enjoyed being a Tour Ambassador and member of the Fun Committee!
good,great job management takes there job very serious and helps let everyone up for success. thy created fun ways to make our everyday experience worth coming back.
good,"Satisfactory. Hr is there for the company therefore don't give them a reason to fire you by squandering your allotted time bank."
good,"Amazon should try to pay more attention to what employees are saying in regards to management, assignments and job culture, also- better paying salaries based off experience and individual job performance."
good,"It was a day that started out with job assignments and meeting, 10 minutes max."
good,learned to operate forklift very stressful at times break very far from certain departments took half your break to get there to many lazy people work there
good,Amazon isn't loyal to its hourly employees. Several people who worked several years of building up the warehouse in Hebron Ky was given the option of being bought out at $5000 and losing their beneifits or dropping to part time and keeping their benefits. Many people were devastated.
good,working here was like going to the gym basically every day you go you are assigned a spot to work an from the you sort the boxes into the places they were supposed to go
good,A typical day at ONT2 is spent walking miles of warehouse stowing objects (for the stower) and is very active. You need to have endurance and able to work the crazy 10 hour schedule. It's best if you are in the area but if you have to commute it makes it harder.
good,Just make sure you have some comfortable shoes  there is a lot of walking and you must keep your score at 80 percent. In order to be successful and be productive .
good,"Typical day at work is you're on your feet and moving all day.  I learned to be very fast at everything given to me.  Management is bleh, they play favorites.  Hardest part of the job: relying on others when your rate is affected by them, moving the entire time, using the bathroom.  The most enjoyable part is the breaks and lunch."
good,developers are too proud of their work to step back and receive criticism. senior management is not in sync with its employees. middle management is awesome though. always has your back.
good,I enjoyed working at Amazon. Great working colleagues. I didn't like the time tracking this was poorly done. One day I decided I was going to work hard and then the next day said I was idle for an hour and thirteen minutes. This was poor tracking of time as I know that I did the best I could so was not idle as Idle means your not doing any work. Their method of tracking time is very poor. I enjoyed working at amazon and their are great opportunitys to advance and training.
good,Supervisors change so much and can implement new ideas right away. Unfortunately some have no experience in warehouse. So you keep going back and forth.  Very computer focused and not looking at real world perspective.
good,"Work for 10-12 hours a day, and be prepared to work during weekends too."
good,"Každý den, je nový den"
good,"It was an ok place to work for. Did not stay there long. They had production and performance standards.  I think the performance was based on end of call surveys.  They did not provide much supervisory help.  You could only transfer to a supervisor if the customer asks for a supervisor, not if you needed help."
good,When i first started working here it was not a bad place for someone like me who just graduated to work at but then there was always favoritism at work you could tell and i guess the longer you work there the more leeway you can have
good,no comment on amazon. i only worked for amazon for one month. I left due to my work schedule conflicted with my visitation schedule with my daughter. My work schedule was working 4 ten hour days  and it was Friday-Monday.
good,"Shifts are 4/10s. Employees are expected to make rate in their first three weeks after training. Not making rate results in a write-up. Three write-ups mean termination of employment. The work is grueling but the people are nice, that is if you ever see them. I went 3 shifts in a row without any human contact and that includes my manager."
good,no more raises after 3 years took advantage of career choice and I'm moving on very good company to work for if you like to work .climate controlled 70 degrees.4 day work week.
good,"Overall amazon is a great place to work for, no one is behind you all he time telling you what to do as long as you do your job right I enjoy working there the people are friendly the managers are easy to talk to and I could say it is a fun environment after all."
good,"Everyone in the office made the best of their work, and helped each other when need be, but we were left in the dark about our work and a lot of our responsibilities were passed by word of mouth."
good,"Good place to work with excellent benefit packages. Very diverse work culture, friendly and comfortable.  Very laborious work, but also great management support."
good,They say certain things that happen wont go against you but i learned alot about the comapany and they provide personal hours every paycheck including your vacation time
good,"Amazon in Harrisburg PA was good job with good pay and benefits, it was challenging but also had a laid back family oriented feel. I would work for Amazon again and I would also recommend this job to anyone I knew."
good,They required a high rate of production. A team culture. Excellent upper management. The work was fast-paced and that felt good. The product being sorted varied a lot in the amount of difficulty
good,"Productivity counts while scanning products only!!!.  No credit given while counting every item in the tote or while opening several boxes within a box in a box before you can get to the products to scan.  Time is wasted counting the previous shift-worker's products that was scanned into a tote that the previous warehouse fulfillment associate did not have time to count because his/her shift ended. Some items are as small as paper clips with over 1,000 pieces. It may take up to 20 to 30 minutes to count a 1,000 or more multiple products. As a result, this cuts into your productivity.  Everyone is not trained equally."
good,"10 hour shifts. Very physical work. Production driven environment."
good,"The management wasn't good but we were a new store so it took a while for everything to come around but the staff was great and the customers were awesome. Working in a bookstore was a lot more fun than I expected. We had a lot of interactive classes and story times which made the shift fun! Amazon customer service on the store level was difficult but it was rare there were problems that we couldn't accommodate. Again, at the time, management was brutal: mixing up shifts, not responsive, not great at sharing the work load per employee, and a lot of gossip and favoritism but the staff made it worth it. They put together a great team on the floor level."
good,"Performance based position, you must deliver packages once you accept them from pick list or call support and customer if package is to be returned or delivered."
good,"pays well, many work hours, but a lot of defects and fall under your name outside of your influence while working in the same areas as other departments."
good,"Third shift is often the shift a new employee is given which never worked for me personally, The Labor is redundant and fast paced, the hours are long. there is too much time alone with your thoughts."
good,"It is a very stressful atmosphere. They push their employees to the point of exhaustion. They push employees to put out the products either in receiving , stow or picking."
good,"The management is horrible.  They are constantly monitoring productivity... they'd rather you not socialize or commune with friends/co-workers, just work work work.  Constantly changing goals numbers, so you never know what your goal is. And if not met consistently, you're canned"
good,"fast paced job, needs to make sure you are willing to sacrifice time, and life to this company if you want to work and advance with AMAZON. make friends fast and with the right people."
good,"While Amazon is well known for providing exceptional delivery and speed , the warehouse environment is everything you've heard, Noisy, overstaffed and sometimes so cutthroat, you're waiting for a guillotine to roll out."
good,work to long  to many people telling you what to do. breaks not long bathroom not clean to many things  missing when picking keep moving you to other jobs when no work
good,"This place has amazing opportunities with their benefits, their benefits are great but they work you to death to even enjoy them."
good,trabajar las ocho horas a un ritmo contante                                                    aprender poco pues el trabajo que realzaba  ya lo realize en otras enpresas                                                                                                                      la direccion un poco descontrol pues no se enteraban ni los  encargados del trabajo que habia que hacer                                                        lo que mas me gusto del trabajo es que me encontre con muy buenos compañeros
good,If there wasn't a threat to losing your job because you are required to required to pack 240 items per hour or disciplinary action is taken a couple of warnings then termination
good,"Hardest part was at the beginning, being on your feet for 10 hrs a day, but after a few weeks you get used to it. Work day went by quickly."
good,If a person is not used to working in a fast pace environment it will be a struggle for some. If the person is used to a fast pace environment then it will be easy for them. Overall it's a good place to work if want to have a job that pays over  minimum wage.
good,In my position you just stay in your square and move products. If you work here be sure to keep up with your clock-in and clock-out times because they are strict about it.
good,"Overall, some of the management performed their jobs well. Dental and vision insurance was a plus for part time work. I would re-apply  to work for Amazon in the Information Technology (IT) area of the company."
good,"10 hour days "
good,"Its a great place to work. I love, management, employees, production is fine.  The work is not hard.  everything is done using Robotics. The only thing you have to get use to is the standing on your feet all them hours. After about a 3 weeks that went away.  However, the VTO (Voluntary Time Off).  Over the last month or so, have not been able to work full shift without getting sent home early due to lack of work."
good,Working as Amazon associate is physically demanding  job...could be on your feet 10 hours day. Very taxing on the body. Great benefits. Okay pay for general laborer.
good,Its a very fast paced environment and the management definitely needs improvement. The breaks are short but the benefits are great. It's also a lot of physical labor.
good,It was a temp job over the holidays. 
good,"C plus, I did not like the 12 hour shifts, the culture is pretty good, management was cool, working 12 hours is challenging. I enjoyed the people there. Dress code was laid back."
good,"Work 10 hours, 2 fifteen minute breaks, 3 - 4 hours between breaks, 30 minute lunch, standing the whole 10 hours except for breaks, website says weekly pay, but it is actually bi-weekly.  Scanning standards too high for me.  Only employed for 6 months."
good,"I would recommend Amazon to anyone who is looking for a job that pays ok but also doesn't require too much labor, other that lifting a few heavy boxes."
good,"its an okay job pays 95% of schooling after an year, your going to be on your feet all day and moving around and majority of the time the work is repetitive."
good,"The job was easy to perform, but ten hours was boring, even broken up between a 30 minute lunch and two 15 minute breaks. There was cross training for other sections of the werehouse and a possibility to train into non-rate based work as well. It was a good experience."
good,when I first started this job .i was a picker which was alright until they started with a  the stressful stuff like you have to pick 300 items or more an hour. Then I was moved into the counter role where I had to count over 700 items or more an hour.
good,"Amazon is a fun place to work with an abundance of growth opportunities available for anyone willing to work hard enough. "
good,Bonne équipe et bonne organisation mais horaires déroutantes
good,"Amazon is at the cutting edge of technology but could do better to re-engineer their work / life balance practices. They are trying to grow as fast as they can, so I understand that some of these issues won't be addressed in time, but they are over 500K employees now and they need to develop creative ways of managing human capital."
good,"Fast pace work environment.  worked 4 days a week. Learn about culture. good management. Really smart people, a lot of opportunity for growth, always encouraged to be innovative, think big, and create something new. Competitive salary and benefits with other major tech companies. 100% self motivating work environment"
good,"Amazon is a nice place to work if you like fast paced environment. Only backdrop they have is salary and lack of growth. On a typical day if nothing goes wrong Amazon Canada 250,000 Products."
good,"Get up go in sit till 7:30 then clock in and go to our stand up to talk about our numbers of the day and go out and pick all day go to our breaks and then work till the end of the day."
good,"Ok place to work, enongh days off the pay was good. Work three to four days. Enough breaks and enough time. Management is good the workers are nice. Pay was good"
good,it is a good place to work.it is a devirse place with lots of opportunities to advance. they give incentive  during the peak season to work more hours.
good,"At Amazon there are no tips.just work hard and get paid.At Amazon fulfillment you need to be very hard working and should be able to lift heavy items. And should be punctual and on time as that would count on your continuing work,if not you would be fired."
good,"The hours around the holidays can be stressful and understaffed. This is very fast paced environment, so the hours do go by quickly. The benefit packages are great."
good,Management was cool they tired to do a good job but employees didnt care. The unload side was the best side for me because i liked feeding employees instad of getting fed
good,The company has a very exciting vibe to it. Enough training provided and the facilitators are very patient. The building has a homely feel to it. The company staff is well taken care of.
good,"It is a very fast-paced when it's busy, but pretty slow when there are not many packages sent to our warehouse. The people are great and so is the environment. They play music which can be very repetitive. Everyone is very nice and funny."
good,"Job was good and had good benefits, but the workload was a little much and 10 hour days of doing the exact same thing over and over got pretty hellacious."
good,work is easy but really fast paced they have good management Great HR Associates and good security you barely have time left in the day for your personal life but you do have 3 days off
good,"I worked at Amazon for a year and a half. I dealt with a lot of people while i was there. Some just making some extra money, and some trying to make it a career. I saw so many people get broken by this job, the only reason a lot of people were staying at Amazon was because the pay/benefits."
good,"if youre not with the pace, youre not going to go far with this company. management will take advantage of employees by offering advancement but never fully coming through."
good,A typical day is you come to work ready to work.  Amazon is fast paced and in most departments have rates you must maintain.  You have two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch.  Amazon trains their employees in each department.  The hardest part of the job would be the long hours during Christmas time.  The most rewarding part of the job is knowing you are making someone very happy when they receive their packages on time.
good,My overall experience with Amazon was positive due to overall compensation package and the potential for growth. However some HR and Senior leaders do not keep their word or stand behind their management. For a married individual the work-life balance is terrible and really needs to be considered prior to signing your offer letter. The environment is very cut-throat and doesn't believe in standing behind their management at times. Associates are unable due to the overwhelming amount of overtime he or she may have to work. But it will teach you how to be a better manager and propel you into the next faze of your career.
good,nice place to work if you are coming out of college or high school there are ping tables basketball shooting game but no advancement unless you have college degree or military back round well that's my thoughts on the matter
good,The best part of the job was the pay scale for this area and there was the opportunity to make overtime. I had the opportunity to learn how well the company treats their employees.
good,too many people sleeping not getting work done and there was no team work it was every man for him self and too many arguments I liked it at the start
good,"short breaks and short lunches, we have to plan our break accordingly for a 15, 2 min while walking to break room and 2 min walking back to Stand Up. So there's only 10 min to really enjoy it"
good,"Long hours, low pay, depressing moral. Unable to transfer or move up. Work guidelines are strict with little room for advancement. This is the way it appears now."
good,"With work depending on deliveries and Customers you find that it is a very different experience even on the same section every day. changed just enough to stay interesting."
good,El trabajo no estaba mal pero no sabias si al dia siguiente te iban a echar o no
good,Not a bad job management just has to learn to listen to employees more. Management should get on one accord when it comes to working front half and back half as “rules” go with VTO. The benefits are wonderful some of the best I’ve received
good,"a quiet place people are ok I had to learn from many and I managed to build a relationship of respect and trust"
good,Is a hard job. In busy time we had every day around 150 stops this is around 200 parcels and we need to delivery all the parcels without the concession this is very hard to do when you had a lot of costumers.
good,"The workplace culture and your coworkers are what kept you around. You have to be a strong person, willing to continue education and know how to not take things to personal. Its a harsh environment not not many can handle. Prepare to work every holiday, overtime and not to expect the company to work with you on flex-scheduling."
good,the co workers were nice and very helpful on how to maintain at the job. I learned a great deal about work ethic and longvity in the blue collar force
good,"The work is very physical and you are on your feet for 10 hours. Communication is poor so you need to be resourceful to stay informed. Schedule is the best part, 4 day work weeks with the exception of December. Two 30 minute breaks and that is it. Not allowed to have your cell phone with you so you are disconnected until your shift ends. It is very competitive and intense."
good,"Depending on which department you're hired onto its simply do your job. The leadership principles that Amazon follows are not only guidelines for the work area, but life outside of Amazon as well. Management supposedly displays leadership principles on all associates, or they hide behind a computer all day while there process assistants handle the workload for them. It was a 50/50 on management. I was lucky to have managers who cared for associates development and fought for there associates to the very end. The most difficult part of the job was leading associates who weren't motivated to work. It was enjoyable to find out what motivated individuals to work and meet the deadline that was given each day."
good,Working at amazon.com was a good and fast-paced job that i worked in and i enjoyed. The job might not work for everyone because it requires real hard work.
good,huge warehouses with loads of people working together. quality types of equipment and busy on each floor with different activities all around. the hard part is in the middle of the night for a night shift.
good,The job was a good chance for me to learn a new set of skill for any future jobsI enjoyed my job role as a packer and I would lover the chance to do a jobs like this again.
good,An amazing company to work with as it supports its employees in every aspect right from providing recreational activities to the flexible working environment.
good,"Too many people are always worried about what other people are doing instead of themselves. Working long hours could get really stressful you don't have a life outside of Amazon. I was there for a while, and on the weekend shift, so the pay was decent. The top out is $14.40 for the night shift so if you plan on making more money you have to move up or move out."
good,Amazon it what you make it they have good benefits and pay time off including upt Vto and paid time plus vacation time just do your work and be positive and you’ll be fine
good,"Its a great place to work day to day."
good,"Amazon is great place to work depending on what type of job you want. It's a very fast-paced, structured environment where we like to have fun. The workplace culture has improved over the years, but the hardest part is trying to get AA's involved. The pay is good & the benefits start on Day 1. As long as you want a job, you'll keep a job with Amazon. You start with 10 hrs of paid time & 10 hrs of vacation time. PTO is given every paycheck until you max out at 48 hrs per year, vacation time will accrue every pay check yearly, and you receive 20 hrs of unpaid time every 4 months."
good,Amazon was a great experience. It taught me how to work hard and how to succeed in a competitive environment. I developed a great relationship with my team and continue to communicate with them.
good,"On a typical work day, I would clock in and get work like any other work day. I learned that the work at Amazon is somewhat challenging. The management is very great. They keep you updated on your progress at work. The hardest part of the job is staying cool. It can get pretty hot inside especially during the summertime. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the people that work there. The people that work there are very polite and helpful."
good,"This is a fast pace place that can be competitive at times. Amazon is big on productivity, so it is a must you are meeting the requirements! Management is helpful when it comes to providing feedback."
good,"I worked night shifts at amazon. A first I could handle the hours, but once you get use to doing the same task repeatedly, you being to feel drained. The pay is great, but the hours are over kill."
good,"I worked there for only 6 months, it is extremely fast paced. If you you can't move as fast as they want, they won't hesitate you get rid of you. They do pay well and the benefits are great!"
good,"It's a good place to work and meet good people,, great job uncle jeff... Wish I could have stayed but I had to relocate out west my wife got a better job offer so we had to relocate.."
good,"very slow"
good,The job is great for someone who is willing to spend 10 hours plus standing on their feet. The location is huge and after your shift you will hurt until you're used to it.
good,it was really hard at amazon at first but once I got used to it it became a great place to work at. but you always have to work comfortably because this one job keep you busy and that's why I liked I preferred to stay busy.
good,"At Amazon you are guaranteed that you will not just walk, but power walk throughout the facility for 10 to twelve hours straight. You learn how to incorporate speed, precision and quality into your day. The culture of the workforce is very diverse as amazon hires just about anybody. The hardest part of the job is adjusting to the physical demand of the job, you never feel like you're moving fast enough. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the people you meet along the way and knowing that you are all in this together."
good,"La empresa esta implicada en sus trabajadores y busca siempre que estén contentos, por lo que exigen siempre el máximo de ellos."
good,"work there if you want stability, it is not easy work. if you are looking for easy work this is not a job for you, they pay decent but will over work you"
good,"I don't have a problem working for Amazon. The job itself is very easy! But 12 hours on your feet all day kills you! If I could switch to stow and and work 12 hours that would work, because I walk around all day, while they sit around. I would work Pick for 10 hour shifts 4 days a week. If I could switch to my preference I wouldn't have 5 out of 6 points within a couple weeks."
good,"Amazon working culture is a start-up company within a company. Every meeting starts with 15-20min reading of a doc instead of presentation. If you love writing a doc, this is the place."
good,"Amazon Is a Great place to work, during the holidays it can be overwhelming with all of the boxes but the job is doable you are paid well and it’s easy to get and keep a job there."
good,The management at the plant in Columbia is so unprofessional. I would never recommend anyone to work here. You are just a number to them. The expectations of this job were reasonable but you were only commended on what you did wrong.
good,I like it but they don’t have enough work. Need better working hours. And it’s too hot in there too work. Need acs in the working areas because it gets too hot.
good,"The job isn't too hard if you have a good work ethic, but very fast paced and they expect you to meet hourly quotas picking or packing product. If you don't meet them, they will give you a different job or let you go. However, the quotas aren't too hard to meet if you really try. It's long hours (10-12) hour shifts on your feet the entire time. Your back will hurt, but after enough time, you get a bit used to it. Good pay, though, with mandatory overtime."
good,typical day at amazon. Come to work. meet with co-workers at start up. Quick pep talk then off to work from 7;30-9. constantly moving around. Learned to work in a face paced enviorment.
good,"Very long hours, short breaks, management is good very helpful but a lot of favoritism is done. promotion is difficult if u don't know anyone. overall good place to work if you do not have anywhere else to go,"
good,Great people.  Great benefits.  Poor compensation.  Sometimes very difficult work conditions (no central air/heat).  Lunch and breaks could be longer given the long distances from work stations to time clocks and restrooms.
good,"Enjoyable work environment, help offered, very serious about safety. The one thing that I disagreed with was I had only worked two days (training was not fully completed) and one of this shift managers came to the work station and talked to be about writing me up for a mistake was made. I felt he could have pulled me off the floor to discuss the mistake."
good,"Great place to move fast and get things done.  Unfortunately, it may come at the cost of how people are treated.  Meetings can often become a exercise of ""gotcha"" and has been known to leave some people in tears."
good,"Amazon has good pay, nice clean working environment. Worst part about the job is the pressure that is put on management. There schedules are constantly being changed. Average manager is there less than 2 years. Most managers are stressed and that tickles down to the team members. I learned a ton there and all in all I enjoyed my job."
good,Jobs at Amazon require an employee who is seeking advancement.  An individual who is competitive and ambitious about there career would thrive here.  There did not seem to be room for an employee who wanted to stay in the current role and job description they are in.  Processes and expectations are constantly changing and becoming more demanding.
good,"productive, fun and fast paced workplace"
good,"It's a great place to work if you have a good manager and a process assistant that cares about your rate and your general productivity. Benefits are good. They offer overtime which is great. There's a lot of things that happen at times some PA favors their friend's by allocating some stations to their friends and giving out good carts with small items in order to help them maintain their rates always, not considering other associates. Beware of bad managers and horrible teammates. They are not specific to Amazon but they do exist in Amazon. But it was fun working at Amazon with some good teammate that want you to succeed."
good,"The days are long, the quota is really high even during training, the storage process is awful. the pay is good, the chances for bonuses is highly dependant on performance between both day and night shift."
good,"if you like walking 15-20 miles a day this place is for you."
good,"good job, excellent benefits. a lot of opportunities and good environment to work. a lot of working hours and a good based salary. it's a very good job to start with something."
good,"you clock in ,and you start organizing carts ranging from 25 to 75 and then you take 15 minute break . Next you start scanning and labeling packages according to route"
good,"There ain't much to said because I only work as temp and worked there four to six months. The work they put me is receiver and water spider. Receiver I had to open package and make sure that the system tell that Amazon had receive the package and we will stored to carts, and the water spider will push the cart to stocker whom put in different cart as the stuffs are available. I learned to be fast and accurate at same time. The management was alright for it size because they were too many workers to deal with. The hardest part is to do same thing over for ten hours. It was fine in first two month but over time it did get little bored. The most enjoyable part was open package it felt like Christmas every days. Open every boxes and see new toys and stuffs make me feel like a kid again."
good,"anybody that gets hired as a temp or seasonal worker at Amazon and wants to get a full time contract with benefits all you need to do is work hard. Be positive, if there's any down time look active, clean your station even ask a supervisor if there's anything that needs done.  it's not rocket science. If you're a hard worker and want to contribute something to the team. 99% sure you will get kept on."
good,"Amazon has great benefits, the only downside are the long hours and bad management. Their HR team sucks and does not care for the employee. If you are doing what you are supposed to do you will be ok."
good,"Well, It's management decision avoid employees who want that job, but new employees come in and took their jobs that they request. They were upset and quit."
good,"mon travail été d enregistrer chaque articles au scan , avant de les placer dans les entrepôts ."
good,"I learn to work with a lots differents peoples, good experiences, nice and good benefits on medical, we have free luch on thanksgiving and some free muffin too"
good,"Would be a very rewarding job if you weren't working 50-90 hours per week year round. All managers are understanding, knowledgeable, and helpful. Unfortunately the amount of work expected in this position just takes an unbelievable amount of work throughout the week, and it's not work you can complete at home."
good,"Fast pace, must be physically fit, long hours on feet, very diverse group of people. Alot of voluntary extra time.  Fast hire on, great bbenefits!!!!!"
good,"Fast paced work Environment "
good,"Its a fun place to work in, but over the time the work pressures pushes the fun level to miniscule. But considering the business growing and trends this is the company to work in especially in India"
good,I recommend working at Amazon if you really need money. But if you do work there your giving up most of your life. You'll only have 1 day off. Your lucky if you receive 2. There are benefits but there are also things Amazon can work on to make it better for the workers.
good,"Good pay, but hard to advance in this company. Alot of favoritism and the ones who actually worked were the ones who always seem to always have issues, but the ones who didn't work always got away with not working.."
good,"First of all I want to say that Amazon has great benefits and vacation and pto and upt. But while managers can seem nice and friendly....their main job is to motivate you to move product.There are set rates that are not only at times hard to obtain...sometimes impossible. While our warehouse was being renovated space was at a premium and many stowers had problems finding space especially if they were assigned to stow larger merchandise.Some stowers snuck off to stow in unassigned areas which could get you a write up.Stowers ,like all amazonians desperate to make rate had to resort to either stowing nonfifo(first in first out) items that they manage to snag when managers aren't paying attention or just short cut by putting merchandise where they weren't suppose to. You can go months without a single write up and then get too many bad stow paths in a row and then be terminated for circumstances out of your control. I saw many hard workers lose their jobs. With their temporary workforce in place there is always someone there to replace you.It's a stacktype system....and it doesn't matter why or what circumstances put you in the bottom ten percent. Don't get me wrong. Most of the time I liked working for Amazon but it is a company that can steal your soul if you let it.You will never feel so irreplacable.If people only knew the real truth behind the click."
good,"i have done job for three months but it was good to work and there is a nive growth  in this field but the timing is very large, and the work was very hard"
good,"Good company to work for, some challenges, fast pace. The management was good. Good opportunities to train in other departments. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with."
good,It depends on which Department that you end up in. STO is a nightmare of deadlines and thankless work. High quotas and if those are not meant you can easily get written up. However the benefits are awesome and you can meet some great people there.
good,The company is ever changing and communication is low. Most of the work is put on the PA's and management hides in the break room. The job is good to build management and interaction skills but at the end of the day you are rushing to leave.
good,"I enjoy the work.  I deliver packages and can work when I want. Everyone I meet is nice and I haven't met a customer I didn't like.  Unless there are people around you who are nice enough to tell you some of the ropes most of the work is trial and error. For example, I had no idea they had bags for my restaurant deliveries I had to get told by a pizza restaurant who wouldn't let me leave with my little hot cold bag I bought on my own.  Also, I wish the company took our feedback more seriously."
good,Is good if you like warehouse work and are always looking to stay up on your feet.. Pay could be better but while i was there I liked it. Slow advancements in the workplace
good,work at amazon is straight forward you're trained to do a task and to work at the expected production numbers. i learnt many things in regards to warehouse they try and highly value associates.
good,Amazon is an average place to work.  They work you extremely hard for the small amount that they pay.  It is an awesome job for those folks who are just looking for some work and not necessarily a career.
good,"Amazon would be a great fit for someone who is looking to do alot of walking,stooping,climbing and enjoys a fast-paced environment. I liked  seeing all the products they shipped."
good,Working at Amazon was a great learning experience! They give you the opportunity to advance yourself and make it fair for everyone to move up in the company. Sometimes it is hard to get to know management when working in such a large warehouse but in the same breath when you do meet them its always satifactory.
good,"Work Environment is great. You can listen to music, you can wear anything you like. You get paid for every additional hour you work. You get a bonus whenever performed to the mark. You get opportunities to earn Gift Cards every month and awards for your performance. Your issues are addressed. You get a laptop which is yours till you leave the company."
good,"Gives you no warnings, automatic termination. When there is no work they want to just sit there but will turn around and fire you for not doing anything."
good,"The management is the reason why the warehouse I'm currently working at is falling apart. They do not hold anyone accountable for their actions, but then get mad when the employees begin to get lazy and sloppy."
good,FOUR TEN HOUR DAYS WITH THREE DAY OFF IN A ROW. Mandatory overtime. 12.50 hr. The holidays are can be rough. Temperature controlled. Can't keep your phone on you but they do provide an emergency number. Good point system. Non union.
good,"40+ hours a week with mandatory over time, I've had the worst luck imaginable working there. It honestly was not for me. The break rooms are nice, so are the people, but I kept messing up and they issued me three trainers to try to correct my mistakes and they said that im doing nothing wrong. They say climate controlled environment, still super hot. Oh well, on a lighter note, some of my friends that work there really like it. It's warehouse work. It's a good paying job, but I've had a few people on my shift get hurt and one left on a stretcher in the first few days of working there and they didn't come back. It's not for everyone. My word of advice, Be safe around the warehouse."
good,a typical day at work i would be at my station putting items away that people have ordered after awhile i would get bored because the job is boring. the job is made for people who are good with patients
good,"If you go in through an agency be prepared for headaches, especially if you are not an integrity temp! The managers and HR give you so many run  around answers that aren't helpful. Attendance is everything. They have no problem firing you if you don't want to be there in turn to complain about being short staff and not reaching deadlines. A lot of young people get in and take the job lightly as well so expect a turn over rate from your starting group of associates"
good,"- depending on your job title and area working as an amazon associate is pretty simple. Its a fast paced environment, must meet the demands of quota to ensure job security. very competitive among peers. Managment is ok but could be better. Hardest part of the job is when you are assigned to do a task and is left there alone with no help due to the fast pace environment. Most enjoyable part of the job is working with people who are culturally diverse and upbeat nature that helps the time seep away at work."
good,"It started off good (because of the pay), however the long hours and job duties are very offsetting. The job is very mind numbing and painful to your feet especially."
good,"Not a company you want to move up  "
good,Amazon was ok but its very fast paced and you have to reach a certain pick goal everyday which was sometimes hard to do overall it was a good job very fast paced
good,"Typical work day is routine. I have learned how to problem solve in two departments, Pick and Vendor returns. I've also had the opportunity to be in the Learning department and learn how to board and train new employees."
good,Typical day at work involves everything from picking orders to shipping orders and crediting customers for any return goods services.  All while being monitored for very fast paced productivity numbers. Could also involve unloading and reloading trucks depending on work needs as per employee numbers status. Stocking shelves with products and performing inventory duties to insure products are always available for customers per order requirements.
good,Working at is face paced and can be hectic. Making rate is not bad and they so supply us with lunch sometimes. The best thing I enjoy working at Amazon is power hour. You can win different things by performing the fastest.
good,"Workplace that makes you more active"
good,"Busy work place, many people from different backgrounds. the hardest part is long hours and short breaks.Picking is really challenging and interesting."
good,"Its a great place to work if you have a strong work ethic and have a flexible schedule. Its a bi-weekly pay plus benefits are available to you on day one. "
good,"Evolution de carrière rapide pour ceux qui en veulent vraiment.  "
good,"Bright people. Work is fast paced and very demanding. "
good,"typical day at work shift would start they would tell us the total volume we had for the day and how much our shift would do while we stretched, then most people grabbed scanners or rap poles, some went to inbound or outbound and divert, about 2 hours in is a 15 min. break then back to work, the management seemed to either always give out bad info or never got the right info."
good,Alot of favoritism and unfairness to many people but besides that there is a variety of people of all ages from many different cultures which makes it interesting
good,"The work is 10 hours a day, four days a week. I enjoyed the work overall, but they tend to hire in mass. This means that lots of new people who don't know what they're doing are trying to work together, which makes for an unproductive work environment. I also didn't feel my training was entirely sufficient, as trying to meet the daily goals was a challenge consistently."
good,"The idea of the culture is good, however their is a lot of work to be done within a short amount of time. It is a demanding job. They do on occasion make work fun and offer small incentives when you reach your productivity goals."
good,"I would help load trucks & build ""walls"" in the trucks so packages can be sent out. Load packages on conveyer belts, use pallets and jacks to move packages to different areas of the ship dock. the hardest part of this job was the demand and overtime. 11 hour shifts, 5 days a week. I didn't see my son too often or spend the time with him that I was used to. the most enjoyable part of the job was the pay. we were greatly compensated."
good,"The temp agency allows you to work and certain amount of hours until you get hired on fulltime which is amazing, the atmosphere is alright, the people are great to work with"
good,If it was music the work Woulf flow way faster and get done faster. Need to be more organized but overall ya good job to make some extra cash if you need a part time job
good,the job has always been fast paced and challanging i enjoyed my time working for them. i learnt many skills at work as well as first aid as well as skill applyed in areas all over the workplace
good,Amazing Projects hindered by slow top management decision making. Over reliance on data - paralysis by over analysis. Very few big picture projects and more day to day fire fighting.
good,"Amazon has many good qualities of work but also has his cons.this company give the opportunity of success learn new skills. However, they don't give the opportunity of choose our schedule and time as a family workers."
good,Working in Amazon was a good experience for me. Shift schedule was very flexible. Every day we did exercise to get energy for starting our job at the Amazon company.
good,"Amazon is a great place to work for if you are are a workaholic. They offer great benefits but often the support staff (Human Resources) is given more than 8 hours of work on a consistent basis.  Work is given without any strategic regard to getting projects completed and often requires associates to have personal information in order to obtain the help needed by using personal cell phones for company business, etc."
good,"Did a lot of training. Help on lines, production, coaching others."
good,I was not able to work full time. The only way I could work a full 8 hours is if I was to switch building. And it was nearly impossible to switch buildings when I barely started.
good,"There are many, many, many roles. I enjoy the problem solving and assistant roles you get into when you start to show core competency in the basic roles. Now im an ambassador which is amazon's fancy way to say peer trainer. There are ACTUAL training roles but they are mostly our bosses as ambassadors. "
good,"They were making strategic changes in the company that will be very good for them but made my job much less interesting and challenging, so it was the perfect time for me to make a change."
good,"It's a job. hrs range from 3-5 hrs a day depending on how busy it is. The worst about this job is the short breaks no matter how long the day is you just get 12 minutes. And not many benefits with this position, so if you get hurt thats it don't expect to get paid for it, please buy your own insurance from Aflac."
good,just nonstop package sorting and scanning packages to a pallet  the people was good to work with but the pay wasn't that good and the hours wasn't good either
good,The pay was nice if you have dependents but if you are just working for your self then the pay is not worth the mental strain it gives you. I would not recommend this to younger people.
good,"excellent benefits"
good,"Decent pay, management can be a little disrespectful at times but the experience was bearable. Crazy CPT schedule can be a little rough, but challenging and fun at the same time."
good,"Though they do have good benefits and plenty of work to do for their employees, they seem to use loop holes to terminate employees after so long of working. A work in progress Ill say. Should have come along very well since Ive been there."
good,10 hour days be prepare to work overtime. kinda takes away from home life. Have to work overtime to get an ok check. ( $10 and hour). you will be on your feet all day.
good,Being able to work from home and choosing your hours is a HUGE plus! However the training is just ok. Taking calls was hard because you are kinda thrown in quickly. I think you need to have thick skin because some customers can be very disrespectful over the phone. Trying to search for the customers needs or concerns all while being on a timer is hard starting out.
good,I like the job because it keeps you busy all day. I learned that its really takes a dedicated person to work for amazon. I really loved the  way they had there management setup there its quit well put together
good,They have recently have been using threatening ways to up productively to unreal numbers. Most people have been feeling a dread just going to work each day.
good,"This job truly depends on you as a person. If you're fast paced, kind of careless and just there for a pay check it may work for you. If you're a slower worker and care about your quality of work then you may want to try another job. They're BIG on ratings and they don't play about them. The pay is decent as a temp, not sure what the pay is once you convert over to a permanent postion. However I heard the benefits are great. It's all in what you make it truthfully. "
good,"The job requires a lot of walking with short breaks. Must be willing to work every day with a positive attitude. The work environment is demanding and stressful, great benefits but pay is not enough for job duties."
good,"Good job with good benefits.  Fast pace physical jobs.  Management rates from great to poor.  Have several career choice opportunities, working with good people,"
good,"The fast paced work flow in the Amazon world can and will chew you up and spit you out if you let it.  Its a highly competitive environment.  Get the experience you need and move up or move on.  Your experience may be different depending on the management in charge at the time of your tenor, but don't expect it to stay that way.  As a floor associate I had 8 different managers I reported to in my time on the floor.  When I moved to maintenance I had 4 in the two years in that department.  Change is good but to much change can be bad.  Especially if communication is not something the teams are good at.  At Amazon there is always multiple projects going on at the same time and teams stepping on another teams project is a common occurrence in the pursuit of process improvement.  It was said multiple times during my employment with Amazon that it was not a company to retire from.  Rather it was a company to build your experience and move up or move on.  I could go on and on.  Bottom line, it looks good on your resume, but don't expect to stay long."
good,"When I began working at Amazon, it was the best place to work at. However, as years passed, the management changed, all the old managers quit and the new management changed everything. This changed Amazon's work culture. They drive the employees only with money with no regard for time or one's personal choice."
good,"The manager I currently work under has been the worst supervisor I have had in my long career. His attitude has ruined the culture at my specific location, and it is nothing close to the culture that was presented during orientation. I have not had a one on one conversation with him to learn his expectations or how I am performing at the location.  He may be intelligent; however, he is far from a leader (he's a manager). I believe Amazon's refusal to reassign this manager to a different role will allow this location to crumble and high junior management turnover. "
good,Amazon was good working place clean environment friendly people and a stress-free place to enjoy work I had a very great experience learning new jobs at amazon
good,"Excellent place to start your career as a fresher. good work life balance. A place where you'll enjoy working. Do whatever you want to, but complete the work. That is AMAZON!!"
good,This was one of most difficult jobs that I ever worked at. I worked 10 hours shift and we had to walk about twelve to fifteen miles a day. It is definitely a hard job to work at.
good,Working at amazon was cool. If your thinking about a career here just know that you have to be able to work fast and be as accurate as possible. It's a very fast-paced and competitive work environment.
good,"Amazon is a good job for HS school students just graduating.Unless you're going straight into management,this company requires too much for little pay"
good,Un travail physique dont il faut un mental bien cadré. Les horaires 2x8 est un engagement de flexibiliter d'horaire totalement decaler.
good,"Well give you instructions and train with no pressure. The pay and hours are decent. the management is decent, the work culture is variety of for everyone big diversity place. Pick/ Pack you gotta be fast when making a box and shipping products. Sometimes the atmosphere the people they weren't so stuck up and soulless."
good,"Promotions are few and far between as well as too subjective. Very 'clicky' groups. Pay scale and raises poor and too broad. But as far as steady work and great benefits, it serves the purpose."
good,"scan a item and verify description and quantities against database. Management style is micro, numbers driven, culture is for you to become a robot. 10 hour shifts can be difficult at times"
good,"Amazon Fulfillment is a decent company to work for. The hours are long and the work is exhausting. The only true upside to working there is the compensation and everyday workouts. The management is decent, sometimes a little biased with advancement in the work place but decent."
good,Amazon is a demanding employer but it's a fun place to work. You will learn a lot of life lessons here and the biggest one is keep moving forward. There is no place for anyone who cannot pull their own weight.
good,"Some people do a lot of work and work hard, and some people find ways to get around work and let others pull their part of the work. Like most businesses."
good,"Amazon gives you paid time, vacation time, and unpaid time. 4 paid holidays and you can take a leave of absence if need be. They offer to work around your school schedule and offer to pay for schooling after a year of employment. You get a schedule of 4 days on and 3 days off. 10 hours a day and opportunity for overtime. It's very fast paced and hot and sweaty work. The management is okay sometimes and horrible most of the time. You have to meet your quota or be fired. Just a number in the corporation, no real appreciation or respect. But your coworkers usually are great and you meet new ones every week! But a lot of them quit because of the low morale and long days. 10 hours on your feet take a big toll."
good,"This is a great company with comp and benefits. Work life balance is placed on the backburner though. Also, internal promotions get do not get treated fairly."
good,"I worked there for peak but there was a lot of VTO."
good,Amazon is a great company to work for. They definitely give proper compensation and benefits and plenty of opportunity to advance. The hours are very long and can be grueling. The job requires a level of dedication that can remove all aspects of your personal life forcing you to be devoted to the job.
good,"Indy5 was the warehouse i worked. was in plainfield, in. ok place to work. hours could get crazy. you are on 4 ten hour days. and if overtime is called you have to work. pay is decent"
good,"My relief were my breaks, just to rest for a while before going back to work. The break rooms are impressive. "
good,"Picking items bringing them to the destination that the Iteam needs to be sent to , walking around the warehouse , helping out employees hat need help"
good,"It is the most competitive brick-and-mortar chain to ensure customers are top priority, but faces many challenges to keep the moral in tact. Amazon has changed the online industry changes from the rise of online shopping. Amazon.com has eaten away at sales of almost every traditional retailer."
good,"Great benefits, decent pay but with a cap, too much favortism to be able to move up, managers are in and out just as much as regular associates.  It's always odd when I know more about the building and everything in it compared to a new manager off the street."
good,At Amazon you can bring your dog and eat excellent culinary delights while sitting at whatever desk you would like.  They add on duties as you become familiar but its kind of stressful.
good,Good culture of continuous improvement and innovation. Hard to attain a good work life balance but can move through projects and assignments quickly gaining a lot of great experience.
good,one of the best warehouse jobs out there. they have many employees coming in constantly so if you mess up they will have no problem firing you. other than that you are well taken care of.
good,"Amazon prides itself on being a fun environment, but that quickly changes when they are forcing to make a rate everyday and if you don't they write you up. It's an easy job, but you are on your feet for the entirety of your shift expected to work at full speed and meet goal. It wears you down after so long. The benefits and pay are nice, but I wouldn't say it's worth it if you have a more relaxed job with a work environment that isn't so face paced. Since the buildings are so large, advancement within the company is competitive and very hard unless you've put a lot of time into it. Even if you have the potential, requirements, and desired work ethic they find a fault to make you work more."
good,"I like working there, but there are many LAZY employees, and the leaders either ignore, or accept it.  To much chatter withe the foreign workers. And the rules are either overlooked, or not attended to.  Good employees are not rightly appreciated"
good,"Atmosphere is fast paced and you have room to advance in the company. The work can be to much at times, but the pay for overtime is well worth it. Check it out"
good,"Minus the Somewhat Odd Decision Making, For the Most Part Amazon is a Good Place to Work. The Only Downside to This Company is the Dreaded ""Library"" Which is Infamous for Being a  Job Death Sentence. I was Lucky and  Dodged that Bullet. If You Want Good Training Here, You'll Have To Beg for It."
good,"great benefits but stressful work environment"
good,Very hard work with long hours. Great work ethics from management. Hardest part of job is the long hours of constant going with high numbers to reach.
good,"Difficult to balance work life and personal life"
good,"Its a fine job its just exhausting. Benefits are excellent, paid personal time and vacation time accrues bi-weekly.  Having 3 days off a week is nice.  Some work practices are annoying.  They raise the rate during off peak months so that new people can't keep up and are then terminated.  Turn over rate is 95% in the first 3 weeks.  I wouldn't work here unless you're in dire need of money or health insurance.  Met some great people but after my 7th week there I couldn't physically do it anymore."
good,"There are Pros and Cons to every department.  I enjoyed Stow, it was really easy, but it could get boring.  The pay is good and their benefits are good."
good,"long start up hours to get the floor running. i learned how to organize my workplace. management wasn't the best, the workplace culture was very diverse, the hardest part of the job was the long start up hours. the most enjoyable part was the pay."
good,"to many turnovers"
good,"une expérience forte, le travail de l'usine mais en était polyvalent la variation des différent poste et plus agréable"
good,"It's a good job to make money. Though, the long, tedious hours of doing the same thing with little breaks gets to you. You need to have a strong mind to work there."
good,"Managers are all polish and just think about their polish people, you are ignorred if from somewhere else. The work is not hard but very boring, if you will work night shifts as i did it will damage your health and sleep."
good,This was a good job until i got hurt on the job and then i was treated completely different and it was very difficult to work here after that. Almost like they held it against me for getting hurt
good,This job Is all about safety which is what I like about this company but either than that this job requires a lot of energy and dedication. room for advancement but extreme effforts need to be given
good,Good experience working with all levels of management. Going out in the field and trying out new ideas. Bias for action is very big and hence one must go out and try his/her ideas.
good,"A typical day of work, is to clock in, go to stand up, figure out what station they have you at for the day. The hardest part of the job is the repetiveness it can make you very sleepy,also having to stay at a consistant speed while working, can really put a strain on your muscles."
good,The Team AWS I was on was a fend for yourself team. There wasn't a lot of collaboration and team connection. The volume was so high that providing exceptional candidate experience became lost. I felt as though I was on a conveyer belt - however I do believe it depends on the team you're on.
good,"A typical work day at amazon is usually fast past."
good,"C'est une bonne entreprise, je travaillais en 2/8, les horaires sont plutôt bien par rapport à certaines entreprises. "
good,Amazon is a good place for benefits but the management is terrible just a bunch of college kids that have no experience in warehouse and have their favorites
good,"Learned a lot... This company taught me how I can be multi-tasking."
good,A great place to set a career for yourself. Must be able to blend very easily into the work culture. Bar raisers are assigned to each individuals to ensure expectations are met.
good,Management was horrible. I was working for scoobeez courier service through amazon and there was no communication as to how we would perform. Most jobs write you up if your performance isnt on point but here they just fire you without notice which is what happened to me. No warning they just took me off the schedule and paid me. I was one if their best drivers doing circles around people that were there 1+ years. The job wasnt hard but they really need to work on their communication.
good,"Fun to work there,but had issues with management and the processes that are not in place.Great benefits package and pay is good."
good,"Personally I love the easy work. You could never call it hard but the hours get to some people when they found out how long you really standup other than that it was basically easy work and money"
good,"Can be a demanding work environment depending on the department, but there are lots of opportunities for learning. They are also really great about internal transfers which can be helpful when you want a change."
good,"As a picker I had to walk several miles a day but I did not mind it. Managers are very nice people and I dont find those horror stories you can read online apt, the job is not so bad, really."
good,"It's great if you absolutely hate leaving the house and enjoy working from home. I wouldn't recommend to college students. Unless you work part-time, they aren't very flexible about scheduling."
good,"Good company with lots of benefits as private healthcare  insurance, help with the future studies in your chosen specialization, good salary. Fun workplace, good experience"
good,I loved amazon when I first started working there I loved getting up and going to work and pick up extra shilfs that was my favorite to do. I was the for a year and our manger were leave one by one and we ended up with new mangers that would not listen to one other they argue right in front of employees all the time
good,"Working at Amazon is nice in the beginning, they do take work very seriously. They have fun stuff in the break rooms like games and alot of food. Overall working was a seven."
good,Worked here for 6 months as a financial analyst intern.  There were desks and cubicles.  Thats about it.  I learned some SQL.
good,Lots of labor ...10hr shifts ....30 minute lunch .....   paid holidays great benefits there is also alot of fun people that work there. We also had raffles throughout the month of December
good,Overall good job to have. Been with Amazon for three years it was just time for to spread my wings. Great benefits people that I met due out my time with Amazon was amazing.
good,Its okay you don't get that much hours after peak you make at least 100 a week that's all . management is rude and don't know how to talk to people. amazon is the reason I'm going broke need a second job
good,Amazon was a great place to work.It builds you up as a person.The leadership team is helpful.Amazon is a place that pushes you to your goals
good,Great place to work especially for people starting there first job in life. If you can handle high stress and fast paced enviroment you will like the job. Most people complain of aching feet and some positions require alot of walking. During holiday seasons expect to to 12 hour shifts.
good,"I wanted help build the company and enjoy life there. Its very comfortable there I like it."
good,"The supervisors are overbearing but the benefits are great. Benefits, pto, and upt available as soon as you start. If the standing in the fulfillment centers wasn't so extreme it wouldn't be such a bad place to work."
good,A typical day at work is counting bins and waiting for lunch. I learned how to use scanners. Management is really bad doesn't really help a whole lot. Co workers are cool and can makes friends with anybody. Hardest part of the day is keeping busy. The most enjoyable is lunch.
good,C'est un milieu où on voit beaucoup de gens donc liens sociaux renforcés
good,Not to bad of a job. I learnt many things there. I learnt how to make a box😂 I had the chance to see many items that Amazon sold. I learnt how to work around different positions in the factory.
good,The company overall was good but my building was terrible. We never hit our numbers so we were always on 12 hours for five days. Management didn't know what they were doing at all. MDW6 needs help.
good,"The primary quality I gained from working in Amazon is major discipline, in regards to ; safety, quality and productivity.  Also The social atmosphere was good for boosting morale"
good,"Most days are very busy, breaks are short due to walking distance to breakroom, Always competition between co workers. Easy packing though. Managers will send you to different departments ."
good,"Very, physcially demanding, PA need to be switch in each department as like the mangers are.So , the same people that the PA picks does not give oppurtunity to others as it should be Fair!!!!"
good,A great place to learn about the Logistics field. It has a wide variety of people working there sp you'll always meet new friends. The work is hard but bearable. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet the whole shift.
good,On your feet 12 hours per day picking and stocking heavy merchandise.  The only time you are allowed to sit is during your breaks which you are allowed 2 15-minute breaks and 1/2 hour lunch.
good,I start my day getting a cart of parts for customers checking them in and grouping and packing them getting them ready for shipment. I've learned time management working for this company.
good,On a typical day coming into stand up you find out your goal for the day and you try to reach it. My experience there made me very competitive and achieving goals were easy.  The hardest part was the long hours during peak season but the checks were the most enjoyable.
good,"When we start work, we usually first do the line up. after that we look on the board for our assignment for the day. We grab scanners if you are assigned to scan that day. after scanning about 14k packages, sometimes more we than are assign to teams so we can get the bags ready for the packages to be delivery."
good,Ho imparato  tante cose a ..certe volte diventavo pazzo che non trovavo îi pachi ma per il resto andava benisimo
good,Management is horrible they never have their stuff together. Ops managers run employees off with their nasty attitudes. The system has to many requirements when you get wrote up or warnings.
good,"I spent two months with Amazon as a full-time associate. Let me start by saying this: Amazon is a great company. They offer an exceptional benefits/compensation package for the type of work you will be doing, and the warehouse is air-conditioned. You also manage your own time off. You will not find an pleasant warehouse/packing company to work for anywhere."
good,"A typical day would start with stretches and lead into hours spent counting and assuring product quality and quantity within the warehouse. Perhaps not the most exiting job, but with a plethora of interesting coworkers and fun events the company puts together."
good,Open and close. Make food orders for patience and visitors. Get things ready for the next day. Worked every other weekend which I liked because I had a weekend to myself
good,"Working at Amazon is a hard going job but it pays well. Not a very good place to work if you do not drive though, buses can be a pain because there are limited buses to and from the Amazon warehouse."
good,"It is a good place to develop yourself further and realize your dream by following Amazon leadership culture. Though every day is erratic if you work in Amazon. Fast-paced, fierce competition make you push yourself every day."
good,"Amazon fulfillment center was always filled with surprises. Everyday going in was a new journey, although the job was stressful at times I learned how to deal with the pressure of deadlines. I learned things like using an RF scanner to locate the correct product inside the building."
good,"Overall it is not a bad place to work at. It is a very easy job to understand on how to do and not hard to do. As long as you do your job you will be fine. "
good,"The job was very demanding. You had to keep up a high rate which meant you had to keep up a very fast rate and not stop until told to do so. Breaks were very short and didnt allow you to rest and regain your energy back. They sent me home multiple times over ""serious medical issues"" that werent serious, They didnt care about their individual workers"
good,"Want fast money this is the place to go. Is fast paced and can be grueling, but if you enjoy keeping busy this is the place to go."
good,"Ok place to work, but very short on break times and extremely fast pace needed to work. Management say what they mean and mean what they say. Break times are very short, but management go and return from break the same time as you. A lot of the team leaders and a management have worked their way up from the shop floor."
good,You are surrounded by aot of new people so you make friends quickly. The coworkers are helpful and make sure you are included in all company activities
good,"I supplied my co workers with product for shipments or orders, and I also stocked the product. I enjoyed working in there, there was always there to help in any way they possible could if I had any problems or questions, the hardest part of the job was that they were not very flexable with the fact that most people had families and me being a single mom sometimes I had things to tend to with my daughter."
good,"You are on your feet for 10hrs,walking at a very fast paste to meet the need of the Amazon's manager's,and customer.you are required to meet a 100% production,which can sometimes be hard to do,due to the competition among your co-workers. the benefits are great,and you are allowed time off without any penalties from the company,provide that you have the time."
good,they are a stable company that is easy to move up in if you have the basic schooling requirements.  Lower level work varies from area to area and I recommend finding an area that suits you.
good,Company could be great if management was more skilled and actually have work experience themselves. There was to much favoritism in depts. All in all it was an okay place to work.
good,Amazon is a great place to gain some experience and start your career. Employers know the hours involved working at Amazon and having the name on your resume looks great. Amazon will take what you give it. There is a poor work life balance. You can expect a typical work week of ~50 hr (not including peak hours). The upper management are all experienced people within logistics. Hope your building team is good as mine!
good,"Upper management was out-of-touch and aloof, but the rest of the staff and experience were positive, I enjoyed working with the sales staff and procuring conventions for the city!"
good,Was always physically demanding and always on a time schedule difficult a lot of the time but equally ok when the staff and management are friendly and are always looking too help.
good,"Worked here for 2 years, advanced quickly. Now things are changing new management every month seems like. People were just unhappy. Pay was decent, holiday season was good money but a nightmare 60hrs shift during the holidays but easy money. Met some awesome people tho. Only a few managers care about the people and HR was a mess."
good,did not enjoy working in a factory it was always to hot and the hours were always to long but i meet some really nice people. i enjoyed meeting new people and the place was always clean
good,A typical day at Amazon is receiving inventory so it can be stored in warehouse. Fast past entire shift.  Enjoy people I work around.
good,"I personally don't wish to speak about my time at Amazon, namely due to the fact that it is responsible for a few nightmares from what we carried in that building."
good,i learned to do pick witch i didn't knew about until Amazon. the best part of working at Amazon was to know many people from different parts of the world. The hardest part was  that i had to travel long way to work.
good,"Good balance of work schedule with personal life.  Great benefits, i.e., insurance.  Good pay with potential for raises."
good,Begin by logging in and taking calls I learned how to deal with a vast number of customers on a day to day basis management was real down to earth I would say shared interest and was flamboyant co workers were also flamboyant but overall friendly hardest part of the job was irritate customers and most enjoyable was the nice customers
good,"A typical day at Amazon was sweaty, much like a rat race to meet rate requirements. I learned how to make use of a pick gun and become fast at identifying items from picking out key words on the gun. Management was friendly, yet firm. There was not much time in an average work day to get to know my co workers. Everyone is in a hurry and focused. The hardest part of the job was making rate with bad pick paths. A bad pick path is one where your pick gun sends you from one end of the pick mod to another or has you switching floors every few items. The most enjoyable part was pretty much any day with a good pick path."
good,"This job was a great experience for me to improve my interpersonal skills. Before working here i had been a bit more shy around people, but this job helped me to open up."
good,"job was chrismas temp, and was not very stable. but good buch of people. travel was ver convenient and would recomend to friends."
good,Interactive platform with different types of people and fun place to work with learning and giving productive results.
good,"great starting place"
good,"An exceptional place to work, Amazon includes a pool of talented individual who drive and share enthusiasm and inspiration to  co-workers. A highly energetic workplace."
good,I have learnt much in these years.Very flexible and challenging environment. Work space is quite comfortable for employees.
good,You knew what to expect each day coming into work. You had to be fast & productive throughout the day to fulfill orders on time. It was very tiring but the pay made it worth it to me. I learned many important work skills from this job. Management was good & the co-workers were nice & helpful. The hardest part was just the 10 hour shift & having to be fast & productive throughout that whole shift despite being tired or fatigue.
good,"En general buena,los compañeros muy buenos y buen rollo en  general"
good,It was fun but long hours with little break was too over whelming. Lunch is only 30 minutes but if you are in the back of the warehouse it takes more than 5 to 10 minutes to lunch area.
good,Very hard to get promoted from tier 3 PA to tier 5 AM. Amazon prefers you to have a BA. Some managers are fair and help while some tend to favor there PA's and give them what ever they want.
good,Working for amazon was not my best experience but it did have its up and downs. The best part about working for amazon was the pay. I got paid 11 dollars an hour which was actually good. However the work was unbearable. For the amount of work and hours I put in I think the pay should of been higher for everyone. Overall I gained a lot of new friends and experience.
good,"Le travail en lui même est difficile mais l'ambiance et le management sont présents."
good,this is a place where you get to choose who you want to work with most of he time. with so many different stations and so much work time flies by.
good,Overall not a bad place to work.  You're typically busy the entire shift.  Little chance of advancement unless you're willing to work weekends and/or relocate (for higher levels).
good,Each day is different because they move you around so much. Take you off of a job function that you want to be at and are good at. Management just cant leave you in one job the whole day I don't understand how that's efficient when your wasting more time walking to go do a different job rather than stay in something your good at.
good,"verry good conditions"
good,It was a very demanding role. I was Christmas temp and we had to make sure all roles were followed correctly to ensure the customers received their orders in time.
good,"Mandatory overtime, very tiring. Not too bad for the money you make. Allowed to wear whatever you want and you meet pretty awesome people."
good,I like working at Amazon it's a fast pace environment with a lot of great people. I have learned a lot and would definitely rate my experience as positive.
good,"i enjoyed that type of work but, was sometimes hard to deal with the employers and coworkers. The warehouse it's self was awesome."
good,communication through management could've been a lot better coworkers were always a pleasure to work with always plenty to learn
good,"Gathering the items a customer has ordered, scan them and make a box for them. Than place them in the box and tape the box and scan the box all under two minutes."
good,"It has a very good culture of work.I have learned many things like how does a company works,i what ways you can improve your business,what does a customer wants,how to deal with various types of customers,how to create your own identity on behalf of the company,how to manage things when they go wrong."
good,"it's easy to get hired and if you're willing to really hustle you can get paid. But it can be grueling, physically demanding, back breaking work. Carrying heavy packages in all types of weather. I got along with my co-workers but if you are a confrontational person this might not be a good fit for you."
good,"The hardest part of course was to work 60 hours per week during three consecutive weeks, but i would do it again if the company ned me ."
good,"Fun workplace and environment. Interactive atmosphere and fun to work alongside colleagues and seniors. The most enjoyable part of the workplace was the all seniors, team leads, managers used to work on the same floor as ours. In case of any query regarding the work or anything related to it, we can directly reach out to our leads or managers or HRs. The work kept on growing day by day as we kept on learning new things and workflow and also the competition among employees. But at the same time, the competition made the work enjoyable too."
good,"A typical day is walking 8-10 hours a day."
good,"management is nice ,listen to employees. hardest part of the job is the targets per hour. some times it is hard to meet them,"
good,"Working at Amazon when I arrive I meet with my supervisors and leaders to get a job agenda for the day, after doing so I began my job duties for the night and began to work in a team setting until the quota for the night is meet"
good,Amazon is all about numbers. Productivity is king. But Amazon offers you what most others don't - resources and opportunities in plenty to prove your worth. There's never a dull day.
good,There are a lot of incredibly smart people but at times the pace of the work is incredibly intense to a degree that people get burned out.  Major things are addressed while some smaller items of concern are overlooked.  It is a very dynamic workplace which is great but also a challenge as there isn't much time to take care of little things around the workplace.  Very tough place for a work/life balance.
good,"About ur  company i dont knew that much but i am dam sure amazon has a good company for a world.Culture is first and foremost at Indeed, which could be the biggest reason it is the #1 jobsite worldwide. Senior leadership does everything they can to make every employee happy and come to work excited. They are also HIGHLY visible every single day, including the CEO. Offices are open floor plans, so no corner offices for the senior leadership. They sit all over the building and amongst all of the different teams in their departments. Managers are highly experienced in the digital media/digital advertising field so you are learning from the best of the best in the industry."
good,"a good job but to many deliveries a day."
good,"good fun work place, salary not sufficient. a power packed work floor with songs and music, good management flexible to employees needs, co workers and team leaders are really good and very friendly."
good,A typical day consist of preparing for the day by going over the projected inventory numbers for the day. Along with getting mental and physical readiness.
good,"Amazon is a good place to work. I really enjoyed working with my peers and had some good managers. Although, a lot depends on who your manager is and Amazon's performance management system. Also, the higher up you go in the company, the harder it is to stay in managers good graces. There's a lot bureaucracy, so you might get a bad rating due to managers being pressured. Once I started getting bad ratings, it was all I could do to get above it. And when I did, the stigma still followed me like a dark cloud. After 5 plus years, I felt like they didn't want to pay the high wage for my position anymore. Maybe I stayed in the same position for too long. There was talk of the position changing from management and other folks that had been there a while were also let go before me. Amazon said I was let go for poor performance. Specifically, it was related to 20% of my position. If you're thinking of Amazon, be careful. Their performance reviews are really subjective, especially at call centers. I would not recommend staying in a call center leadership position for more than 2-3 years."
good,"Tiring after shift, I learned to be more productive and my quickness improved, Management dont have no contact with employees, Co-workers are friendly, hardest part of the job is alot of walking back and forth,"
good,"Great place to work for people in search of a long term career.  Encouraged to move around within the organization, and highly supported; although an intense work atmosphere."
good,"Run reports at SOS, time and attendance maintenance throughout shift, customer service. I've had the opportunity to learn different areas outside of my normal job function. Amazon offers great benefits."
good,"in the morning you get to stretch and listen to the plan of the day. We learned how to get along with many different people. Management was on point the whole time. Co-workers were nice, but amazon people wouldn't really communicate to integrity people. The hardest part of the job was to get up in the morning whenever we had over time and work 11 hours straight in 4 days. pay check was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Day at Amazon is not what i had in mind for an HVAC career. learned various trades basics UPS, transformers, generators, evap cooling, ATS, surge protectors, bldg automation. management is great but higher ups are not the friendliest and not conservative of employees, co workers are great, hardest part of the job is the change day to day the amazon way. most enjoyable part cant say I enjoy my job reason am looking to be back in the HVAC trade only."
good,"A lot of smart people. Definitely a good experience. My favorite part is mentorship: define the area that you'd like to improve, find the mentor  and work hard to excel yourself."
good,Amazon is focused on customers not so much the employee. The good side is that we can be ourselves mostly when interacting with customers. We don't do phony word for word pitches. There is no sales in my position. The pay is embarrassing for a company that can make billions on one good stock market day! Simply helping customers...that' what we do.
good,"One of the best companies within Tata group, which provides extensive training & creates the launch pad for college freshers. Has multiple consulting groups, for one to choose & excel."
good,"Amazon Is an ok place to work it is just hard to find balance because the shifts are 10 hours long, but you only have a four day work week. It is just harder for people who work night shift to adjust back to a regular schedule trying to wake up early on the weekends to do a hobby or something normal people do because we sleep most of the day. The managers are alright, mine are great though. It is just something to get used to because it is always common to get walked on like a doormat by someone there."
good,Focus on no one but yourself in this job because some one is going to try to get you fired. I recommend it for those with high patience.
good,"tive oportunidades de crescimento, na empresa através de meu esforço e a visão de meus superiores."
good,Have learnt many things from Amazon.Not only the technical part but  also to manage my work life as well as personal life.Am proud to work in Amazon.
good,"Workplace is fun !! As per the moto ""work Hard have fun make history "" Work Hard is more .. have fun is little less !! Making history is as per the associate's work !! The hardest part is when your managers and his managers knows you are good in the skills they require .. that's it you're done !! you will be loaded with work !! Management is cool !! I have learnt a lot here !! Inbound supply chain system !! Retail catalog creation and maintanence!! Procurement process .. stake holder communication.. Got to have more conversation with the vendors and customer! Learnt to deep dive, show customer obsession.. retail chain ... Report generation . maintaining sharepoint !! People management! Inventory & Vendor management !!As a whole you get to learn a lot when working in the biggest Online retail industry in the World!!"
good,Too many managers that don't know what they are doing.. Too many temps. Not enough OT. Need more work and time off balance.
good,"They took over my entire life for the short time I worked for Amazon.  They are the best company bar none to be a customer of, but I pan to never work for them again.  "
good,not hard work co-workers where great to work with mangenment was bad at all not say i didnt learn much because of my other line of work was the same as amazon the most enjoyable part of the job was working with the different kind of people
good,"Ten hour shifts 4 days a week, might encounter an obstacle in ones work with but is quickly resolve. Management isn't the best but they try everyday to be perfect for us associates. Hardest part of the job is knowing when its time to clock out being that everyone is so focused on doing the very best at what they do."
good,Amazon has many great qualities. I did learn some things while I was there. I learned how to move fast and be very productive. It was great working with a variety of different cultures. Being able to have goals set and accomplish those goals was awesome. The managers gave us daily rates that had to be met. It was a challenge and I enjoyed it.
good,Report to meeting at start of shift for any updates on production and warm up stretches. Then check assignment board to see which area and assignment was assigned for the day including pit operating. Inspect and track any quality errors found.
good,"Ich habe in schichten gearbeitet, Es war nicht schlecht, meine Kollegen waren alle net."
good,"A work day at Amazon really is an easy going day when it comes to being an order picker or forklift diver.  Management is ok, really high turnover rate when it comes Management. Co-workers really helps the day go by."
good,Managers seem to not care for people unless they have favorites. The co-workers are great people to get along with and I learned from this job that unless you are a favorite with the higher ups you will be treated with very little respect.
good,At Amazon a culture of favoritism is something associates learn to either deal with or fight your entire time with the company.  I learned more about the interview process because you had to apply for internal jobs posted. The most enjoyable part of my jobs were the results from customer feedback's.
good,"When I first started working for this company, things were just fine.  Seemed like a good sturdy company to work for.In the year before I left, changes took place that made me question my satisfaction with my choice of employment.  For example, the stock price of the company which was normally on the rise, dropped, and stayed down.  Also, the company started getting rid of some of the night shifts.  But management here always says not to worry because they are doing these things to benefit the company.  I don't know.  I decided to ""take the money and run""."
good,"A typical day consist of 10 hours 2 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch.  There is a constant work flow, once work slows in one area move to another area to assist with the daily work load.  Management is light on supervision.  You have several co-workers in and out sometimes there are as many as 200 to 300 associates in one are.  The hardest part of the job is the standing for 10 hours and the short breaks.  I enjoy seeing new faces daily."
good,"Manager need to think before they act to different issues,around the workplace."
good,"I had never used a computer before starting work with amazon."
good,"I would describe this job as a high paced industrial one that demands at least some type of physical fitness to function effectively (emphasis added).  And though the work is much, fellow employees including coaches with their business cubicle style sense of humor is needed and encouraging.  Management is strict, but unruffled and though sometimes one may have to jump through a few hoops to get basic questions answered it’s what you would expect in a warehouse with over thousands of people on every shift which adds to the constant reminding hum that, we are all just another number.  Though I'm more of a labor intensive person I must say that the repetition that this work requires is much and that's because I enjoy diversity but I do enjoy being on my feet.  Overall with experience, benefits, and pay I would enjoy working here again especially as an official Amazonian."
good,"Area Managers are shift leaders. A typical day requires delivering two start-up meetings - one at start of shift and one at lunch. AMs are responsible for ensuring that the operation (machinery and staffing) in their designated area runs smoothly. They support the supervisors, who are responsible for ensuring that the direction of the AM is carried out at the associate level. Area Managers are also responsible for process improvement within their areas, leading small focused groups in 'kaizen' events (Lean Continuous Improvement events). "
good,"You have to work in a fast pace, interacting with co-workers and managers. The technology Amazon use is excellent, and is incredible the amount of items that Amazon sell a day"
good,On a typical day i did picking but i learned the packing skill and how to use a scanner. The hardest part of the job is the concentration.
good,Hardest part of the job is working very repetitive motions in a schedule that looks like a 10-12 hour day for five days a week.
good,"Amazon warehouse is quite the typical warehouse job focusing on productivity in the warehouse to provide a better experience for the customer. The particular job I performed was quite solitary working alone most the whole time and only interacting with other employees in passing by. The most difficult part but basically the only thing that really matters if keeping up your rate of 'production', production being whatever it is your job entails, with management always strictly watching this. The upside of this is that if you are a hard worker like myself doing such a thing is not a problem what so ever. Working here taught me to bust my buns for the greater good of a company, and that if you do so there will be good things to come."
good,"Was picking orders using scaner and bringing them to packing."
good,At Amazon it was hit or miss for good and bad days. Somedays it was a steady flow work was constant then other days there was hardly any work and it was hard to get hours. As a forklift operator I was driven to adhere to all safety policies because that was the culture there. Task were easy to follow and requirewd great attention to detail.
good,Good company to work in terms of being out and about.  We are about to get out into the Sunshine and more of people person.
good,learned to be very punctual and always watch your surroundings and others around you. Give credit where credit is due.
good,Overall a good place to work but politics and poor management severely impacted morale.
good,The center was a well functioning building it was the largest id ever seen and they had all of the bacies covered for the most part as far as keeping things running. They had a guy for any and every possible problem thad did or could ever occor.
good,its ok according to what type of manager you get at the call center some are helpful and amazing makes you love being there then you go to a new one who drills you and makes you hate it
good,"Fast paced work place not suitable for everyone, 10 hour work days on your feet going up and down stairs on a normal basis."
good,overall not a place for beginners. The training plan for amazon data centers is not up to par. If you know everything about servers and linux this is a great place for you to work.
good,"A typical day at work will involve at the start planning how the event will be run, dividing employees into a group of team and following a well planned strategy that suits everyone. while working here, my confidence has increased, My communication skills are improving and the ability to plan and organise have now become a part of my everyday life. I am now able to adapt and adjust to different scenarios. the people I work with are excellent and are helpful. the hardest part of the job is mainly planning but it has to be done. the most enjoyable part of the job is having to do the job"
good,"Publishing Work"
good,was very happy to have a job for the Christmas break and learn new skills.
good,this was one of the hardest jobs ive have had. it was really stressful some days.
good,"Amazon is great for people who love to work in a warehouse for 40-60 hours a week and have no life outside of work. Other than being extremely stressful, they give the best benefits than any other job out there, including stock, medical insurance that starts the day of hire, and plenty of advancement opportunities."
good,nice place to work nice co workers did mostly inventory and making sure right supply was shipped off to right customers enjoyed hours and pay
good,I clock in. I look at my assignment for the day. I do my assignment for the whole 10 hours I am at work. I get two 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch.
good,"Great place to work if you have a blue badge. I was one of the best pickers in the whole department albeit, I was on a temporary/on going contract but throughout my time there was told blue badges (permanent badges) were available to those who continued to work hard and go above and beyond targets. I went so far beyond targets, 100% attendance, no points and no errors to then receive a phonecall on the Saturday, stating that I had been paid off and to come in, clear out my locker on Monday and sort out any holiday pay I was due ect. It was really disappointing. Especially going in on the Monday and seeing temp colleagues that weren't hitting targets and had multiple points were still there. This goes to show that they weren't giving out blue badges at all because if they were, I'd still be there. I spend that whole weekend trying to workout what it was that may have caused my termination  and I had no answers. I worked my extremely hard for that place in order to gain a blue badge. There was days the pain of walking was unbearable. The blisters on my feet were so far from painless you wouldn't believe, yet I pushed on through knowing a blue badge would soon be in my grasp. It was really sad to be told you no longer have a job there when you enjoyed it. My moms fiance works is the director of a bank and he informed me that big companies do this ""potential permanent position"" to lure you in, with no intention of actually employing you at all. You are just there to get the job done during the organisations peak times and disposed of when no longer needed. There were days when temporary"
good,Good to work with amazon.com. It is everyone's dream company to do our work.
good,"Travail speed où l'on connait pas l'ennui. Action Répétitive, et peut faire mal au dos."
good,the best part of the job was communicating with people from different backgrounds and learning about their culture
good,Since it is a Non -IT role and it includes inside warehouse outbond working profile on day to day basis.
good,da hab ich neue arbeitsatmosphere entdeckt sogar neue kollege und das hat mir spass gemacht und hab ich auch vieles neues gelernt
good,"Come in and get straight to work things went very quick there. I learned to pick, pack and sow there also to driver a forklift, and management was not to good because since there was so many people at Amazon people did not really get to deal with management . The people I worked with was cool it seem like the changed everyday so I got to meet many people. Many people say that Amazon was hard but to me I really thought it was easy. The most enjoyable part was meeting all the new people"
good,"This job is extremely hard to keep, its like your set up just to fail."
good,"A typical day at work would be to come in, scan badge to clock in, listen to supervisor give safety and production tips while everyone stretched out to prepare for their assigned work area, check board to find said assigned work station, work at said station until end of day (with breaks and lunch spread out to divide day into quarters), then clock out. Learned multiple warehouse-relevant skills, such as scanning products into the warehouse database and storing said products into appropriate storage areas. The management and co-workers are all friendly and can often be counted on for advise if one isn't sure about something. The hardest part of the job is the pace at which is requested of the employee, but the most enjoyable part would be seeing exactly what products are coming into the warehouse."
good,"-frequentemente estava viajando, "
good,Very very corporate environment. Sometime people don't like to be treated like a robot. All in all not a bad place to work.
good,"Always discovering"
good,"picking dept "
good,"O trabalho na empresa era apaixonante, pois eu lidava com lideranças comunitárias e moradores de 06 comunidades impactadas pela Petrobras, com a gerência local da Petrobras e com uma equipe de trabalho que eu precisava liderar. Eu fazia a intermediação das partes interessadas. Por exemplo: eu e a equipe fazíamos o planejamento das atividades, agendávamos com as pessoas interessadas (das comunidades, da empresa e da Petrobras) e fazíamos as reuniões e demais tarefas de campo. A equipe tinha um ótimo relacionamento interpessoal e executava bem o trabalho. O mais difícil era enfrentar as dificuldades da empresa (tanto financeiras quanto de gestão), pois nosso desempenho dependia das decisões da direção da empresa. No trabalho especificamente o mais difícil era lidar com os diversos interesses dos envolvidos, mas eu consegui contornar. O mais agradável do trabalho era ver as pessoas satisfeitas, a equipe feliz e com o sentimento do dever cumprido. Pois lidar com diversas pessoas com interesses diversos é desafiante e enriquecedor."
good,"collaboration correcte entre supérieurs et ouvriers"
good,"Working Enviroment."
good,"The day at amazon begin making some exercise for around five minutes. you got tree brakes during the day. The hardest part of the job is that you have to work very, very fast or you will lost your job."
good,Long work hours and few breaks and time for lunch. Management wasnt on the same wavelink. Things were un-coordinated 
good,Typical warehouse job.  Only have done one job there and it gets kind of boring after awhile.
good,"very long hours during busy seasons and overtime but watch out for non busy days! A daily required rate must be met on most work positions, physical work can be greatly expected depending on position (standing/walking for most of day, repetitive movements thought shift) Management can be very helpful in training processes, co-workers can vary, some positions require a partner, choose carefully! Hardest part of the day is maintaining a constant daily piece count in every area, otherwise you can be dismissed! Most enjoyable part of the day is your breaks, you get two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch break but be careful as if you leave to break late you won't get that time back and if you clock in late you will be marked as late and allowed 6 points before being dismissed! Among the cons are...no cell phones allowed within work areas, exceptions are cafeteria/designated break areas, short lunches as you must clock out/in, walk through metal detectors while leaving to breaks each time, which can shorten your lunch and that time you do not get back. Can be a tad tedious and if not careful you may receive a late point, after 6 your dismissed! Some days can be slow, resulting being sent home earlier, weekly hours can vary big time depending on seasonal sales, during busy season expect mandatory overtime and depending on assigned work schedule you two days off but under busy weeks expect to work on assigned days off. Busy seasons are a headache to arrive to work/leave by car as there is one major entrance. In my opinion this job can effect your Work/Life balance, if your attending"
good,"I worked the 5.30am to 1.30pm one week and the 1.30 to 9.30 the next, although they were easy shifts it was quite hard adjusting every single week."
good,packer et etiqueter les commandes correctement afin qu'elles arrivent en bon état chez le client.
good,Very intensive and fast pace company. Lot of experience in all areas.
good,"Nice company with nice co-workers. This is a job for very hard workers, lots of walking up to 15 miles of walking on 10 shifts 4 days a week. Decent pay but you work for every penny."
good,"Working in a warhouse is definately not for everyone. I do not mind working in a fast timely manner, however the management team does not have all of their stuff together. The senior ops managers make all the decisions and some times its very hard for the manager to adapt. I have learned how to use amazon computer systems, understand the different quality of products. A great experience because you are working with many different people. The warehouse is very diverse. But the best thing about working with Amazon, you know you are making some person at their house happy to receive their package."
good,"Working as a picker, I was on my feet all the time -- for a very long period of time.I found it a lot more fun once I got my PIT license and could do air picking. Walking around for 12 hours at a time is for the birds....Either way, you get a lot of exercise, and, especially during peak, there is a lot of opportunity for overtime. The area managers are great to work with and very supportive of their team. The senior management, however, are generally very standoffish - especially if you're working for their staffing agency and haven't converted over to a regular Amazon employee. As a whole, they are all big sticklers for quality and speed. Safety too - but that's understandable. They're very unforgiving with their point system and clocking in and out on time. The breaks are very short. Senior management likes to lurk in the aisles, especially their safety guys, looking for reasons to write people up - especially if you're holding your scanner while pushing a cart, pushing the cart the wrong way, backing out of an aisle with your cart or on a PIT, trivial stuff like that. I don't think there was a lot of planning put into this facility from an equipment or logistics standpoint because from that aspect it was a nightmare during Christmas peak. People were constantly waiting around for empty carts to use and getting yelled at because they weren't looking hard enough for carts that weren't even available. Obviously they have some planning issues to work out - they really seem to be making a lot of stuff up as they go - but it's an alright place to work if you want or need to do"
good,"Baptism by fire-- you will work hard, learn a ton, and appreciate a slice of free pizza as if it were the $5k holiday bonus you don't receive."
good,"Learned to work using excel, management is open and good.Would loved if I could have got an oppurtunity to learn more."
good,I walked 12-15miles per night. Picking up customers orders on a cart and taking them to be packed out. I learned how to use a scanner. The management was good and my co-workers were great. I hardest part was the walking. The most enjoyable part was meeting all types of new people
good,"Trabalho intenso via home office, aprendi muito sobre como lidar com clientes de diferentes regiões do Brasil. Adquiri boa experiência em diversos segmentos por se tratar de uma importadora atuante com produtos bastante diversificados."
good,Amazon has nice work culture. learned about E-commerce business. i was in product pricing and product marketing team .
good,"Typical work day began around 0600 for managers in order to do the staffing according to the amount of shipments we would be receiving during that shift. The associates would arrive around 0655 for start up at 0700 and would have breaks at 0930 and 1500 with a lunch at 1200. After absentee report, a reshuffling of associates would occur before 0830. As associates would leave for various reasons, changes in truck shipment schedules, and productivity needs would occur, I would have to move people to ensure that goals for the day were met."
good,fun place to work and an easy going atmosphere. managers are a good to work with and colleagues are of various backgrounds. very transparent
good,it was nice working there they paid well it just ended to fast
good,"Do not take a Fulfillment Center manager position just because the pay is great. It is a lot of hard work, make sure you are a cultural fit for this."
good,"The company itself is awesome to work for. I absolutely LOVED my job!!! But I was promised an at home position before I even did my training. After 2 weeks of training and 4 weeks of working on site, they were unable to fulfill this agreement."
good,Little structure with high pressure environment. Mandatory work on Christmas and extremely demanding work schedule. Management is lacking and orientation to leadership positions lack clarity and information.
good,good pay
good,"Amazon was a great place to work during the short time I was there. Breaks were a little short, but I excelled in my area. Although I was put on a list of amazing Amazon workers, I was still laid off after only 30 days of employment."
good,"I came in as a manager and have learned that usually outsiders get more pay than promoting from within. The work load can be confusing due to how hard it is to figure out HOW to get something done, i.e finding out who the POC is, finding out the process for your building, things like this seem to get made up building to building and can significantly hinder management getting things done. At the delivery station level, the business does operate as a start up, with big sometimes unannounced changes happening quickly. Things that have a significant impact on operations often get rolled out with very little communication but serious service repercussions. Over time that can get frustrating if you like order and organization in your work environment.  If you like winging it most of the time, this is the environment for you. Overall I tend to like those I work with but am continually frustrated by lack of contingency plans and poor communication."
good,"Great benefits"
good,"Amazon does encourage and attempt to give off the energetic and fun-loving vibe and claim to have a work hard, play harder attitude. However, the actual work is very repetitive and in my particular area it was designed so that with the only exceptions being breaks, water,  and the restroom I would not even have to leave my little work area. It makes for a very long 10 hour shift."
good,"Great job, great hours, great pay, and benefits. The hardest part of my job was my assignments during peak season. Overall, I loved working at amazon."
good,"very bad management between the virtual and physical part of the job. Poor performance rating system, unfair lay off system. They set you for failure just to lay you off while hiring new people"
good,Une très bonne experience de travailler chez Amazon par rapport à l’ambiance de travail aux managers ect... par contre au niveau de la rémunération les intérims de n’en paie pas correctement sa et se trompent souvent sur les paies !
good,My overall experience was good. Amazon is a good job for anyone looking to learn new skills or want something different. I would recommend an amazon job to anyone.
good,It  was a great job i really liked it there. I’m no longer there because i was hired as seasonal so i helped them during there busy holiday season. But working there gave me great experience for other warehouse jobs and a great work ethic as well.
good,"Fast Paced, very competitive, no work life balance. Very long work day for Area Managers.10 hour days 4 days a week is more like 12-14 hours a day 4-5 days a week. Great benefits and compensation (base pay, signing bonus, stock options). Quick career advancement. Provides an opportunity for GED/High School graduates and new immigrants to Canada to advance their career with good compensation. Many of the MBA graduates working as Operations Managers lack industry experience and are too focused on advancing their careers, they sometimes forget to treat people with respect and show empathy. I would not recommend working here for anyone with a young family."
good,Working there was fun amd i enjoyed it alot i was sad to leave but i had a better job opportunity somewhere else with more money and closer to home. Good job
good,They pick and choose who they want to help. Their very unappreciative and don’t care about their workers. If you come to them with a problem they act like they don’t care they go by favoritism.
good,The pay is good for the work. Esp in this state. If you are young with no kids its great. The schedule is also good. Flexible work hours if you have enough time to use for possibly going in late etc. The work hours often feel long because it takes a bit to make it to the breakroom for break times. In inbound the work is often critiqued but leadership helps. The constant reminders has stressed a lot of people out. Less critique would let the employee pick up steam and work better.
good,"Some things about the job are great but getting up the ladder is near impossible if you have any type of learning disability. The company has not learned the value of placing employees in positions where their strengths are. They expect everyone to be able to climb a tree, even if you're a fish."
good,The insurance cost are best I've had in my work career. It's really the only reason I took the job. It's a job that can be hard on your body if you're a hard worker. There's plenty of peers that don't put forth a good effort.
good,If you are focused on making money this job is great. You must show initiative or you will be in same position as long as you work there. Some managers do show favoritism to certain employees.
good,"●	Process and load products onto incoming trailers "
good,This position is very physical it is a 10 hour position on your feet for 4 days a week.  They offer a lot of overtime so if you really need money this is the place to work. The Coworkers are all very nice. Everybody is respectable and gets along. You do not see any issues with coworkers. Management is always kind and positive.
good,"Turnazioni 7-15  15-23:30 a volte il sabato dalle 14 alle 20."
good,"You can gain a lot of experience starting at Amazon. Takes awhile to work yourself up in the company, but it depends on how hard you work. "
good,"It’s a good place to work, not for a long time, with the physical work your body wears out quickly. Some managers are very supportive others couldn’t care less. "
good,"I loved working for this company. It was a new facility, and there wasn't any upper management and HR available. Which is bad, if and when a issue arises."
good,Amazon is a great place to work for. Very fast paced. Amazon doesn't give their employee's long enough break inbetween. Working and moving non stop. Two ten minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch.
good,Just work too many hours and never sees the pay but overall it's a pretty good job you have some nice management and you have some management only deal with family members
good,Great place to work at if your really ready to work. They offer great benefits throughout the company for you and your family. You also have the options to transfer to other facilities if needed.
good,Good place to work. Great benefits but workload is very overbearing. Two breaks a day. One at 11 am for 30 minutes another at 3pm for 30 minutes. Generally a good place to work.
good,Amazon can be hard on the body and mind sometimes but offers much more with the daily routine. Many benefits and flexibility with time off allows anyone experienced or trying to move up opportunity in the company.
good,Started as a temp at peak for xmas in gourock scotland 2008 was hard at first but was given great training and quickly found my feet the associates where very  helpfull and friendly and after a year i got a full time job.From there i was awarded enployee  of the month three times and took up an ambasiter role training new starts at peak and through out the year .I the got a job with the con soldation team which i found very enjoy
good,Working at amazon you literally have no outside life you have to compromise everything around your job there is no leeway at all. Good checks and hospitality.
good,I love working at Amazon nice people and organized fast paced but not stressful great job to work at fun outstanding very good with fellow safety and respectful
good,You'll work like crazy and become exhausted when you get home. They do have vendors come out every night where you can purchase food though. Be prepared to learn multiple jobs as you work there because they will train you to do them
good,"The job was okay has a good flexibility schedule. The only problem I had was the management because they made a lot of decisions that I disagreed with, but they still decide to do it there way."
good,"Long hours but only 4 days a week.  Good pay and great benefits. Can learn the different departments they have to offer.  At times, can advance in your career."
good,"Job is great if more organized, set route and more stabilized dispatching times. I believe because of the way prime members can order it effects the productivity of the warehouse and the ability to be on a ""timed schedule"". Some contractors are rushed while others can "" Dilly-daly"" And it puts strain on the drivers."
good,"Good. Got a lot to learn how am organisation works. Ir was my first job so yes, created lot of mistakes amd hence, need to be extra vigilante on finding the next job."
good,my review for Amazon work was something new I never did before.  but as time goes by I become to love it. my job there is to pack what being ship out in the box and label it for delivery
good,I worked the night shift which gave more independent working and time management. People are nicer because they are under less stress. I learned how to manage an entire section of the warehouse alone.
good,"You get a chance to get to know lot of people from all walks of life. Everyone has their cliques and has fun with each other in and outside of work. Work hard, have fun, make history is thier motto"
good,"il faut être en bonne condition physique, ne pas avoir peur de travailler être courageux."
good,The best part of the job was being around many different people and working along different ethnic backgrounds to have experience with others. It allows new workers to seamlessly feel welcomed in working there.
good,If you need full time plus over time work at Amazon. They have many shifts and opportunities to grow. The longer you work there the more benefits you get. Amazon also give you the opportunity to start your own company.
good,E estado trabajando en Amazon lo que pasa que por las concesiones me bloquearon la cuenta y a la espera estoy para incorporarme de nuevo
good,"Good company, great pay, the job I'd great (depending on your job), Peak Season here is HORRIBLE (but that overtime pay 🤑). You're doing "
good,"Started out okay, became a bit overwhelming working nights"
good,"Travail posté 05h40 à 12h50 ou 13h20 à 20h30."
good,This is a job needed for someone that works very hard and in shape. They may have upped the pay but fr the amount of work and pace they ask you to do it doesn't match.Work smarter not harder.
good,They have good pay but people don’t have communication skills such as mangers. Work stations are always dirty. It’s a lot of dust floating around. You probably will break out a few times. You have little time for bathroom breaks which i believe is wrong. The fourth floor has no fans some people have passed out. Am care wont let you lay down if you feel sick or is ready to pass out or anything. They actually don’t care lol.
good,"Worked as an inbound sorter at the fulfillment center located in Schertz, TX. Job is very physically demanding and expectations as to how many items per hour can be properly stored as taught in training versus how items are actually stowed is not practical. Also there are also favoritism shown when items are brought to your location for stowing."
good,Amazon is a great place to work with good benefits and really good pay. You will be moving around and walking for the majority of the time so invest in comfy shoes likes sneakers. Hard to work when then don't accommodate online school and can't balance the work shift with the class assignments.
good,"Amazon would be a great place to work if most of their management was qualified to manage.  The lack of knowledge of how to manage makes working there pretty tough.  No two managers are on the same page with the information that they provide to the workers."
good,"Bien pour un job de dépannage ou job d été"
good,"Innovation de l’entrepôt, esprit d’équipe et sécurité irréprochable. "
good,"fun stressfree workplace, employment friendly workspace, good breaks between work to focus more, fun activities and rewards and recognition events to encourage the employees to work better and faster."
good,I really  enjoyed my time with my employer and the prizes that we win.and when peak season be here I can get all the overtime that I want and we can work in different department.
good,"Solid company to work for good pay and benifits. they offer full time, part time,seasonal and flex positions the attendance policy is strict but workable decent management and plenty of room for advancement."
good,A great place if you have a permanent position and not on a zero hours contract. Very driven by productivity which can be stressful if your mobility is not as good as most people.
good,Every day as an area manager is something different. There area always new obstacles to overcome and working with a large team every day is the best part. Expect to be walking at least 10 hours of the day. Associates work 10 hour shift but managers should expect to be there at LEAST 12 hours a day if not 14 during normal season. During peak season the work week for managers is more than 70 hours a week. Absolutely terrible for work life balance or impossible for anyone with a family.
good,Non stop go.  The Safety culture has swung too far to the opposite side of holding people accountable and spends way too much energy into trying to engineer out peoples poor behaviors.  The company is still growing super fast and there are lots of opportunities within different business units.
good,"I used to love working for amazon but changed a lot of their systems and now everyone is basically competing with each other. The work is a fast pace, I'm a packer and the rate that you have to be at is high and you can talk without it going down."
good,The staff has lack communication with a Deaf person working with other people helping for packer/scanner. They don’t understand how to sign language in Hillsboro. They could be discriminated on you.
good,"The job is great, but the hours they provide is hard to live off. You would need a second job if you aren't in school. You can wear whatever you want as long as it isn't a safety hazard. The management is excellent.. they will do whatever they can to help you with your problems."
good,some days are better than others like any other job. people are generally nice. It's a big building and most days I just felt like another number and if my numbers of performance were lacking well all I can say is im not a robot.
good,Fast paced job good job for those who want to make a career and move up the ladder show what it takes and they have what you want they offer to help you with your education if you decide on furthering it
good,It’s fast paced but they will work you like a Hebrew slave but pays ok. Some of the floor PA’s talk to the employees like dirt with no respect. Most of them act as if they don’t like to help you.
good,"It is good if you are looking for something short term.."
good,"This job requires real work! The breaks are too short if you ask me, especially if you are there 12 hours. There is a huge issue with lack of training! The whole site needs to enforce policy because the employees pretty much do whatever they want. Amazon offers great benefits that start day one and do not cost your whole paycheck! Moving up is hard, but you can do it."
good,"Thats nice place to start,good benefits,good day offs,the hardest part of the job is that you standy and they should swutch people to another schedule or shift every 3-6 months"
good,Work-from-home opportunity was a blessing. Hardest part of the job was handling the calls with irate customers. Management was thorough and understanding when you have an issue and will help find a solution.
good,It was ok. It had the same amount of pros and cons. I mostly enjoyed being able to work by myself for the most part. Time management is alsos crucial.
good,"Orientation was boring and lasted a couple hours."
good,Management wasn't the best and can be unreasonable with you but depends on the managers since the other one i had no problems with until one called me a lair for going to rest room when she asked me were i went.
good,I liked the job at first it was great but I started not to like my hours I wasn't getting over 20 hours only had money to get to work no money for other things I may have needed to do
good,"The job is just ok. My DSP / Amazon wants us to Deliver 160+  packages in 10 hours. Amazon don't account for time we have to go to the warehouse to find our packages & load our Van's that takes at least 30 to 45 minutes. The packages IS NEVER near our vans. I usually get between 120 to 170 stops & don't have time for a break & we have to drive an hour away to get the location & God forbid it's in a rural area. They ARE THE WORST, no connection & the stops are miles apart with dirt & gravel roads & houses are a mile from the main road. Amazon makes it impossible to finish in a 10 hour shift. We all should get less than a 100 stops per day but that's just wishful thinking. Other than that the pay is ok & could be better for all the work we are doing."
good,"It is my wish to get the opportunity to work with the company as a permanent and full-time employee."
good,"The job give you independent but it is hard to get time to work, especially many people recruit and they pick the shift to work less than 5 seconds. So you have to fight to get your work hours."
good,Amazon is a very fast-paced environment.  There are certain rates employees have to make every hour.  Workers need to pay attention to detail as well.
good,I Learned To Always Have A  guarantee ride to From work . and I Also Learned Don’t Apply For Jobs That Are Too Far From You . And To Always Call Your Job And Don’t  Call Late When Something Comes Up .
good,This job isn’t for everybody. Depending on your lifestyle it may not be for you. Single with no kids. It’s perfect. You can work as much as you want. Chill place to work
good,"Amazon can be a great company to work for! depending on the position. Great benefits and there is always room for advancement. New full-time warehouse associates( level 1) tend to have difficulties adjusting to working culture as it can be physically and mentally tedious but a go get it mindset seems to be key in their flourishing.  Process assistants (level 3) who are basically assistant managers, roles range from coaching, onboarding, associate assessment, leading department meetings and also filling in when it is necessary during area manager vacations. The most difficult thing about the process assistant roles is associate engagement due to the number of associates per team. Area Managers roles tend to be a little more difficult, their job security tends to rely heavily on the individual success of the team. Which can be a good or bad thing."
good,"I think meeting the 7-8 takt time is not doable for people who are older, just started the job, and those with past injuries. They want you to be fast at the expense of your body breaking down to the point where it hurts to walk. Glad I’m leaving this job in August."
good,"I would get there and get right to work after our safety meetings, hard part was just maintaining speed but if that is no problem for you, you'll succeed"
good,"It’s a little fast pace it’s really easy to get fired , but they pay really good and the work is pretty easy. Overall the job is really is to work in great environment"
good,Learning new methods on how fast-paced the manufacturing industry is changing the work keeps you very busy the problem most companies have gotten away from taking time to talk and listen to the men and women who are doing the work give them a choice because at the end of the day we are all trying to make a living go 🏡 to our 👪 's👪
good,"-a typical day was boring and repetitive"
good,"Pros: People are intelligent, amazing and fun to work with. Good location. Lots to learn."
good,"I would drive myself to Tracy which I live an hour away. Typically, I arrive 20 minutes early to clock in 5 minutes early. "
good,"It's an amazing place to start your career. But after it will be addiction because of it's work culture. It's a fun-filled environment to work. You can get to learn lot of things to grow in your career. Work life balance... It depends on deliverable timelines and how you manage it. "
good,"Amazon is a good place to work, but you have to be able to work around certain conditions, like standing long hours or having minimal social interaction. Typically, you would enter, get to the meeting area and start the day going to your station. The management is helpful, and you work at your station doing your job the whole day. I never got that good an idea of the workplace culture as my job had me isolated from most workers, but overall the interactions I had were nice and fun. The hardest part of the job I had was the isolation, working long hours standing and picking with minimal sunlight rarely talking to anyone. The enjoyable parts were working with robots."
good,"This job is certainly not for everyone. Yes it pays well... but it does take a toll on your body! Pure labor work. Truthfully this company has extremely high expectations/standards for their workers, and if I’m being honest, I felt as though I was a actual robot. Be weary of making mistakes!!! They can really cost you your job.. it’s not a joke. They take this very seriously!"
good,A typical day at work there is packing and shipping orders in a very paced environment.  Scan items and pack in a timely matter.  Constant relocating station to station depending on the amount of work there is.
good,If you're looking for employment and don't mind hard work go to Amazon. They take care of their own and the people there are good workers. It's a good environment.
good,not a bad place to work but i wouldnt recommend it for everyone. the pay is great. the onyl thing i didnt really like was my position(picker) and the mandatory overtime.
good,It's good to start your career at amazon. But after it will be addiction because of it's work life balance and leave policy. Fun-filled environment to work. But don't expect salary hike and promotions within 2 years. It depends upon the management.
good,I love to work with Amazon. Here is much more opportunity to grow your working experience. Amazon process is to good for work. I always encourage people for work with Amazon.
good,"This company is great a great place to work if you're a fan of keeping your head down and never asking questions. If you exceed rates and show you're willing to work job advancement can come quick for someone trying to go from a tier 1 associate to a T3 associate. After that, it's all based on schooling and interviews."
good,At Amazon your manager has a big impact on your experience from work life balance to work load. Some managers believe in having a work life balance and other do not.
good,"scanner les colis "
good,"Long shifts are manageable especially with the pay but, it is taxing especially with increasing performance standards. As a picker, you are isolated for hours which can be a problem for some. Personally, I found that the culture needed improvements, as breaks were often spent listening to others complain about their workload."
good,"Making rates, not enough work hours to make 40 hours a week, not having proper ""vest"" for picking part of job, otherwise a good job for compensation received"
good,"I work extremely hard and pride myself on my work attitiude "
good,I love it but I hard to live because peak seasons was over . Working there you must be strong and well feet to work .and also well hydrated and also working there you must keep to time
good,Very nice Job love the job very fast paced just gotta learn the ropes it’s mainly night shifts and you’ll be tired but it’s still really very coworkers are super nice as well
good,"Dans l'ensemble ça va, quelques petit bémol mais..."
good,"Ok place to work, but management was stichy. The management had their picks and if they didn't like you you felt it. Watching your every move couldn't go to bathroom in peace."
good,The job is a great job for being able to receive benefits as of 1st day of working and which are really great benefits.  Pay is fair and hours are manageable.  It is exhausting and be prepared to have feet hurting during the week from 10 hours of continuous standing/walking with minimal rest periods.  The management is up in the air due to many being inexperienced individuals so there is lack of direction and management.  You hope to keep up with the pace of the work week in order to maintain productivity so individuals are not written up for unsatisfactory results of less than 100%.  Overall it is a well rounded easy to apply position with great benefits.
good,"Relaxed workplace, production driven employment. Amazon is a fun place to work, especially if you love moving about 24/7. Everyone is unique in their own way."
good,"Its an ok working place ,but I am not fond of it being my permanent job. Would prefer to be paid more and for it to be considered a warehouse and not a retail store."
good,"I never thought i am going to quit that job it was lots of fun busy busy all the time and times goes fast I used to work 10 hours shift "
good,"you're tracked electronically for time on/off task as well as having a rate to hit each day/week. If you work hard you can move up, but it's very competitive and you have to put in years there without a degree."
good,It is Fast past. quicker a customer order is placed the quicker it can be found if it is place in the right bin.The management is good they work with you to learn things and to support your job performances and help you inprove. the hardest part is trying to keep up especially if your a picker.
good,"It was an okay experience, and its a good place to work if you dont mind a set schedule. Management does what it can and doesnt really like to get into defending employees, the limitations, its one way or another"
good,"I liked the idea of working from home, but it really was not for me.  The call times are insane.  It is a great company if you like that sort of thing.  They are very strict about a lot of things, which is good, but it felt somewhat robotic.  I felt like I always received a corporate response and not a personal response."
good,"Working with Amazon in my opinion, is a per individual experience. Therefore, it is a bit unfair for me to give such an opinion. But I will add this much, you will get your exercise and steps in, especially if you are counting steps! Lastly, if you love great customer services ACROSS THE BOARD...? You will do your absolute best at providing such customer care/delivery services."
good,"I loved to work, still them said I had to work 55 hours a week. They said, it is not a chose, I have to. I left, it is impossible. Agency management was arrogant. Later I emailed to Amazon manager, she called me to dispute, but I found other job very quickly, so just left."
good,"Amazon was a great place to work, I loved it. But I would constantly be written up for using the restroom. I even had documentation from a doctor and that did absolutely nothing. My write ups for restroom usage prevented me from becoming permanent. One day before my term was over my mother was hospitalized and when I spoke to human resources I was forced to resign, and was told that I would be eligible for rehire. It has now been 6 - 7 years and the company refuses to rehire me at all."
good,"Adoro lavorare con le persone e poterle supportare nella loro crescita."
good,"Management changes so often, its a job focused on productivity and keeps you on the go the whole time. The good part of working here is the promotions."
good,"Don't expect a career with Amazon. if you need money and want to work then amazon is the place to work. Each manager is different none are bad and none are great. the pay is average. Work hard and it will show. Plenty of options to take time off if needed. Keep an eye on your amazon hub that is the lifeline to working there . The warehouses are so big that by the time you get to your breakroom you only have 2 minutes to sit and then its time to head back ,"
good,10 hour shifts that got pretty boring after a while (i worked doing pick.) that was the only thing that bothered me. The benefits and pay were great at amazon
good,Very Busy work days. Deadlines tough but reasonable. Training was thorough. Management team was well organised. The work itself was very easy to pick up and support was good.
good,"Worked during peak season (OCT 21 - JAN 5TH) as a box sorter at the CLT2 distribution center facility. The job was through Integrity staffing, it's an agency located inside their building. The job is fast paced but relaxed it relied on a scanning per hour system.  Employees in inbound had to keep a 100 percent rate per week. As long as you keep on working steadily and not talking all the time it should be achieved fairly easy.  They also give you a fair point system based on attendance. Once again very fair.  The managers and supervisors leave you alone as long as you are fulfilling a descent rate. Having said that this job is only temporary. Since they implemented the $15hr they have overhired and many ex employees are looking to come back. Once again, you are only going to get hired as a temp worker and they can let you go as soon as work slows down. There is no job security and everyone that started with me was let go as soon as peak season was over.  Event though is a great place to work I cannot recommend Amazon for its lack of job security even the supervisors are shown the doors often."
good,"It was good. I would always love to go there if everything remains alright. Anyone should go there and make a try what is being offered. Probably I spent some busy days over there, but it was worth going there."
good,It was all about work and nothing else.  After being on your feet for hours you would have a very short break because by the time you got to the break area it was time to go back to the line because some of the assembly lines were so far away.  couldnt socialize or have enough time to talk to someone
good,"I joined in September 2018.  The job was enjoyable and very fast paced.  You were treated very well initially, any complaints etc were addressed quickly.  The only complaint I had was that once they had finished with you working  11 hours a day, 5 days a week.  Not a problem at all doing the hours or days at all.    But when you are no longer required, its like that is it, you are no longer needed."
good,"highly dynamic and competitive work culture"
good,"learned time management, amazon management team could've been better. Doing the same work all night standing for 12hrs straight was the worst part, also managers. Most enjoyable part was the days off, the pay & the friends I made."
good,"Amazon is a very quick paced environment, full time hours and great benefits. With that being said I plan on looking for better opportunities that's why I am currently furthering my education."
good,The job is pretty good. Safety is always put first. They have health/body care unit within the facility.The management could be a little better when it comes to honesty.
good,I love working at amazon i love the work that i do and the associates i work with..Its a great place to grow in the company. I would love to be on full time staff
good,"Amazon like any company has it's positives and negatives. A typical work day is 10 hours of non stop on your feet decision making. I have learned how the big companies work in distribution. Management is young and for the most part inexperienced. The work place is very diverse culturally. We have employees for all over the world. Making it interesting to see how to manage all those different beliefs and work backgrounds. The most enjoyable part of the job is that even though we do the same thing everyday, the days are never really the same. Each day brings it's own challenges and opportunities!"
good,"if your slow, your done for. if your not meeting peek the get out, cause they will replace you, benefits are nice as well as pay, but working there can be like walking on eggshells."
good,It was a great place to work but look out they will do you dirty when they decide to lay you off. Everything was great until I came in one morning and my badge did not work and let me in the building. I notified the security lady and she told me to stand by. I waited for 45 mins (well past the start time of my shift) and a management person came out to tell me that they will be letting me go but I was more than welcome to come back in 1 year! They could have called me and gave me the news over the phone and saved me a 60 mile round trip.
good,"On a typical day  AA spend most of their time giving feedback to their associates on rates, behavior, and quality.  AM's work with their associates on any barriers that they are experiencing.  There are no chairs just door desk. So all of your day is spent standing or walking.  Every decision made has to have the math that supports it, so if you don't like trying to figure out the whys this is not the job for you.   They do take care of their associates.  The most enjoyable part of this position is interacting with the associates.  You don't have to stay in your role for a certain period should you decided to change positions.  Discount could be better."
good,"I worked for amazon part time for a couple of months. I was student and I worked Saturdays and Sundays. I left because I found another job with more flexible hours. While I was there, I was paid well at $14 per hour but the warehouse was grueling at times. Long shifts of just standing boxing items. Still not a bad job."
good,"As a dock worker, we were constantly on the go, whether it was loading in freight, sorting it out, or making sure it went to the correct place in the massive facility. We were the first people to touch it in the door, so we understood the importance of our jobs."
good,"working in the freezer sucked! You never know when you will be placed in the freezer to stock and or pick. It's very, very cold in there and you can keep getting cold picks back to back"
good,"Very good earnings for job which does not require much skill, however can be very frustrating when trying to communicate with customer service or staff in the warehouses."
good,"Stow was slow-paced. I learned how to use the scanner they gave us, so that was cool. Honestly, it was also very fast-paced when it needed to be, and competitive if it came to staying after the holiday season."
good,"Overall its a nice first job for anybody who is looking for part time, full time or just looking to do something in their free time.if you need the money definitely give it a chance."
good,"Management wasnt that great. I just got my job done and left. Enjoyed driving all the machines that i was placed on. I also enjoyed most of the people that worked there, that were actually nice."
good,"Great coworkers and culture. They try to make it less stressful, but ultimately the stress got to me and made me so sick, I had to relocate back in with my parents."
good,"I worked as a Warehouse worker for the PrimeNow. Although I loved the people I worked with, I hated the management. They never explained that I needed to check the portal website to schedule your shift, whereas other places had defined schedules. As such, I was terminated twice from Amazon because I ""abandoned"" my position eventhough the management people told me ""wait for us to contact you""."
good,"Although the 10 hour shifts for four straight days are tiring, it is a decent place to work at and I found it okay. The only problem I had was not being able to work as efficiently as I could since I was always standing and felt the break times were not enough."
good,Amazon is what you make of it. Ive worked there almost 2 years and ive seen better days there. Not all your coworkers are trustworthy but thats anywhere. Like I said its all what you make of it.
good,"Distribution warehouse. Including inbound loading, outbound sorting, pallet construction, pallet finalization, and pallet loading/unloading. Multiple shifts available for flexible hours."
good,"It's a face paced environment. If you are flexible and depending on what department you start in, you can succeed in this company. It is definitely somewhere for someone just starting in the industry."
good,Working fast hot in there.You are making pods there is really good money you can make. Alot of over time for the people that need it. You get a 15 min break then a hour for lunch.
good,Expect to be worked to the bone but you are well compensated for your time as a manager.  The company does follow its values and beliefs and truly does revolve around the customer which is refreshing to see.
good,"I like the job, but I wasn't a fan of Management and how they run projects in there. I noticed there was a lot of favoritism and if you were on your manager's good side, you'd get nice things, even tho you weren't the best at packing/picking/etc. I was a Problem Solver and I liked my role, but it took almost a year for hem to finally put me on as a Problem Solver. The place also tends to only move people around if its in demand, if nothing was available, you were stuck doing the same job for as long as you work there."
good,"If you are ok with top out pay being $15.00 without a college degree, and if you like challenges and a fast paced work environment, then I suggest this job for you. You start out at 11.50 and every six months you get a $ .25 pay increase, the fourth and fifth year it's $.50 every 6 months until top out of your fifth year.The only way to move up is to have a 4 year college degree, there are positions you can move into without a degree but they are limited. Flexibility in relocating will greatly increase chances of moving into higher tier positions. Amazon is pretty good about supporting and offering continued education, school accommodations are also granted. The benefits are great too with stock sharing and extra pay for perfect attendance. You get a lot of time off but use it wisely, don't get caught up in the time off culture. Just remember every job has it's ups and downs, give it a chance. You can meet some great people."
good,"Intéressant et agréable "
good,"This job is about 50% mental and 50% physical."
good,The managers really didn't care for the workers. They wanted you to work hard and fast even if it was dangerous. During peak season you were often asked to stay past your work schedule and would be blamed if you went over hours. I had to work on school and the managers would not help me set a good schedule to work which is what made me quit in the first place.
good,"The warehouse jobs are extremely physically demanding.  The company benefits are wonderful.  They have great insurance and retirement options.  However, the daily hours are very long.  And it is extremely hard on your body if you are not used to going ten or more hours a day without sitting down.  The pace is fierce and you can hurt yourself if you are not careful.  The jobs are not designed to be a retire type job, although, the supervisors are great to work with.  I can honestly say all supervisors were always professional and courteous. It could be a place where you would want to retire, if Amazon would make some changes in the work schedule requirements such as working only eight hours a shift instead of ten or more.  And they definitely need to build some break time into the day for their employees."
good,"It was enjoyable to work at amazon, I don't have much to compare my time there to, but I would happily recommend working there if you are okay with moving for 10 to 11 hours a day."
good,"Excellent if you want an extra income as a part time, but stressful for full time employees. Good benefits and perks as birthdays roundtables, gift cards."
good,"The number of hours you get can vary a lot from week to week, from 50+ hours to almost nothing depending on sales volume. Its probably not a good place to work if you depend on your check to survive. It would have been better if not for mandatory overtime days. It's a four day work week typically, but Amazon holds one or two days not on your regular schedule hostage, and requires you to be there for those days when called on with almost no notice. It makes it difficult to find a second job to supplement the slow weeks."
good,Anyone starting out looking for a good first or second job should look into Amazon. It's a nice atmosphere for young adults or college students and you can work around your schedule.
good,"Loved the company, loved the environment, loved how faced paced it was - just got burned out. Leaving Amazon was the biggest mistake I have made in my professional career."
good,This company does promote growth within. Production is all they care about they will overlook some safety issues just to get the product out the door and once your hurt they will get rid of you.
good,Always at the work station. Break time is the bare minimum. Hardest part is hitting the goal since everyday the goal was higher. The work schedule was convenient 3 days a week.
good,when training it is all hands on. they teach you your position and they train you for 4 days before they put you on the floor to start working. Always working in different areas.
good,"a good job but not a career starter"
good,"If you work in TRMS as an investigator, be prepared to waste your life with repetitive work that leads you nowhere. Poor pay and upper management doesn't care about you. You're seeing as an easy-replaceable, functioning cog. They have been cutting on budgets so the tools never work or take forever to implement because TRMS has never been a priority for Amazon as a whole. They keep asking more from the investigators without giving them the tools to be successful. They also have been micromanaging everything. You have to manually keep track of a lot of things that could easily be automated such as clock-in and out times and such. For a tech company you'd think they'd be a step ahead in the game with proper tools."
good,"Most enjoyable thing about my day would be coming into stand up we’re able to hear what going on in amazon world , having a amazing team work makes dream work ."
good,"Working at Amazon was a great experience in terms of gaining experience regarding work life. It gave me a great understanding of what to of what true client centricity is and I use it in my everyday life and not only at work. On a day to day basis I was faced with various different challenges that required some guidance from a more experienced colleague, however everyone was always helpful. The most difficult part of working in the call center was dealing with difficult clients however I always saw this as a learning curve and always used what I had learnt on future situations."
good,"hard hard labor with no recognition nor advancements. the working conditions are horrible, very fast pace, starting pay is very minimal consedering then load of work required"
good,"Picked on cherry picker for most of day"
good,"A man was a decent place to work, helped keep me in shape with all of the walking, I enjoyed being busy, that being said there was a lot of favoritism and the favorite people were not required to work as hard which causes hard workers to work even harder to pick up the slack"
good,Good job easy simple tasks . Many different schedule options. But wait time for approval varies. Company picnic evey year. Great insurance and benefits.
good,"There is plenty to do, never boring. The management could be better but it seems like most of them are childish. Besides that the job is a job and is better than most jobs I've had in the past."
good,"Counting all the products in the warehouse,  people that cared about their jobs and each other.  The hardest part was making the quota each night, learned how to organize a warehouse."
good,"It's good as a ""Get your life together"" I don't recommend it as a career."
good,It was a nice paying relaxed slow paced job. We had a paid training and amazon was the highest paying job that i have had so far i would recommend it to friends.
good,"Amazon, was and still has the potential to be a great company! I loved my job, and had a lot of great times, and fun working there. Day to day we would unload trucks full of products, route packages, sort package, and stage them to be shipped off. This was a very easy, and not so challenging job. I had fun nearly everyday, doing this job. The people were usually nice, and friendly. However, with hundreds of employees and a quick turn around rate, your bound to run into some issues, unless you keep to yourself. The management and staff were great about minimizing problems, and keeping the workers safe. I had many disagreements with production, however, and wasn't in a position to speak up, and even if I was, I would not be compensated for contributions to the company."
good,Best place I ever worked just wished I was able to do more to help customers solve problems some limitations are understandable but the restrictions that are placed on customer service reps is getting to be a bottle neck in the system
good,"We had a meeting and start working right away. Management keeps track of how much you pick every second of the day. They keep track of time off task and can't have more than 10 minutes or they'll question it. At Amazon there's no time for talking, it's all work if you want to make rate for the week."
good,not bad place but night shift nice managment but target was to high and benefits fof people form agency was't good the best thing was we dont need safety shoes
good,"lacking in efficient management of workers.Friendly establishment, with a lot of culture.Training is fast paced and only 1 day to train. Upper management  kind of condescending."
good,Please see my comments in previous window as they are both fair and balanced with no negative bias There is nothing more to add as this is all that I have to report.
good,"If you like to walk a lot, you will like it. If not, look elsewhere. Very fast paced. Plenty of overtime. Repetitive work with little chance of advancement."
good,"Amazon was not a bad place to work, It was fast paced, but there was a lot of support. And it did have its advantages. I would probably work there in the future if I needed to."
good,"Long Hours, pushed very hard. Bonus is nice but no advancement in warehouse. Need to open customer call center or admin offices in US. Stop outsourcing."
good,"The location in which I worked was a very PIT heavy area, 10 hours a day on an order picker standing in place was very hard on the legs and was very uncomfortable. long hours alone in an aisle with only small amounts of human interaction. Surely there were some jobs in the facility that allowed you to move around a little, but overall this facility in particular was a lot of standing."
good,Nice place to work good exercise! Stay safe and follow rules and keep up with your quality and rate and you will have a good job with great business .
good,"my time at amazon consisted of standing in one place picking items form bins for 12 hours a day 3 days a week, then i was promoted to yard specialist, and was underpaid for my level of experience."
good,Not a bad place to work if you can handle the fast paced environment. They put you to high standards. They'll take care of you if standards are exceeded.
good,"they allowed people that never worked in our posrion to dictate the quality of our job position, giving very little room for day to day sometimes hourly problems. "
good,"Very boring! No talking,listening to music and you have to be in at lest the yellow zone to keep your job. Not promised your whole shift for the day and you might have to stay for over 2hrs!"
good,"Les journées peuvent être rude en fonction de notre poste. hors mis ceci il faut vraiment être dynamique car ça demande de la rapidité et du sérieux. "
good,The job is fast paced and high energy at all times. There is always something to do at every moment for ten hours a day with literally no down time. Main focus on quality of work ethic is a big objective for this company.
good,"Working here, I worked 12.5 hours a day at a very fast pace. I intended to work 36 hours a week, but when I got there we constantly had mandatory overtime at a max of 60 hours per week. It was exhausting, but the compensation was nice."
good,el lugar de trabajo esta muy bien y se respira buen rollo
good,"Here at Amazon, training takes place for one week. Great compensation and benefits. Advancement will take a while if your willing to put in the work. Managers are usually easy going Men & Women."
good,"If you would like a laid back and fairly easy job; Amazon is for you. If you want a job were you never advance, Amazon is for you. You can work your tail off, punch the numbers and know all the right people but if you do not do well in the interview portion to move up, you will not even be considered for a high position. Other than that, Amazon is a good company to work for."
good,wonk on a line putting boxes on a pallet i have learned problem solve and tdr and jam clearing and robots the mangers do not act in a timely manner the benefits are good
good,"It seems like an ideal job for a student because it is intended to be extremely flexible. After the first two weeks of training, however, I was hardly able to pick up any shifts and had to resort to finding odd jobs and work elsewhere to cover the expected income I was missing out on. "
good,"they need a little bit more improvement but they are an okay company to work for. I feel they should spend more getting to know their workers, meaning what the weakness and the strengths of every individual."
good,Amaazon Home Services Associates is new to the US and currently the Wincheter site is the only site in the US. The team there was great and has started a lot of good new changes. I was trained to do back up for AHS. A lot of it is just educating the customers on how to do it on their end and helping with system errors. Most of the providers are helpful as well.
good,"As a contractor, you have to be competitive to gain hours. The hours are there but with many drivers, blocks are hard to come by. You have to put in some app time to find blocks, which show up and then disappear in the blink of any eye."
good,"Working here was easy I would say for it to have been my first job. My tasks didn't change and were fairly easy to catch onto. The temperature in the factory was my only issue because I am anemic and it would sometimes get cold in there from the doors constantly being opened, but overall, it was a great start for me to start my work life."
good,"I will always be grateful for my time spent with this amazing company."
good,"C'est un travail assez speed , qui demande beaucoup de courage et d'envie, le personnel est très sympa ainsi que les manager, t'aide et te guide dès que vous demander de l'aide."
good,"Having an houerly rate is very stressful for most people, trying to keep up with demand is difficult, a lot of anxiety goes with working there. Makes you feel like a robot every hour you're clocked in. Feet hurt terribly your first 2 weeks."
good,"I liked the fast paced. The running up and down three floors and from front to back got to be alot. If you were on third floor and al the way   to the back, the walking to break area would cut into your break time."
good,"Fun job! Great to interact with a diverse team of associates. Hours and schedule are a perfect fit for life/work balance. Pay is low although benefits are wonderful! Opportunities are somewhat limited, politics plays a role."
good,"Salary was good but managers dont care to supervise in work they are all watching computers only The thing is  there is a lot of people  who cheating in work and dont follow rules and even when u go to manager and ask can he can do something about it he most of the time will answer   that he is busy right now"
good,Work was physically stressful and demanding. Pack items and tag them. Fast working environment. Hardest part was the physical part of it. Most enjoyable was ac was provided through warehouse.
good,The manger there was racist and I didn’t like that . I was dealing with healthy problems and he keeps writing me up even when I told him about it and it’s unfair .
good,"Very stressful, They monitor you everywhere you go. You have to be in function every 3 minutes. You only get 10 minute breaks and 30 min lunches is not enough for such hard intense labor. You arrive home sore and mentally drained. You can barely make it on your own with this job. Its like a McDonalds job or a Walmart job"
good,I loved working at Amazon. I was let go because my production numbers weren't high enough. I believe those numbers shouldn't be in consideration when there was hardly any work since December and they kept sending people home.
good,"Do your job keep your head down and you will be fine"
good,"standing very long hours, weak gloves were the glue goes through and hands get really messed up. rules are that you are not allowed to pick more than 14kg per box, however, boxes always contained more than that."
good,"Somewhat fun place to work can get boring, can get very repetitive of the job task you do everyday. They mostly care about you getting the desired numbers you want if you could do that than you would be fine."
good,"Usually slow work, which leads to either changing to a schedule that you wouldn't want or forced to leave the position and reapply later. If you're unable to work a schedule, you might need to look for something else or work the schedule. You can't change until it's necessary."
good,"Amazon is a very fast paced environment that allows no room for mistakes what so ever, as much as i loved working there for good pay my efforts were no appreciated and the expectations they set for new employees are ridiculous"
good,"It's a good place to work if you don't mind busting your butt, with a super strict environment. The managers are somewhat efficient, but in my opinion, a lot of them are poorly chosen, and I don't think they were going anywhere anytime soon."
good,"Manual labor, lifting up to 70 lbs, fast paced. Can be super show at times,  lots of VTO = voluntary time off. Peak season can get un safe with boxes every where and pallets everywhere."
good,Typical day was picking orders to prepare for shipment to customers. Most management was horrible depending on your manger. The hardest part was walking 10 hours a day picking on a timely rate.
good,"I started working with this company thinking i will try applying somewhere else while working here but , the initial months were amazing and I got carried away with this and quit looking for any other job."
good,"good place to go to just do work, isolation makes the job boring, music or something would help the time go by a lot smoother. long hours and very fast past."
good,Extremly long hours with minimal suport constanly would reach out for help working 60 hours a week my request went unnoticed. My health started to decline
good,"Here are some examples of amazon management issues in my opinion."
good,"keeping your rate of stow above the minimum is the most difficult part because sometimes you can't get an item to be stowed and then the PA's will be telling you to get your rate up, even though you are above the minimum. also 30mins for lunch is sometimes not enough time and one feels rushed in trying to eat."
good,Will learn a little with fast paced. Culture is nice and had a lot of training. Nice activities nice place to work but Stressful in the same time . have many dinning areas.
good,Very faced paced.  Long hours.  Worked along several great managers.  Great benefits. Learned new things that happens in a fulfillment center. Entailed a lot of physical movement.
good,"Packing is worth 12 dollars.Standing on your feet for 11.5 hours a day,not worth it. Your not able to plan much, because they may say OT at any point."
good,I been working at Amazon for many years years and the best thing about this job is the people that you meet in the job. The work can be stressful somwtimes: management can demand a lot from you. It's also hard to balance work and your life
good,"Amazon is good for someone that is in shape. Walking, standing, bending over does take a toll on you in the long run after you have left. You will have some problems with your ankles and legs."
good,It was a very up tempo work environment to work in. Every thing is a team effort one pace not stressful at all if you up for the task at hand .i loaded an unload equipment from the dock to the trucks in a set motion
good,"If money is all you care about then amazon is gold for you. Otherwise if you're more organised, detail oriented, and more into skill than labor, well retail, customer service or anything other than warehouse is your best bet."
good,It was a easy and physical job. Management took the time to know everyone's name and did what they could to help with any problems employees had. you were always busy which made the 10 hour days go very quick.
good,"Its alright. Just have to be willing to work hard-- if you do, then its for you. Honestly one of the easiest jobs I have ever had; definitely one of the best paying ones."
good,"A average work night at amazon was spending 10 to 12 hours a day stocking/stowing, was very stressful along with overwhelming. I learned to move at a very fast pace."
good,Management sometimes did not practice communication skills but I think that with the help of some of my coworkers everything was cleat enough for me to understand.
good,"a regular day would work , as a stower , putting away items recieved off trucks for future orders.would work 6:30 pm til 5 am I worked Tue-Fri nights , some nights I may work as a water spider this is a position that requires a lot of walking, & basically you provide totes for order pickers & provide carts for stowers, etc."
good,This review is for a warehouse position. Strict policies in work and downtime that include up to 15 minutes of idle time. Some managers are amazing and some are worse than others. Mandatory overtime is frequent especially around the holidays. Two 30 minute breaks a day and a lot of walking/standing.
good,"I am ready to hard work and Challenge."
good,"pay is great! its only that your feet hurt everyday and u stay on feet the entire 10 hours, and its a huge warehouse so u walk a lot everywhere, small break times only get 2 breaks that are about 5-8 minutes only, the rest of break u have to walk to and from workstation."
good,Just be prepared to be on your feet all day. Also you won’t have to many breaks. You will enjoy all of the other employees. Everyone is on the same page.
good,Working with Amazon is not a hard job at all but its really what you make it i deliver on-time by choosing the best routes. Loading all the packages in the car and if you do not make it where its easy for you the find the packages quickly the job becomes stressful
good,Working hard standing long hours great people to work with. Great hours at the work location people who care about there job always on time with a smile on there face.
good,"RDU5 Amazon Fulfillment Center can be an exciting place to work as it pertains to being fast paced, flexible shifts, and diversity. However, management and the PA's are less than professional. There is a lot of favoritism when it comes down to being cross trained, assigned daily task, and receiving swag bucks."
good,"- Typical day consist of 10 hours shift with reasonable distributed breaks."
good,"Your lucky to work 4 to 24 hours a week. Managment changes things alot, they hired way to many people, more than they need. Culture is amazing ive worked with great people, met great people. It's hard to get hours sometimes you won't work for a week and your not on a set schedule, so first come first serve to pick up hours. Hardest part is getting hours if your looking for a part-time job and want a steady schedule i wouldn't recommend Prime Now, If it's the bigger FC's yes your guarantee hours but with the smaller ones you aren't."
good,"Amazon distribution warehouses are a good place to work if you are bored, decently muscular, and not looking for a living income. They only offer part-time work and often send people home early so the weekly wage is extremely variable. Workplace culture and management are all very friendly and helpful but it really seems like no one knows whats going on at any given moment. "
good,"I'm a current worker for Amazon through pmp recruitment and do the outbound on the packing side of things... basically the targets they expect you to reach per hour are ridiculous, they also force overtime on you and an extra hour early because of peak time.. not good if you have a family, the managers are alright to get on with and I've not really come across anybody that isn't decent you just get constantly harassed if you don't hit your targets, and if you can't stand for long periods of time then don't go for this job you have to be physically fit to work here, pays OK I guess, could be better but at least you get free tea and coffee and sometimes they give you sweets and biscuits on your break which is a bonus, all in all not to bad but something to consider about other jobs long term if you've got kids, good for short term money in my opinion."
good,A lot of hard work and emphasis on making deadlines but rewarding and the people are great to work with. Room for growth but a lot of typical corporate stuff necessary before that happens.
good,"I go into work at 6 pm and i don't get home until 6 am. My work week starts Wednesday night and ends Sunday morning. This may not seem like much but with the physical and mental activity that you endure throughout your night you just cant survive one less then 6 hours of sleep and even that is pushing it. It is very hard to spend time with your family while trying to fit sleep in. This company has so much potential, the benefits are AMAZING the pay could be better, the people you encounter here are an amazing bunch (on all shifts from what i understand). This temporary position could become a career if there were more options that cater to families. Unfortunately this inst the case, even as a manager you'd think they'd cut you some slack but they work 14 hour days and are on salary, so they may get paid more but if you break it all down some of them make as much as the workers."
good,"Easy work, motivating, lots of benefits, flexible. The HR team was really frustrating to work with but they were overall helpful. There are really long hours to work but only a few days a week."
good,Hardest part is standing for 10 hours while lifting heavy boxes but besides that the work is simple and computer instructions are clear. There are plenty people there to help with any trouble or confusion. Great benefits and okay pay rate.
good,The job role itself at Amazon is fantastic and for what you are paid it’s great. Unfortunately the company is based on let’s go with the flow environment and attitude no structure or discipline to the environment or the goals of the business. The HR department are awful especially for engineers you are constantly told to ring a helpline other than having your issue resolved there and then. 90% of the time I felt as though we was made to forget the meaning of team.
good,"Working at Amazon for three years has taught me how to work with all types of individuals and personalties . A typical day at amazon is busy and fast pace but throughout the day the Leadership team walks around and hands out ""amazon dollars"" which is rewarding as they notice I'm doing a good job. The hardest part about this job is the physical labor required which is to walk 10 to 12 miles daily. Most enjoyable part of this job is the satisfaction when sending out 300,000 packages successfully and assuring that customers are getting what they paid for by receiving their products on time."
good,"All in All, Amazon is a great job, There are good benefits, paid time off, stocks, 401k plans, everything you can think of... Managers don't have time to give you 1 on 1 time and you are fast paced trained... They tell you the basics and then throw you in with everyone else and expect you to come out on top, and if you don't, the higher ups will have problems with you."
good,Since i have started the load of work nearly doubled. there is plenty of internal silly rules. Amazon do not take care about their drivers at all. In other hand it is flexible and you can survive
good,"Overall the work was fairly easy. The pay was great especially with overtime hours. Other employees were easy to work with, and the management was decent."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Amazon, but they really work you like a machine which was what I really didn't like. On a typical day I would pick items from a shelf and sort them into bins to be sent out to buyers. I also had a second position called Amnesty. I would work that 2 days a week and it involved keeping the floor clean and helping problem solve station/computer problems. The workplace culture was a little competitive, we were rated on who was picking items the fastest, the fastest getting rewards. We weren't allowed to talk while working because we would be timed and in a separate station. No phones or music either.  Two half hour breaks a day, one paid one not. The most enjoyable part was I had a really nice manager that I got along with great and I made good friends, and every once in awhile the mundane tasks were relaxing."
good,"Long hours standing on your feet"
good,"There is definitely pressure to keep your rate up and quality up to standard. Pay attention to avoid mistakes because once an item is stored into the system, there is no going back."
good,"long work days, 4 days consecutive 3 days off. Very friendly environment. Needs more training assist. Second work day, they put you on your own. Manager make you compete with one another but ends up being unfair. Can easily be discouraged if your numbers are not met."
good,It is a good job but not always flexible enough to accomidate for school. Also the employees are often unhappy. as management changes a lot employees are often in conflict with the managers.
good,"The job entails you to work a 10 hour shift, 4 days a week. Graveyard and Morning shifts available. The work environment is fast pace and promotions are available after the 90 probation is complete. Management does a good job in review the work load for the day and for all shifts. Communications is a must and safety is emphasized everyday. The hardest part about the job is keeping up with the rating system. But if your work is consistent and manageable, keeping rate is easy."
good,Most positions are fast paced and physically challenging in the warehouse. Pay and time off are great though.  Pay raises are fair although advancement is challenging.
good,"While a job that is more than likely secure for you, as Amazon is still growing, it is very fast paced and busy at times. You may like it if you prefer easy, but physically demanding work. However, I've seen that half of the workers there take their time getting the work done."
good,"I enjoy the physical work, but it is repetitive work. It is good when you get rotated to do different positions. But when you get stuck in the same position and management fails to rotate you because you do really good there, it gets hard on your body. Its also kind of backwards, if you work hard and do well they keep you in that spot, if you talk and get bad numbers they move you to the better positions, like problem solving, vendor returns. Management has a high turn over, which makes it bumpy"
good,If you work hard advancement opportunities exist in may areas.  Being a global company there  are many avenues to pursue for one who wants to advance.
good,"Inicio das atividades as o6:00 da manhã sem rota fixa e sem quantidade de clientes fixos devendo retornar após á última entrega indepedente do horário."
good,Good pay but hard on your body short breaks and ad management. You are supposed to stay hydrated but they complain about too many bathroom breaks. But Amazon has great benifit only good thing about this job.
good,"Although it is not said publicly, the amount of work given to us by the company means we have to work at least 50-60 hours a week to complete the tasks, while contract stated 40"
good,"Working as an Amazon Fresh warehouse associate was fun but also draining. My hours were overnight and there was a lot a walking. I worked in various climates to get the job done. Working at Amazon, I met so many amazing people of all different backgrounds. I think managment could've been a little bit better. It wasn't as strong as it could have been."
good,Great place to work Amazon does take care of their emploryees. You can make history. If you have an opinion and may want to change something to make it easier for other employees they will accommodate....
good,Great place to work. Attendance very important. Please by all means. Friendly people to work with. Has air conditioning. Great benefits. You can move up in the company.
good,Stowing was easy but it was kinda hard keeping your rate up when you can't put big items in certain stop or the receivers don't put the right amount of items in yur container
good,"Good place to work with knowledgeable leaders."
good,Work hard every time and make history. You will have lots of work in every quarter. You need to be involved in work every time and forget about holidays.
good,"A typical day at amazon was easy and self paced. It was a great place to work, but the management wasn't very well. The hardest part of the job were the small breaks. The most enjoyable part were the employee appreciation gifts and incentives."
good,Although it has been some time since I've worked at Amazon it's safe to say a warehouse as big as that sticks into your memory. Loaded with just about anything imaginable you'll find yourself seeing at least one thing a day that you would have never known existed.
good,"Great pay, stressful environment. Working 50 hours+ per week has become the norm, not great work/life balance. Overall I would recommend working here but with some hesitation."
good,"Scanned products into computer, unload trucks, held meeting about work, safety, production, and any other issues during the work day. Sorted product boxes from small to large, light to heavy. Very good teamwork"
good,"I started working for Amazon when they built a new fulfillment center. And honestly I must say I was disappointed. Like many jobs that aren't so great and employ a mass number of people all at once, they make it seem greater than it is. Everyone (including management and HR) were all new. This resulted in promises being made and not followed through with, as well as inconsistency in policy enforcement. A normal day could be simplified to a very minimum list. Clock In, Stand Up, Work, Break, Work, Clock out. Things ran differently depending on what manager is working but overall I cant complain about them. I worked here for 8 months and the only things that motivated me to stay was a handful of my coworkers (not including management), the pay, and the hours. The environment is very fast paced and the turn over rate isn't as crazy as you would think, but the quick pace can become exhausting very quickly, mentally, emotionally, and physically. Overall, I would consider working here again, but a tip."
good,I enjoyed working in this fast paced laid back warehouse. benefits were awesome!!  too bad they mostly hire seasonal for peak seasons.I may return for another season one day later in life
good,i would clock in at 6pm and i had about 2 hour breaks for lunch and break. I would be sorting out parcels and putting them onto pallets and shrink wrapping them.
good,"great people and a great place to work, face pace which I like and a lot of overtime benefits r great but advancing and pay raise aren't great I loved Amazon and the people but management is another story"
good,"Long hours,  safety is  concern,  management is all about productivity, pushing associates to make their numbers and not worried about their safety.  I did enjoy meeting a lot of different people."
good,"You lift frequently, a lot of grabbing, grasping and handling at a high speed. Rate is required in order to keep employment, which will vary by department and role."
good,"working at amazon wasn't too bad. Looking past the constant pain, the few very mean coworkers, and break rooms that were way too far for the short breaks we had, it was pretty okay. They played music for the entire shift and trolled people who complained on the music choice. It wouldn't be unknown that they would play children music and super mario theme music on repeat for hours on end, when someone did complain.Working there gave me some funny stories."
good,The warehouse positions require much physical labor with steady production rate increases.  Depending on work flow you may be subject to voluntary unpaid time off.
good,"A lot of focus on controls and improvements in the process , the leadership team was keen to understand and work on improvements and lot of visibility to understand the business."
good,"Amazon. Inc is a hardworking environment that is very customer oriented. Allows for personal time, company time and vacation time to be taken at any time with notice. Human Resources have trouble solving disputes of both big and small. Management has been known to put workers in areas that they have trouble succeeding in."
good,"A interesting company, BUT definitely have problems & won't change them!! Only one inbound manager, Daytime female, wears glasses, SHE HAS A OPEN MIND! Open to my ideas when I was there!"
good,"emphasis on production/shipping, fair pay with bonus incentives, ample responsibilities ,poor training plan, difficult communications proceedures,overnight shifts required during holiday season"
good,Amazon allows for advancement opportunities and they promote fast. As long as you work hard and meet rates. Lots of mandatory over time. Plan on being away from home a lot and being tired when you are home.
good,"Work is better operating a machine and not working in the aisles. If you get hired, they have good benefits and pay, amazing benefits but should be greatly qualified."
good,"You work 10 hour days for 4 days a week with mandatory overtime during peak season. Tough, but they give you hours and benefits right away. They take a commitment on you, but its a commitment on your work/life balance."
good,I loved the security of the job but the staff at my center just weren't the best they could be. The need to help workers keep a good attitude. a lot of them negative.
good,learn as you go type of place. always have issues with staffing needs in the wareshouse. Managers always try to take care of the staff with lunch's try to keep the place great.
good,"amazon is a great company to work for, however be ready to work hard. They have others ready to take your place at any moment. You need the benefits because its a lot of physical work which I got things falling on me, and lots of big items that pinched my back even with proper lifting. Fun yet very physical."
good,"A typical day at work starts with meeting up with your crew after clocking and after an update about the workplace we stretch, go through a pep talk, and then get assigned our station and begin working. After every 2 hours and 15 mins we get a 15 min break then after 5 hrs pass we go to lunch for 30 mins. After 10 hrs of working we turn off our stations and clock out for the day. What area I'm assigned to is STOW, which is just putting away items and scanning them to bins. This is what we do on the floors 2 - 4 and half of the crew we are assigned with does this on the 1st floor. The half that doesn't STOW takes the items that where put on carts (after coming off a truck) and delivers them to other sides of the building and load them on elevators sending the items to other floors. After awhile I became an ambassador (trainer) and I trained, supervised, interacted, and help out any new employees who were also assigned to STOW. We it came to STOW we had to put away many items per minute (for the entire day at least 3200 items stowed away) which after adapting to the job is pretty simple. Other than that with management they push you to work faster if they see any kind of decline in your work; also are mainly there to assign your work and motivate you to push harder to increase numbers. Also with the length and how huge the fulfillment center is, having a 30 min lunch with a 5 min walk time to get to the break room and from the break room, being able to eat lunch was either difficult with the amount of so many people or we had to rush to eat which wasn't at all great. Unless some"
good,it is a grate place to work they just don't care about personal problems. the pay is grate and the benefit's are good you will get all the training that u will ever need it there for you
good,"All the job functions are easy to learn and my take time to get us to however; it is a labor intensive environment with exciting amounts of walking, lifting and bending at the back and knees."
good,Nada que desabone enquanto estive por lá algumas lideranças saíam em desacordo sempre vendo o lado da empresa contratante e nada dos motoristas e ajudantes
good,"Work of organization and some people's negative attitude will not be accepted rules that apply to agency employees generally work interesting, but difficult because of the reach quickly Personally target"
good,It was a easy going job.  Expected employees to make rate in the particular area you were assigned.  Everything was pretty much fast paced and the people were down to earth.
good,"Working at Amazon was very fast paced, given the fact that it had just opened in the Joliet area. However, during the orientation, the description of what the job entailed was quite different once we all started. There was constant equipment failure in the department where we had to receive and sort products at a fast pace, and we were all rated on our speed. This was whether the equipment was failing or not. This would have been a good job because of the great benefits, but those issues made it difficult, and some of the supervisors treated workers unfairly."
good,"Well, The place to work seems to be great.Working in different teams here is a plus.Gets you more coverage of amazon products and your visibility.Productivity mattters."
good,Fun place to work with good benefits. A bit stressful day to day due to strict and demanding job functions depending on where you're working but all in all a fun and productive place to work.
good,"its not as bad as the online reviews say, if you work hard and are able to stay on task you will have no problem making rate. Amazon has been the most stable place i have worked as far as set hours and ok pay."
good,Working in a call center is difficult.  I did this for 6 years and you're literally tied to your head set.  Timed when you went to the bathroom.  When I began working from home it was much more relaxed.
good,"The company work in shifts. You will have a rotational shift so you need to adjust yourself working in different hours in a day. Work culture is really nice. We have lots of fun during post peak parties or during team-outings. Work pressure is dependent on the amount of work we have for the day. Amazon is very particular about breaks, so you can't take more than an hour break in a day divided in 30 mins."
good,"The Amazon in itself is a brand , but work culture varies from team to team ."
good,Amazon was a decent company to work for. I wish they would care more about the employees. I did enjoy working from home and wouldn't mind a similar position.
good,"packing shipments and placing it on the belt"
good,"Around the holidays fun and fast pace, however it'll get slower as the summer comes, I learned the history, and operations of Amazon, the management was terrible, though there were a few good people I met, the workplace culture is diverse, the hardest part working alone for 10 hours not getting errors, the enjoyable part was the experience, and the employees."
good,"WORKING HARD GETS YOU NOW WHERE "
good,"A typical work day started out coming in and stretching, then hearing the stats of the previous day and expectation for the day. Learned how to do multiple things."
good,"Great benefits if your through the company, will pay 95% of your schooling, the pay is good but the hours are pretty long if your a full time college student."
good,"Benefits are good, if you like to be active and work under a deadline this might be for you!  It is stressful at times but the three day weekends are nice."
good,Great company to work for with great health and work benefits.  The management and staff are wonderful reliable employees. The culture is phenomenal. I enjoyed working at Amazon because of the customers and staff which are more like a close wonderful reliable family.
good,"Not a bad company to work for if you don't mind warehouse work. The people are friendly and they care about their employees. The benefits are on par with other companies, and the hourly pay is reasonable."
good,Cette entreprise met tout en oeuvre pour que les personnes qui y travaillent ce sentent bien malgré le rythme de travail très soutenu et les quotas qui sont très compliqués à atteindre.
good,"Great pay and flexible hours and friendly co workers equal opportunity for everyone I enjoyed Amazon u"
good,"Stretching before a 10 hour shift was always mandatory with a little pep session that the supervisors would give. Depending on which department you are set in, you have different obligations."
good,"I worked at Amazon for a short period of time and much of my opinion comes from speaking to other staff as well as taking part in induction, listening to the spiel, etc."
good,has potential too grow as a great company i had the early morning shift it was great shift met many friends there unfortunately i could not get my badge converted
good,The work is not stressful. It is a great place to start your career at. You have a bunch of internal transfer opportunities.
good,Was an overall great place to work just long night and a far commute. Management where nice and always try to help if needed.
good,"It was good working there , it had its benefits. Staff made you feel at home and if you had any concerns HR was sure to help you . Overall working there, co-workers were friendly"
good,"Amazon is a great place to work. It's a nice open environment and they treat you great. It's a very big warehouse, lots of diversity. And they pay good"
good,"Indeed a hard place to work. Its a very physically demanding job. If you get over the exhaustion of the job, noise and dirt in your first week you'll do fine overall. Its a very welcoming place, no mater where you're from you'll fit in just right."
good,Good place to work with opportunities to learn and work in n different departments. Strong safety matters onsite amcare
good,"At the beginning of my employment I loved it. But after about a week I noticed the management tells certain people that they like that they can tell other people what to do even though they aren't qualified, resulting in them reporting things that aren't true just because they don't like somebody. Also the managers are just rude and disrespectful to anybody that isn't an amazon employee. Also they don't care how productive you are if you don't do what they decide is right."
good,"The harder you work the better. Some times it can Be frustrating but it's worth the pay . It's an other night position and you only work 3 days . The only thing is everything is through computer or telephone, you're never talking to anyone directly"
good,"Real smooth work place, easy going and fast paced, very understandable and can catch on easy. Management was not too bad could have been more organized and respectful."
good,"Worst job I've ever had , don't recommend this job to no one . Pay was good but they didn't calculate right and checks were short constantly, unprofessional in some areas and they lie to save they're behind ."
good,Amazon was a very simple job to accomplish the management was terrible and the coworkers were nice and kind. I wouldn't mind working for this company again.
good,"If you dont mind mindless work, this job is for you. As long as you work hard and meet your production rate you will accel at this place"
good,"-You definitely want to apply between July or August"
good,"Making up customer orders, using hand held remote scanners to locate various items to prepare them for shipment.  Working in a very busy warehouse environment."
good,"The work is relatively easy, the benefits are great, but the personal culture is not very good. to management you are just an employee number in the computer, and to the other workers you are a unneeded distraction. more often then not your co-workers did not care about their job, passing on broken or damaged items, not following correct procedure in order to keep form actually doing the work. "
good,They have complete benefits. Very nice place to work but some of the crew are racist. They give heavy work to those they dont know and they give less work to their friends
good,"long days,weekend shifts everyone is very friendly enjoyed working here but shifts were clashing with seeing my children due to me leaving"
good,Amazon gives you the opportunity to deliver results within a very short span of time. The organisation also allows you to own the project as a whole.
good,"Amazon  was  a cool  job ,difficult  at  first but  it turned  out to  be fun and I  enjoyed  my  work schedule  after  all  and. I. Wish. To. Go  back"
good,Amazon gives you the opportunity to develop your skills with opportunities throughout the company.  Fulfillment Centers are a fast paced environment with a diversity with co-workers.
good,"Good pay, they want all your time however. They make it where during the holidays you're not allowed to have a life outside of amazon. They do occasionally pay for holiday meals and they give you adequate time off"
good,"With its state of the art fulfillment technology, no doubt it will be a pioneer / leader but on the other hand. it offers only a limited possibility to learn and grow in this ecosystem"
good,The part of the Job is the way how you have to pack the stuff in the pods in which theirs no space and to keep you rate up to point when all you had is big items
good,it's a decent place to work they are good to there employees the work hours are long but not too bad. hr is very helpful there. the pa's and the managers are nice as well.
good,"L'entreprise en elle même est tres serieuse. Il y a beaucoup de règles à assimiler assé vite."
good,The management regulations was not up to date  in the department I moved into. The job was a great experience for me. The most enjoyable part the job consisted was working in the warehouse. A typical day was a productive day.
good,At first it was a great place to work. I was a seasonal employee. If you have back problems I highly don't recommend this type of work. The staff doesn't communicate very well. I didn't know I still had to do hours after the seasonal work was over so they fired me and said I quit for not showing up. HR didn't do anything about it and just screwed me out of a job.
good,"work as part of team sorting, picking, packing, scanning and loading items for delivery in a very fast. the work is challenging but fun"
good,"A very stable job with excellent compensation and benefits. However, poor communication from management and nothing management says is promised. Also, there is NO work life balance. Amazon will become your life."
good,"Awesome workplace ..The experience was funny, enjoyed working in the Amazon environment ..People are friendly..I can't really say anything  negative about Amazon"
good,"There's always something to do at Amazon and always someone willing to help you out. It's a fun environment to work in, but management could be better."
good,"long hours, always working never have down time. Great place to keep busy. Work 10 hours a day for four days with three days off. Great place to meet new people and get along with men and women"
good,all day receive goods. nice management and co-workers. the hardest part of the job was order picking in my opinion. The most enjoyable part of the job it's receiving
good,I clock in and walk to the stand up area. I wait for managers to get there and leave stand up with work information while they leave stretches. After stand up we go straight to work and pick orders that the RF gun is giving up.
good,"I was lucky enough to get a job as a Gift Wrap Associate, one of the easiest jobs available. Amazon gets a bad rep because of the long hours, but depending on what job you end up with its typicaly not a hard job. However, I didn't like how the people of authority treated the temporary employees like myself. Ive heard , and seen many petty instances. That's the only issue I have with the company, the disregard they have for people and their feelings. Also everytime I would ask someone a question, no one knew the answer, they'd always send me off to someone else."
good,if you are not liked the do everything they can to get you out.  What I mean by liked is being friendly with management they dont care how much you are willing to do if you dont kiss up
good,"Amazon offers much but they expect more.   You work four ten hour days but keep in mind they can call overtime anytime 24 hours before  the last day of your shift.  "
good,"Amazon was a good company to work for in the compensation aspect although the lack of work did not equal out and the end of the pay period.  The company seemed to always have too many employees assigned to work (figuring so many would not show), then they would have to ask for voluntaries to go home.  If enough people then did not volunteer the work load would not sustain everyone.  You were not busy for most of the 10 hours shift, therefore, it was not a very satisfying position."
good,"i have learned that working at amazon , there must be a smile. Each day you walk into something that is always a MUST to change."
good,"Some people genuinely enjoyed working there. It is a culture where learning and ownership is highly encouraged, but emotions and personal connections are restrained."
good,Very Fast Paced Environment and Plenty of Work to do. Amazon is a very demanding place and also an important business that helps consumers shop and buy online
good,this job was fun and had friendly people and fun to get to know.Also it was hard work but learning new things was pretty exciting.
good,"Come prepared to work in stand for your entire shift . Look forward to meeting and working with great people. There""s room for growth and every area of the warehouse.Management try to be there for whatever the situation maybe."
good,"Challenging work environment that is great at developing employees. Very long hours, difficult to balance work and personal life. It is very rewarding to see your hard work produce great results."
good,"Hardworking"
good,On your feet for 10 to 11 hours with only a 30 min break. They did not want you to stop for any reasons. I feel like for the amount of work people put in they should get a lot more from the company because they deserve it.
good,overall my experience there was not bad at all. Only thing is very fast working environment. I only wish I did not start around the holiday season.
good,"Its worth it for the pay, but they work you hard to earn it. I clock in go to stand-up then to work for 2 and a half hours and 15 minute break after that back to it for 2 more hours than 30 min lunch after that stand-up again to stretch then back to work for 2 in a half more hours than another 15 min break till time to get off. Your bathroom break is included with the breaks. If your looking to loose exercise its the perfect place to go."
good,"I would report to the stand up floor at the beginning of the shift to see what station or floor I would be working on. If at a station, I would pick items and place in totes. If at a floor I would take totes off the line and place on the conveyor belt."
good,the typical work days was long and boring. learned how to use a scanner and pallet jack. The management wasn't to good you go to one manger they tell you this you go to another manger they tell you different . the co-workers was nit all one bored. the hardest part of the job is lifting heavy boxes as a woman by myself. the most enjoyable part of the job is peak season they had music playing. also we only had a 30 minute lunch on a 10 hour job.
good,"As a picker , I had to collect goods ordered on the scanner ."
good,"Pays the bills, room for growth but only if your willing to be the managers favorite. A lot of favoritism at this job. Vacation and paid time is very low. They have too many blackout dates or reasons why you can not use your accumulated hours."
good,I worked at Amazon warehouse but with ISS temp agency and it was a okay lifestyle for awhile but then it gotten to hard for me to handle and waking up in the morning. Then i started to do night shift. And i worked wednesday - saturday and i called off friday and saturday for my own personal needs and then when i came try clocking in the following week my badge wasnt working. They terminated me for not coming in Friday and saturday but they clearly saw that i called off.
good,"A workplace without dress code, believing in the quality of the  work and not on the dress. Lots of opportunity to learn and experiment, with customer at the pinnacle of every thought and activity."
good,"Its okay, salaries are less but overall its okay to work for Amazon."
good,A typical day at Amazon for me was scanning items and putting them into a pod. I enjoyed working with the employess on my shift.
good,they need to open full time positions. you can learn different positions and move around and learn all the in's and out's of working there.
good,For a normal day of work in amazon i would walk the mods and pick and that meant doing a lot of walking at least 8 miles a day. I did learn how to use a scan gun and how to solve simple problems on the gun.The management was good and they  were all interactive with the employees. The co workers in the warehouse were mostly tired from having to work the long hours. The hardest part of the job was having to walk non stop picking the orders. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing what kind of items customers would purchase.
good,The co-workers at Amazon are what keeps you going every day it can be very stressful. Working at Amazon you should just forget about having any type of life out side of work although they do have great benefits.
good,"It was a heavy job, lifting boxes and there was pressure to rush to the next pick. It was a short term contract up to Christmas but work was offered in the New Year.  I decided not to take it as I was coming to the UK, for better choice of work, better pay and "
good,"I worked at Amazon, in the mid to late 1990's. So, it was a very different place, as was, the city of Seattle. It's not the Amazon, y'all know today.  During my employment with the Empire, it was a diverse melting pot, of Seattle's counter culture. The days were long, (10 hours), but, everyone for the most part, enjoyed what they did, and knew the benefits would pay off one day."
good,My day consist of walking anywhere from 15 to 20 miles easy. I learned that you can walk this distance daily. Management does what they can to help however they will not move you to train in another area unless you are meeting rate in your own area. I thought that was silly because everyone is not good at doing the same thing. The people there are very friendly and I enjoy meeting and talking to different staff.
good,"My typical day was busy and pretty fast paced.  I could preform every task within my department well enough to consistently make rate and train others, so my manager used me as a floater and trainer a lot, based on business demands."
good,"I Work as Help Desk Executive all the mail update as per the employee request , arrange the cab for login and logout and now i am handling Special Booking arrange cabs on Disposal, Events, Team Lunch, airport drop etc."
good,I have been trained to move in the  direction to become an supervisor. with dedication and hard work I became an ambassador( trainer) and a process guide ( supervisor assistant). The shift is 10 hours with great benefits. but as a single mother the long hours can be challenging. I do love the work environment and the diversity. everyone is willing to help and have a cheerful disposition. You will always be greeted with a smile but answered with stern and precise answers. For all new comers it will be hard your first few months getting into the swing of working long hours and using muscles you haven't used in a while or maybe never. There is always room to grow and many things to learn. Besides the people I work with pay help as well..
good,"I have been working at Amazon.com full-time.think big, and create something new. Competitive salary and benefits with other major tech companies. 100% self motivating work environment. No dress code and 4 legged friends are welcome."
good,"I liked everything about the job, except for the misunderstanding about my being laid off. At first, they told me there was a schedule change and when it came down to it I later found out I'd been laid off. They told me I could reapply around the 6th and I'd tried to and there were complications."
good,I just started at Amazon it is alot of hard work and you definately get your exercise but I feel they should not be that hard on people about their percentage.
good,"Working nightshift is tough but you get on with it and work, it's not like what everyone says about it, how it's badly run and get treated bad. "
good,"Taught many things like to be patient,how to represent yourself,leadership principles etc."
good,"Pros - Good Pay, Set Schedule, and relatively easy to advance"
good,"Everyone wants to sell on Amazon already, it's where people start shopping. The role being a ""sales role"" didn't have any sales talent necessary to hit goals. The role was very data driven to ensure that sellers on the platform sold and had great products. If you are good at excel you'll love this role."
good,"The job offers great compensation and great benefits. Although it could be better if we the employees of Amazon, were provided with better people in charge as far as the managers. Most of the managers do not have managers or any leadership experience. Most of the managers do not know how to communicate with their fellow employees, and most of them do not know how to make great decisions when put in bad situations; they make a lot of bad calls. The managers there make Amazon look very bad, and they make the employees not want to work there."
good,"loved my job!"
good,A typical work day starts with arranging the associates to appropriate places and work in the system that everything goes through computer. Gained a lot of managerial skills and problem solving. Learned how to use timely decisions and deep dive on problems that arrise on the shift to explain them to senior managment. The most enjoyable part of the work is that I can work with the people and motivate them to come to work and develop them into a new key roles.
good,"Not a great career if you have a partner and you work on night shift. Work 40 - 60 hours a week. Work 4 and off 3. Company has strict policies even for day 1 associates. Lack of communication from upper management."
good,This is a good place to gain quick money over holidays summer time or christmast time. but you have no time for your self as in peak Times you work 5 days for 11 hours
good,"Atypical day at work would be arriving on time to start your day"
good,"As the logo of Amazon states 'Work hard, have fun' we do follow the moto. We work hard when we need to meet the demand. If the demand is met and we have free time we do some fun activities."
good,ok place to work would of been more better if i had more hours and a better shift.The people besides the managers and supervisors my coworkers were all cool.
good,"need more stability in several departments and areas of the facility!"
good,"Althought the days work at Amazon were long and the back to back shifts were exhausting, i always found myself feeling forfilled at the end of the day. The management were fantastic and i was able to meet amazing people and see the sights of Amazon too."
good,outstanding Company to work for I think. Co-workers were cool to work with I learned some much about the company. Work wasn't as hard and Management was petty good. I enjoyed coming to work each day.
good,It was a seasonal position so it was ok for the time. they dont hire too often but it was temporary. co workers were nice but management was disorganized.
good,"A typical day at work is a busy day, having so many calls incoming from our customers from different side of the country and world. I have learned and developed my communication skills, multi tasking capabilities and grown professionally. The workplace can be described as one of the friendliest basing on the nature of the job, everyone in our company is approachable though the level of competence is very high. The hardest part of my job there was the trial and error part, when you think that you have planned everything well so that you will achieve the expected outcome and then there was a detail that you realize that is more complicated than what you think, in the end, the plan was not yet perfect and I need to draft another plan. Luckily, the company is considerate and let us do our job with all the help that we need that is why I am enjoying my job."
good,Very secure job but 10 hour days can be very tiring. Great benefits. Fun workplace and great way to meet a multitude of people.
good,"Main responsibilities:"
good,Amazon allowed me to received experience in multiple warehousing positions as well as obtaining licences to operate machinery. I enjoyed working for Amazon due to the fact that it gave me work experience that fit my major.
good,"hardest part of the job is the hours."
good,"- Weinig te doen"
good,"Piking about 1.500 itens per shift, whitout errors."
good,"I've always found Amazon's perpetual startup atmosphere exciting, and I've gone back whenever I could. As a contractor, Amazon employees enjoy a decent life/work balance and moderate pay for Seattle. Full-time Amazon employees give up that life/work balance, accepting the fact of being on-call 24/7 in return for job security and the possibility of advancement. Amazon rewards energy, enthusiasm, and ideas, but you also have to find a team that you fit into, as the interview process gives everyone on said team the chance to shoot you down. But that's probably part of what gives Amazon's team culture its cohesive, start-up dynamism and spark. Given the chance, I'd love to break into that obsessive 24/7 blue-badge world, myself ..."
good,Ok job and pays great but too much work and too many hours. Nice people and manger help out. They have night shifts.
good,Long hours of walking and lifting. There were many great and friendly people. The hardest part of my job were the physical demands.
good,a typical day at work was always busy and fast paste. i learned better behavior and how to take instructions well.
good,"i was a great job, made great freinds but not great freinds with the higher workers."
good,"The company provides things for it's employees most other companies don't free of charge. Such as gatorade, aspirin. bio freeze, feminine products. The actual Managers of Amazon it's self are fair and care for their employees, but the staff management group that it uses to recruit people does not. They are rude and bias"
good,Its a lot of hard work and always busy. Management always seems to contradict each other. Very little room for advancemt. A lot of favoratism.
good,"A typical day involved collecting products to fill orders from areas that typically were 100 yds by 50 yds. Management ranged from being affable to overbearing. Coworkers were generally pleasant and great to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was not being confined to one location and being able to move from one area to another to complete assignments."
good,"Pick customer orders on all levels of a multi-level mezzanine, pack and ship orders, and troubleshoot problems to resolution. Operate all powered equipment such as forklift and cherry picker. Adhere to all aspects of production; and adhere to strict safety, quality, and production standards"
good,Having a productive day working between 8-10 hours a day. I learned how to handle different type of materials in warehouse. My management team are fun to be around and are also great leaders. The hardest part of my job is fighting the urge of sleepiness. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with my co-workers.
good,"everyday at work was fun."
good,it was a ok job but wasn't gareenteed 40 hours a week it was very fast pace that I loked
good,It was a great job. I learn how to stock the shelves. The hardest part about the job was the hours. I go to school and its hard working at Amazon and going to school. I enjoy the money part.
good,"This was a temporary job. The building was full of fun activities, including a X-Box Connect and a fooz-ball table. The employees were fun loving and management was genuinely interested in helping their employees succeed. Upper management listens to their employees. The hardest part was telling customers that their items would not arrive on time because I really wanted to make sure that everyone received everything that they wanted. The facilities were very clean."
good,"Amazon is my first IT job. I have learned a lot within the past 2 years with this company. A typical work day for me involves coming into work and checking the ticket queue for any unassigned (newly arrived) tickets then seeing what my co-workers are handing off from the shift before. After this, I start working on my daily task such as performing daily RF scanner audits, MDF security checks, check for any needed RMA items, clean collate printers, and walking around to see if there is anything needed on the production floor. "
good,"I started as a packer, after a month or so more opportunities started to head my way. I learnt a process called Re-bin where you are give a tote of items, you scan an item and it tells you where to put the slot so the packers can pack it. I was also pick trained and I started gaining more responsibilities. It was a great feeling to meet a deadline. "
good,Your given the opportunity to learn how to operate forklifts and gain knowledge and experience throughout the warehouse but the management sucks. They are very inexperienced.
good,"co-workers are friendly"
good,"A typical day at work involved standing in ones designated station, processing items, while trying to reach productivity. I learned to keep a steady pace, not working too hard, while at the same time not slacking off. Always clean as you go, and show respect to co-workers. The hardest part of the job was the long hours on your feet. The most enjoyable part of the job was having fun while working. We had music to listen to and someone close by to help if we had any difficulties."
good,i loved working at amazon.com i never knew what the day was going to hold. I loved the people that i worked with. The only thing about this is during winter hours you can pull up to 60 hours a week.
good,"The work is steady and can have its slow days and its busy days, you start on a temporary contract and can be given a permnant contract"
good,a typical day consist of solving problem within the warehouse.Enjoyed my co-workers and management.
good,A typical day day at Amazon consist of walking for long periods of time while pushing carts and picking items off of shelves or standing in one area packing inventory into boxes for shipping. Management is extremely hands on and helpful. The hardest part of the job is staying consistante throughout the day but the most enjoyable part is being able to meet a wide variety of people.
good,answered incoming call from customers. determined the nature and resolution of the customer issues and questions.
good,"Amazon is okay, its not the best job. You aren't ever really guaranteed a job there. If your season ends and you don't get hired on full-time then you get let go. The people there are pretty cool though."
good,Alot of work and alot of constant moving . Must be able to make rate and maintain rate. Must be willing to be flexible or noone will make it in this workplace of business.
good,"Work hours are long, hard to juggle if full time student "
good,"Very easy, I’m just a social person and I dont get to be social at all. I’m standing for 10 hours which isn’t bad if I could talk. But we dont, the people there are nice but everyone looks like they hate their life"
good,Its a very good place as a first job but one should see their growth and shift accordingly. The work place is very much like collage and fun to work with
good,The primary responsibilities of Amazon order pickers include the following: Locating merchandise to fulfill picking tickets. Labeling specific inventory types. Following proper loading and safety procedures at all times. Putting deliveries away in the appropriate area.
good,I worked part time for amazon which is constant moving .They run it like boot camp but its good for structure of the working people. You have to have great work ethics to work here.
good,"Everyone is extremely welcoming and willing to help you learn. If you receive an overnight shift as your first assignment, it can be rough to adjust. You need to be driven by numbers - have a passion for them. It's fast paced with a lot of computer applications to juggle. This life is not for everyone - you have to honestly weigh your priorities in life."
good,The 4 day work week is nice but the 10 hour days can be very boring doing the same thing over and over again. It is a good steady job if you can just put your head down and work.
good,"It’s a good place ! I just was not guaranteed hours I had to go online to get hours and it was always hard to pick the hours that fit my schedule, so i"
good,"Working there I productive, fast paced, and fun to work with other employees. Another thing is that other associates try to keep the work place safe for others when working."
good,"I enjoyed picking more than I did packing, I was only packing sometimes and it was the worst part of the job! Picking is enjoyable your always on the move and that’s what i prefer. Great place to work."
good,"It was okay working at Amazon, to many rules to follow. Some of the superiors kept an eye on me as if to see if I was working or not but on the positive side they would give little incentives for the hard I have done or the hard work I put into their Company."
good,"Focus on just yourself , don’t let it get the best of you , it can either break or make you . Some actually care for you other can careless , the pay is good"
good,"Scanning products and placing them where a screen asks you to is the majority of the day. Standing for long hours on end are part of the requirement. There are some points in time where they have mandatory over time, especially during their peak seasons, that being the holidays."
good,"Pros: Very good management. Safe work environment. Good work training. Good experience. Chances to grow within company."
good,"basic pay 15"
good,This company is excellent at organizing groups and teams of individuals. Change is rapid and sometimes instant. Overall they're a decent company to work for.
good,"I had a good time working with amazon only because of my coworkers the managers didnt really care about us emplyees and dont listen . "
good,My problem at Amazon was the hours and work schedule. Spent more time at amazon then i did at home. Body was hurting joint pains and back pains and stiffness
good,"At the time I worked there the rate of pay was much less than it is now, the benefits were pretty great though and a huge selling point for most people. The work was tedious but most jobs are. If you want to put in minimal effort for decent pay its probably a pretty efficient place to work. Be prepared for overtime though especially during peak."
good,I worked 3 positions during my time at amazon. Management is severely disorganized and managers change often. The way they allocated who goes where was a mess when I left. HR isn’t good for much. Good luck getting the correct accommodations if you’re mentally ill. The rates got progressively higher through my time there. 4 days on and 3 days off was nice. Benefits are awesome.
good,The pay is good for the type of work. But the job is very tolling on the body.   Some management is wonderful some not so much. A lot of bitter employees.
good,"Ten hour work shift ,management is all on you about production, be are to short for the time we have to walk to the break room ,benefit are great     one for the rreason I'm still there"
good,"Good place to work"
good,"I was only an associate, building cardboard drawers."
good,"You could be doing a variety of different things. Stowing items, picking items, receiving items, packing items. You don't get to choose when you apply, but you are able to transfer positions once hired. "
good,"Management is great, helpful and only way you'll make a living is in management. Fair wages for this area, you will only get 20+ hours during peak season, other than that be prepared for a lot of VTO time."
good,They should have a age limit on who work in their warehouse as you only get half an hour break and the rest of time you standing on your feet for hours on end without the opportunity to sit down.
good,"Tres compétitive , production production sont les mots mots-clés"
good,"I've been at Amazon for eight years in roles that have always dealt with the customer over email or phone. They have always been flexible with my schedule and I have accrued over a month a year in vacation at this point. I can't complain about their health insurance, it fits my needs well. The management can be good or bad, really depends on the person. The culture can be good or bad, really depends on the team. There are a thousands teams, roles and managers at Amazon so your experience would of course be unique. The hardest part of working at Amazon is that things are always changing and you're often making things up as you go along. The enjoyable parts are that it's in the center of town so commuting for me is easy, they pay well and they are very casual in their attire. It's not a bad place to work but I can definitely see how it can burn people out over the years."
good,The coworkers that you meet while working are friendly people and are easy to get along with. The mangers are not that interactive with the employees and the warehouse can get hot at times. Make sure to dress comfortable and stay hydrated. You stand or walk the time that you are there but the pay and benefits that amazon provides are nice.
good,enjoyable work environment. Work culture is great. great management. Great company to learn and develop. Great company to develop and enhance in your career
good,good place to work learned to work in teams and cooperate with others the management was very friendly the only downside is it is a lot of work and you get sore
good,"I enjoyed the fact that the work was rather secluded. My first managers were fantastic and very understanding and accommodating. About 6 months into my employment, the warehouse rotated managers and my new one was very unfair. Work conditions during winter were nice, but during summer it was too hot for how physical the work was, especially in dock/truck areas. The policy for time off task was not very fair."
good,"It was okay to work here job was too demanding for my liking, I ultimately got injured for working to fast and decided to resign for the safety of my health"
good,Working at Amazon is a grind. A typical work week is around 50 hrs with the schedule being 4 work days each week with 12 hour shifts (sometimes longer).
good,"Accomplishes staff job results by coaching, counseling, and disciplining employees; planning, monitoring, and appraising job results; conducting training; implementing enforcing systems, policies, and procedures."
good,"Amazon is a decent place to work. You are surrounded by people, so your not sitting somewhere by yourself while you do your job, which is a plus. "
good,"Depending on your location and lifestyle this could be a good job for you. On the other hand, if you value a work life balance there is a limited amount of scheduling for you majority 13 -14 hour days will leave you wondering is it worth it."
good,"Management not too great but worked with some great people who made the job easier! Suppose to have employee review every 3 months to discuss performance,raises, etc. never had mine on time so be aware!"
good,I packed Items from conveyor belt for shipping and putting it in box's and getting them ready to go on the trucks so they can get to where they are going some of went to peoples homes and to the stores
good,"My review is good nice experience nice schedule nice hours wouldn’t mind working there again, only thing I didnt like was the short breaks and standing on your feet all day"
good,"I worked nights which was okay except after a while I felt like all I did was go to work, go home, sleep, and then do it all again. It eventually got to be too much and I had no social life. I enjoy the work it was fairly easy. I recommend it to anyone it just wasn't a good fit for me."
good,"Workers are definitely kept busy here. My only issue was when I tried to change to part time hours, I was waiting for weeks and nothing happened, even though there were other people working part time as well."
good,Very easy-going workplace environment with people dedicated to making sure you have little difficulty doing your job. Fast paced work environment as well.
good,Awesome staffing real good with balancing the choices between hours good techniques for getting started for work and preping for the shift to start. Would reconsider
good,Management sucks for sure. Well it use to. Honestly I don’t have much of anything to say regarding them besides management being extremely unprofessional. That’s all
good,"I am a Seasonal Sortation Associate. That just means I work in the warehouse. The workload that this job entails is manageable when you are dedicated and are willing to work as a team and cooperate with others. It gets stressful sometimes, but (in my experience, I don't know about other warehouses) the internal factors outside the work are almost too much to deal with. In short, the management is garbage in my warehouse, and you have to jump through hurdles to get anything resolved. The work culture and people here are awesome, though."
good,"A difficult place to work not interested in working there again. Amazon,com takes advantage of its workers while taking a huge amount of profit. Although good at what they do id advise against seeking a job there."
good,i enjoyed amazon a lot. I wish more people would work there. The experience was fun and eventful. The staff is nice and Human resources are super helpful.
good,"Long hours of standing, walking, lifting boxes,scanning items. It can be repetitive and boring. They do try to make it fun with raffles, employee appreciation day and other events. Managers always come and go, you have to get to know each one personally. Some are good and some aren't. The hardest part of the job are the long hours on your feet and the mandatory overtime that can be called with little notice. The best part of the job is sometimes you get free stuff."
good,"Amazon is highly results driven, and can be frustrating at times. The management is good, and most of the coworkers were great. The break room was large and had a lot of perks."
good,Amazon was definitely a experience I won’t forget. Great management and everyone is really focused on getting their job done breaks were short and the break room wasn’t even close to the working area
good,"Basically it’s pretty awesome I’m paid $15/hr to do a very simple easy job, but we all know if something is too good to be true it usually is. The management is terrible at times. You make one mistake and they come to talk to you about it and possibly write you up. It’s easy during the holiday season because the company desperately needs people to stay, but once Christmas passes your job is on the line."
good,We have to support with work environment culture at the same time we prove our best thinks there also we encarge the outr team members at the same time
good,Good but low hours and unsure on job security. Management was really cool. They had a fun culture and different things to do one holidays but seasonal didnt get any benefits
good,Nothing really works which stops you from reaching your rate and then you get written up for not making it. All in all a temporary job wouldn't recommend working at this building
good,"I would stand in a stationary position for 10 hour days, stocking an automated system. The pay wasn't that good for the work you do. However, it was a stable job that had so fun and interesting coworkers that make it worth going to work."
good,"Work culture is great but the salary is too low"
good,"its good company with friendly behavior "
good,"Daily workload was very reasonable. If you planned effectively work was generally very simple. The one caveat however is that sometimes daily there would be a change in process or policy and you have to be very good at pivoting and maintaining operational effectiveness. Job security is also a bit of a question mark as they are constantly creating, opening and closing different types of retail spaces as they're still trying to find their niche."
good,"Amazon is good at providing benefits and discounts to its employees, but they have a pattern of choosing productivity and fast results over employee safety and employee job ease. They will push employees to their limits in the name of saving money and customer satisfaction. Doing what they do is not a bad thing, but it gets excessive when you provide the bare minimum of employee assistance and make people have to strain and push themselves to be deemed a good employee. Hard work is good, but it gets too much to handle and at the end of the day, even the most fit employees are left drained and injured after each work day. The management was inconsistent, but I thought the managers did care and did mean well. The culture tried to be focused on customer promise, but that deteriorated when their became high stress situations and the job just simply needed to be done. The work days are usually 6-7 hours depending on how late you want to stay. I wish there were more opportunities to get more hours and that the opportunities they did offer to move up were provided to everyone equally instead of a select group that the managers find favor in. The most frustrating part was the company's choice of customers getting their packages early at the expense of the employee and the use of the absolute bare minimum amount of employee power to save a small amount in comparison how much money the company makes. The pros are good benefits, lots of opportunities for time off, good pay, and that it is part-time for students such as myself."
good,"It's hard work. Only problem was we would have 3 hour shifts a lot so it was not worth the gas. The managers know how to talk to their staff with dignity. They would say ""we know you are working hard but is their any way you could pick up the pace safely"" Other amazon facility's I hear the PAs would just yell at you rudely."
good,"Amazon was a good experience, i worked with nice people and enjoyed most things about this job. It helps you keep active and having 3 days off gives you at least one week day to keep your appointments etc."
good,"They pay was very good , nice and furnished canteen high standars of health and safety. Good coworkers, the menagement were ok a bit rude sometimes they been pushing with unrealistic targets."
good,"My typical day at work is filled with productive work and focused on leadership principles an Amazonian culture follows daily. Every day is day one in Amazon where you learn something new each day that you can utilize as a resourceful experience in the future as you progress your career within the company. Management varies depending on different leadership styles a manager will offer to the team which is what makes Amazon a unique company to work for. The hardest part of being in Amazon is the phrase ""the only thing constant is the change"". Ambiguity is big on Amazon and to be an Amazonian, you must be adaptable and flexible. The most enjoyable part of being an Amazonian is the people you work with. Everyone has their own specialty that adds value in the company. The people itself and our customers are what makes our culture so diverse and amazing."
good,"The time off and lower management needs to monitored more thoroughly. I felt there was too much inappropriate and favoritism type of behaviour happening. It was extreme and offensive and I felt more could and eventually have to be done. This was also a brand new, largest to that date distribution center and there will be hiccups and it takes time to weed out the bad apples. Hopefully this part of the culture there will change sooner than later."
good,"A fun place to work with amazing culture. I am was happy to mentor a the team there. This was my first job and was a good fit for me."
good,Working there was overall pretty good. I met a lot of new friends and I enjoyed being there for most of it. Everyone was really nice however the work load was to much for one person
good,It was a good place to work. I would have stayed longer but I had college. The managers were very understanding and were very good people. The workers were also very nice.
good,"working hours are unsociable, good pay, learned how  to pack boxes for 2 months. Hardest part of job was probably understanding machines at first but once you got used to it was fine."
good,"I been working there for 3 month now and my hours there is getting less and less. Also, trying to change my schedule takes a long period of time. But they do give extra time for a hour or 4/"
good,It was a struggle going through the job with the time of work they offered. I would go into work at 6:00 P.M and be getting out Around 4:00 A.M. and during the holidays it was longer. Stressing work environment due to if the work wasn't completed right it would be a right up. Some managers had favorites and wasn't healthy for the job.
good,"Good management lots of opportunities to grow. "
good,It's an ok job if you enjoy working in a fast paced environment and don't mind working more than 8 hours a day. The benefits are good and they are well worth it. The hours are reasonable but sometimes you may work more during the holiday season.
good,"It was a huge company inside was very culture diverse. I remember the warm up we had to do before working along with updates on our department performance. I felt very institutionalize working in a small cubicle pack station but it was ok. I enjoyed the experience the atmosphere was fun, met some geneuine people an learned alot about the company."
good,very stressful work place all about how your numbers are there is no union they will fire quick as they hire you its crazy sometimes working 10 to 12 hors on your feet walking at least 15 miles
good,"'ve been at Amazon for a month now, and I've seen none of the horror stories being communicated to the public, although Amazon is a large enough company that I'm sure there are good pockets and bad pockets. Everyone here is really smart, and wants to succeed both personally, and as a company. People collaborate and help each other, focus on data, and truly focus on the customer."
good,"I know some jobs can be harder than others, like picking (though I never had that job). It's not entirely fair for some jobs to be more strenuous and not pay more, but that's my opinion. Also, no sitting, which can kill your feet."
good,"A very fast pace job and they go by your rate! You have to have a 100% rate in order to keep a job, so if you have a rate of 99.9% they will still let you go. You can go back after 90 days."
good,"Most days are productive and we can work as a team but its literally high school all over again with the drama, rumors, favoritism, childish behavior and the occasional unfairness."
good,my typical night at work was auditing the boxes before they depart the building. it was called inventory control quality assurance. the culture was different but nice to be around. i enjoyed every moment of my job.
good,"Amazon employees were quick to help if needed and everyone is nice. Management is great, if you have questions they are quick to answer or to get you the answers you need."
good,"Working at Amazon was Amazon was an overnight job, I learned how to pack a moving truck and how to operate a pallete jack. Ideally, the most important skill I learned is how to use my strengths and skills for the benefit of the team."
good,"I used to work at a different hub but transferred because I moved. The current hub I work for is extremely small and they do not have a lot of traffic coming in and going out. I used to work grave yard but now I work with the Amazon Flex Drivers and now my hours get reduced. Almost every day there is VTO, Voluntary time off, if you do not accept it you can go in and have literately nothing to do. You cannot sit down so you are stuck walking around doing nothing and pretending to be busy. Really, everyone knows there is nothing to be busy doing. When I worked grave yard at my current hub they also had VTO once the trucks were unloaded and all packages are sorted. So really, you cannot get around not accepting VTO. At the previous hub I worked for, I was always busy! I worked grave yard there and would even stay past my normal shift to help out and scan in packages that did not get sorted during the shift. Basically, if you want to get the hours Amazon says you will work, which is about 24 - 25 hours a week, you need to work at a large hub. If my old hub was not so far from my new residence I would defiantly transfer back because this is absolutely ridiculous that Amazon does not have work for me during my shift and has me stand around fiddling my thumbs."
good,"My Supervisor and Manager are very polite and friendly. I have gained a lot of experiences otherwise from just scanning. I am willing to learn new skills and techniques. You could just speak to a manager or supervisor and they won't refuse to help. Exercising before work can be fun each day. A lot of packages can come unexpectedly and they can be heavy, sometimes that can be the hardest part of the job. However I admire how the working area is spacious and not cluttered."
good,not for the long haul. not for the faint heart. needs all day dedication. love of customer service. safety should be on top of everything you do for sure
good,A typical day at work would be coming in and starting of with stretches. After we stretched we would discus how the work shift would go and how much of load we have for the night. After we would get assigned to a row on a conveyor belt were we would sort and scan the boxes to it's correct bag to be delivered. After the night we would grab the packaged bags and sort them and scan the full bags to it's correct van to be delivered.  The only thing I didn't like was the manager at the time. They would tell us to focus on our own work but doing that would usually slow the line because others needed help.
good,"It was a good first job, paid 12.50 an hour i believe. Three breaks between work time, easy rules to follow and keeps you busy. I was a picker(this job requires whatever comes on the screen of your selected electronic device and thats what a customer ordered requiring you to pick and place on a conveyer belt.)"
good,"I guess it all depends on the person. Some people can actually handle this job, and there are some that can't. I can't speak for everyone if they will like this job or not. If you are one of the people that can work really fast and quick paced, then this might be the job for you. If you are one of those people that can't work fast paced, you might not like this job unless you think you can handle it. I thought I could handle this job, but maybe this isn't the job for me. My advice is, if you think this is a type of job where you may not like working here and not having a job you like, I would reconsider not doing this job. "
good,"A typical day in work is busy and very fast paced, from this I have learnt how to manage my time and remain clam when facing stressful situations. The management team is always there when or if I need advise and guidance."
good,"slow or super busy with a small break"
good,very easy and relax job but with bad management and HR.For exemple one day for misunderstanding or english issue an Op manager humiliate me in front of everybody and was about to fire me.
good,"It was a great place to work, as I was part of a team in a large warehouse dealing with orders and insuring the area was safe at all times, the supervisors were excellent at keeping me informed on tasks that needed to be done at every point in my shifts and that I enjoyed that the atmosphere wasn't tense and everyone got on very well."
good,The workplace culture wasn't bad.  It was a repetitive job where you were on your feet 9 1/2 hours a day.  It is a good opportunity for young people that are able to stand for long periods of time and experience lifting and bending all day long.
good,"I met some great people while I was there. I think the managers are not strict enough with the employees & they favored some more than others. Mainly the ones who would hang around & do nothing. If there was another location opened in NYC, Manhattan I would definitely apply there. It would have to be above 34th street."
good,Working at amazon was amazing and fun because I had a very nice supervisor and team lead.Lovely and clean environment which is climate controlled.Thanks
good,"Too many questions targeted you as an ""undesirable."" I was discharged, but told I could appeal due to my above average score in the mid-size items to be stowed. Ridiculous! Certain policies and practices are down right hypocritical."
good,"- Smart coworkers "
good,"Ambiente gradevole e dinamico,massima attenzione alla sicurezza dei lavoratori,stipendio ottimo più benefit aziendali."
good,"Long shifts but fly by quickly, benefit hours are yours to use at your own digression. Awesome benefits with 401k. Two paid 15 minute breaks. Fun place to work but can be tough at times."
good,the typical day at work would comprise of resolving trouble tickets and i find it to monotonous and i lack the intellect to work in such a monotonous environment for a brief period of time and would like to relocate to a job which challenges me every day
good,The environment at Amazon was fast paced and there always opportunities for advancement. The management team was always willing to discuss any issues you may have had and HR was always friendly
good,"I loved working there! The hours were long and it's a lot of hard work, but pay is amazing. You do work 10 or so hours 4 days a week and during peak you could work anywhere from 5- 6 days a week, so for me there wasn't enough time for friends and family because you would just want to sleep or catch up on other responsibilities."
good,"Il lavoro nn era gestito bene però molto stimolante ,lavoro all aria aperta, individuale ."
good,"Decent hours, respectful supervisors. It is 12 hour days, but with the fast-paced environment it did not feel like 12 hour days. I worked independently 99% of the time!"
good,On seasonal days is mandatory to work an extra 20 hours on top of the 40 hours already worked.  There is a high turn over rate because of this stressful job.  Especially if working overnight.
good,"The work can get difficult when there is a big shipment of orders coming in, but the tasks to preform is easy, it just gets to a point where you work really fast."
good,"the typical day of work was a race everyday. I learned that it is different  types of jobs for everyone. I dont have too many words to share about management. dont know about the culture, it was too far ago. Working to get a qouta is the hardest part of the job and the long hrs. The people was the best part of the job."
good,I honestly have nothing to say as far as the review but that the job gets boring after a while . The repetitiveness of the job is annoying . They make you stand for ten hours . You are only allowed to really use the bathroom when you are on break cause if not you are marked off task.
good,"Typical day was go in straight to stand up, managers put out some information and then straight to work. I am a picker and pick items that customers have bought through the internet.  It is a big warehouse and I walk for 9 hrs picking orders but we do have a 30 min. lunch break and two 15 minute breaks."
good,Enjoyed the people I worked alongside but management was continuously changing and the people who would be moved up were favorites not people who were best suited for the job.Rates are important but if people ran into issues the company would sometimes not care.
good,The manager at my location was not meeting standards at all. Was not commutating to there associate and making sure everyone is doing well. There always on their laptops.
good,Very faced paced and stressful to those who arent used to a fst paced environment. Lunch trucks and scheduled breaks help keep you on track and focused.
good,It was hard working job back breaking not for some one like me it had good pay and benefits but I didn't really like how short the two breaks a day they gave us were
good,Not everyone is nice but i enjoy working there. You get a good pay and its a good work place although my experience wasnt pleasant due to being pregnant and not having accommodations
good,"It a fun place to work if you can grow up in the company they give the chance depending on your performance."
good,"Sono stata una picker assunta nel periodo natalizio e quindi poi eliminata finito il periodo. Lavoro frenetico ma piacevole, sopprattutto grazie al supporto dei colleghi che anche con un sorriso ti cambiavano la giornata. Aria più cupa e pesante da parte dei manager e leader (non tutti). Mensa favolosa e bagni sempre impeccabili. Ricordo solo le parole della responsabile delle risorse umane nel congedarci: siete tutte persone meravigliose. Vi lasciamo a casa perchè  non c'è più posto. Peccato che poi con le agenzie ne entravano a frotte. Grazie al nuovo Governo credo che tutto questo finirà."
good,"negativ"
good,"I was overall excited and positive about working for amazon despite the flaws. It was fun, busy at times. It took group effort at times to get the job done. VTO was definitely a plus for people using public transportation especially when you are going to be late due to bus or train etc."
good,"some good people in here, hitting targets can be challenging, get to see hundreds of various products.Some people love working here others its just a stop gap so skill levels vary a lot."
good,management is good. it a four hours shift. they always offer vto volunteer time off and vet volunteer enter time. you do all kind of job from sorting to loading and unloading trucks .
good,Not a terrible job the managers were great and friendly. Good work moral and family atmosphere. Also feeding you free food and drinks and giving out gifts and gift cards. The only negative side was the hours were draining and seeing the same brown boxes for 8 hours dives you mad.
good,"The work was monotonous and consisted of scanning packages to pallets. The pay was competitive and was the saving grace of the job. The work is mindnumbing, explaining why shifts were limited to 4 hours"
good,"alright. great benefits. long hours. tough work. The warehouse jobs are tough work with quotas and they can be good fit temporarily or long term for some people, but it is not for everyone."
good,"You are working for 10 hours doing the same thing. You are given a schedule that you did not want. You are put in an area and trained in that area but not cross-trained in another area until you are needed. You have some PAs that show favoritism and will make sure their friends make their ""quota"" before you."
good,"It's hard, stressful work. The easiest hard job I've ever had. The people are amazing, everyone is a character. Management is understanding and helpful most of the time."
good,I worked at Amazon for 9 years. started off as a temp and got hired on full-time I have tried to advance after being there for so long and never got a position.
good,"It would be noisy from all the machines, but it was quick paced and slow at times. At Amazon, everything had to be done quick and correct. It was two thirty minutes breaks, one paid and one unpaid."
good,"Work life balance was ok and the pay was also fair."
good,"The job is like a workout because it is very physical. You have to be constantly on your feet and moving your body, carrying, pushing and lifting boxes of different sizes to different locations. You meet a lot of different people with diverse culture and you learn a lot from them. The management however doesn't seem to get their act straight. There's always an issue on who is leading what or who needs to do this or that. If that gets straightened, I am pretty sure the facility will run at its best!!!"
good,"As I only worked there for a short period of time, during the Christmas season, I will admit I am unaware of what it would be like out of season. While I was there, it was very chaotic and constantly moving"
good,"They say that you work up to 5 hours a day, but many days you find yourself working only up to 3-4 hours because of how slow-paced it is."
good,"If you don't mind working hard and working late hours, this is not a bad gig to have. Requires good communication skills and a little bit of muscle at times but another than that, it's fairly easy work."
good,"The work is fairly easy, just VERY tedious, and repetitive. Common work speed is picking an item about every 5 seconds or 400 units per hour. Workplace is filled with childish people with a huge lack of manners. The most enjoyable part of the job was the money and leaving."
good,Everything started out fine but when I told them I was leaving the managers treated me like garbage. I had to quit before they had a chance to unfairly fire me.
good,"I had fun with my co-workers. The pay was great for being bi-weekly and the day went by when your busy. There were some slow days where they offer VTO. It was nice to take but did damage to your pay. I've learned alot at amazon like pallet stacking, using a pallet jack, stowing items, and being on an order picker. They have many different ethnicity at Amazon, downside some don't speak audible english. Overall manager will be managers and Amazon is a great place to start for someone out of high school."
good,"Good culture with open door policy, no barriers to have direct connect with higher leadership team. Great perks like leaves, overtime and night shift pay. Compensation is best in the market. Furthermore are the employee vested shares."
good,"Honestly my experience working for Amazon FC has been typically pleasant. While i have heard from others comparing it to a prison, i believe it depends on what department you are placed in, what shift  you get placed on, and how well your managers performs their tasks."
good,The job in which I worked does not challenge your intellect ability. Overall its a good company to work for temporarily. Employees are not treated valuable or appreciated. Many people of management shows favorites.
good,"Overall Amazon is a very fast paced, cutthroat company. If you do not make the quotas they expect of you then do not expect to last long there. They are always hiring which means that letting you go will never be an issue. Also, majority of the work is physically challenging as well so being in good health is a must. The upside to working for the company is great pay, starting at $12, and a wide scope of benefits."
good,Fun and innovative program.  Supportive management for career development and exploration.  They have good tea in the kitchen.  Why do I have to write this review?
good,I was able to be in a good work setting. I felt there was always a goal to meet which encouraged me to work much harder than I do. What I enjoyed the most is completing tasks and learning from every work experience.
good,"Originally I started working at Amazon so I could attend college. At the time I thoroughly enjoyed working there. On a normal day I would unload trucks, trailers and TDR trailers into the building. For me it has been a social playground of sorts because of the drastic palate of people working there. Management is understanding for the most part, but there are some that couldn't care less."
good,"Probably a better job for people who are physically able to work full time. I had a hard time working the long hours, but part time workers make an extra 3 dollars an hour because they do not get benefits so that was really nice."
good,Entreprise moyenne partis parce que ma santé n était pas valide
good,"It's not a horrible place to work, but be prepared to work hard. It comes with benefits and great pay. You are responsible for not only your own safety but the safety of others around you so it gives you a team type of feel, but you are working on your own."
good,I learned a lot with amazon. It is a very technological company. Very much customer centered. I enjoyed getting trained in new things all the time. Management is very good about showing gratitude.
good,If I were younger it would be a great place to start my job building career. Demand for quota rate is difficult to build up too but with a bit better training up front about speed of line would help people understand the job better.
good,"ambiente stimolante ,ben organizzato,orari lavorativi flessibili"
good,"Great company to work for, however, if working night shift, it becomes difficult for your life not to revolve around work due to working all night and sleeping all day."
good,Beaucoup d'aide de la part des managers. A l'écoute des problèmes des employés.
good,When I first began working there it was fun and easy then it became way too strict on rates and the time you get off task it started feeling like a jail so I just gave up on everything they're not paying enough for that.
good,It was a great oppertunity in which I learned a lot of new things. It is a great place to start and possibly turn into a career if you are persistent.
good,"corporate isn't helpful either"
good,"Amazon is doing lot's of cool stuff...but lots of boring stuff too. There are really well run teams...and very badly run teams. The experience for software managers and engineers is all over the board, from really run low operational load teams to teams where people burn out after a year."
good,"I love a lot of the people I work with but the level of clear favoritism there is astounding and insulting. I train new people the way they should be trained and stay 30-60mins longer sometimes to help after shift when no one else will and I don't feel I get the respect I'm owed. They let certain people stand around and do nothing while the rest of us have to break our back working in the trucks lifting heavy boxes. There are at least two new people who they always put in charge of certain areas, even over those of us who have been there much longer, and never even make them load trucks or scan on the line even though they get paid the same as others."
good,"Overall my experiences are positive with Amazon."
good,"usually begins with a lot of the same routine, working from start to finish, stacking pallets, making boxes to fill up with items off wall, being timed while working on the clock robots"
good,Hours are not reliable. You never know when you will be off as the have the option to flex up or down 1 hour of your scheduled shift. They over hired for peak season and we are now only working 3 hour shifts.
good,"You are allowed to speak and take 5 minutes out if you are getting tired. Amazon are a company that like things to be perfect, and as the training was quite poor, my performance in the first few shifts really struggled."
good,"I love working for Amazon, however the pay is fairly poor for a company racking in big bucks! To see benefits you have to give at least 40+ hours a week and the customer is always right, even when their wrong."
good,"I started at Amazon FC and was put into a receiving position, in which I never thought I would be able to do. I was driving a forklift also know as the order picker. I was trained/certified within a day to drive. The managers are awesome they love to answer any questions you have and help you to understand and excel at you job."
good,On your first day they do a decent job of showing you around they just show the main places where most people work at. I’ve learned that you really have to get a lot of rest while you are at home or your night/day is going to suck.
good,great benefits but overworked and never have time for your self because you will be sleeping any time you have off. Holiday is insane working nonstop every day of the week almost.
good,"it is a fast paced warehouse job, that is quota based, in my opinion 99% of the time it is attainable, but there is that 1% that you can not do anything about having a low quota number, which can end up biting you in the but occasionally, though people there are just simply put a fun bunch"
good,"I came into this job knowing it was going to be difficult. However, they constantly are pushing you to succeed, which is great, except when you falter even 1 day, even if it's not in your control, you will can get punished. "
good,"rate rate rate everyday. "
good,Amazon is always hiring at no worries but they don’t pay you lot money unless you have to work hard on productive to get extra money. That is only way you work hard by giving out your performance at speed environment.
good,"Hours are long but the pay was good. associates are friendly, breaks were ok. HR is poor, they are low staffed and very forgetful. Work was easy, especially on slow days"
good,It depends on the person. The department I was in I walked 19 miles a day for 10 hours a day breaks arent long enough. The pay was great the over time was wonderful I'd go back but not to the pick department its horrible in the pick department
good,"To much standing, standing all night, stressful. Always rushing you. But its a very fun place to work. Time goes by super fast because they are always busy and can't keep track of time."
good,"You work with really smart people which is awesome. However, constant re-org and shifting makes sit hard to build momentum for your own career at times.  Plus, if you aren't alpha or not willing to be the loudest in the room or be a jerk at times, you won't advance."
good,"Poor management and managers leaving was like a revolving door and reductions in pay, quick turnovers as far as new hires and people leaving company. Machines and computers at work stations were faulty and needed belts to properly work so that employees could meet desired productivity and expected quotas."
good,Too fast paced. High quotas had to met each day. Standing at a station all day ended up hurting my back each day from standing. Long walks just to go to the bathroom and eat lunch.
good,At amazon the people are well diverse and kind nature everyone just knows the flow of the warehouse.  on a normal day the most enjoyable part was getting to work as a team with some of my closets friends
good,"There was much more heavy lifting than I had hoped for but I do enjoy physical labor rather than sitting at a desk. Good workers are often given more workload because they can handle it, creating over worked employees with not much given in return from day to day. Work hard and be sore and exhausted at the end of a long day, or work at a more average rate? I guess it depends on your work ethics and your bodies ability."
good,"A typical amazon work day starts off slow, then it starts to lick up as the day goes by. I learned how to stack boxes neatly, and how to operate a standup, and clamp forklift. Management at Amazon is absolutely Amazing. They treat you with respect, and are very nice. The workplace and culture at Amazon is up to par. The hardest part about working at amazon was training and keeping up with your other duties at the same time. The most enjoyable part about Amazon were the meetings."
good,Amazon has its ups and downs but of course it could always be better.Me as an associate I had to make the best of my employment.Its all about how you can adapt to environment.Everybody is not made to work at Amazon.
good,"Easy, non stressful, fun environment. Constantly meeting new people. May not be the right job for every one because it is an office job where you sit at your desk for a full 8 hours."
good,"I liked it cuz I was trained to different this he instead of always doing the same thing working working her you always had a rate you had to j"
good,"You have to put your mind in a different place when you come to work at Amazon. Before you are placed in any department, please believe you are walking in with blind folds on your eyes. you never know what to expect"
good,Overall not too bad for a warehouse environment. Fast paced but doable for an average person. Overall nice people who treat others well an with respect.
good,"Working at the Amazon in Ruskin is a big turn over,  If you don't get the puduction and quality down during the 2nd week managers will write you up and fire you the next week,   they will not give you a chance to even learn the job."
good,i worked at the chsapeake location and the management team need to learn how to be professional. if they dont like you u will never get ahead in this company
good,It's a fast paced warehouse. Managers are all good open door policy. Good benefits all in all it was a good company to work for the. Multiple different shifts
good,"Amazon is a cool place to work, very easy, but the shifts are very long. some of the managers are very strict. They should have longer lunches because we are on our feet for so long, a longer lunch is much needed."
good,"Amazon is a very 9-5 job except it is 7-530pm for me and it is most definitely a work to live job meaning you need a job and money but cant wait to get out. This place is a stepping stone for 99% of people. There is a lot of physical work requirements which usually takes place in around 78 degrees which after moving quite a bit can feel rather hot. They will tell you the warehouse is regulated for the products, not your personal comfort. Management treats everyone well. This is not an upsetting place to work and is enough for some people. However if you have a degree, or are pursuing one then i advise this be a temporary position. This facility is 24 hours a day, even holidays. The managers get paid decently but they also are salary and can be told suddenly they are getting switched to nights for the next month to help out. Money isn't everything, i would not take a management position there. Also, they can tell you before noon on a Friday that you now have mandatory over time so if you made plans recently, say goodbye or be prepared to use your slowly accumulated time off. My best advice if you decide to work for them is make it temporary, strive to do better, do the best you can while you work there and don't watch the clock because your day will feel like two."
good,"I had a new manager that was not Amazon material. This made my last 6 months very tough. My workload was unreasonable and I was extremely stressed out all the time. Long story short, I ended up leaving and took my knowledge/ experience elsewhere. She was let go 2 weeks after I left due to complaints and high turn over. If I knew that was going to happen, I would have stayed."
good,The day would begin at 6:30. We would start with stand up like going over the things for the day such as safety and our goals for the day. Then get to packing.The hardest part was standing in one place for long periods at a time for ten hours a day. Most enjoyable part was meeting new people since there were many employees in different areas.
good,"I used to work with very friendly colleagues which makes it easy to get out of bed in the mornning."
good,"I really enjoy the job. The fast pace and always moving kept me up. We began working at 7 by packing or sometimes I would do picks. The managing team was very nice and always help out,"
good,"Being a part of a new project was hard, hours weren't the best. Too many politics. As soon as you get used to one change, they make another. I like most of the company."
good,We work 10 hour shift 4 sometimes 5 days a week. We are a busy company especially during peak season. During peak season  we can work up to six days a week. I process items  and drive the form lift.
good,"Amazon is a good place to work specially if you are a fresher and area looking to get into customer related field, but the only thing that hurts is the work life balance. "
good,"Is a nice place of work ! With many hours of work !"
good,so when I was at Amazon it was a really fun place to work at but when you have someone else in front of you and you get told by your manager that you have to be kind and let them pick but then you set for about 20mins then you get coded time off task and then you get fired from your job that's is unfair.
good,"Amazon warehouse is overall a good warehouse with great benefits. My only complaint I would have is the company has there favorites within the company, so everyone isn't treated fairly"
good,was a hard going job and some day flew in and other took ages was good money. made good friends when I was there and would go back and work there again if I had to
good,"Fast paced, and had incentives such as drawings for gift cards if you work hard, but some people didn't so a lot of the work fell more on the harder workers. It was ok. Good part time because it is very physical. Dealing with the HR and managers were so so...the managers listened but they never solved a problem. They just referred you to another manager or area. The HR basically answered all but the setup as really unclear due to the fact they operate off a point system and you would get points for something that wasn't your fault like when it snowed and you had no way. They also would promise you would leave early and on a day like that day you would leave a hour late. So it was ok but nothing I would brag about-"
good,"On paper, the job is easy, but in practice, its a strain on the body. I go to work and I expect to power walk about 15-25 miles a day. I get little social interaction throughout the day unless something unexpected happens. It's all to I can do to keep up rate. Sometimes it's easier than others but its the luck of the draw with the path. Sometimes I bounce around different parts of the mods, and other times it's actually decent. However, it is rarely the latter. Management is great and understanding; they really trying to work with you. I can say that my body has never been in better shape."
good,"Amazon is a good working place with suitable working hours, I enjoyed my time at Amazon and would recommend eny one to work there."
good,"Amazon is a company that aims for nothing but improvement, with or without you. When it comes to warehouse jobs, this work is as easy as it gets compared to the rest and it pays a decent amount of money. Though some work may be tedious, with the strong enforcement of safety you can rest assured that the tedious work is better than what most other warehouses will put you through. They do a great job of making you feel like you matter, though inevitably what really matters is the numbers being made at the end of the day, and that's alright, it's a job after all. If you work really hard and try to prove a point to your management there is always room for promotions year round. If you don't plan on moving up, however, I don't recommend staying around for long. As I said, the work gets tedious, mind numbing at times. Amazon proves to be a great stepping stone for you to decide if you want to progress with them or save and decide what your next step in life is."
good,"Amazon expands quickly and work is attractive sometimes. But in my team, people leave late after work or always take their computer to work at home, which makes me feel stressed."
good,"Having worked with Amazon for a brief time, I hadn't much really to say other than it was a tremendous joy to work alongside so many others that would work as hard as myself and strive everyday to conquer new challenges and push themselves ever further. Each day was always different, never was anything the same or boring. I learned how to better manage my work space while stacking boxes within trucks, as well as the importance of safety while walking through the pallet aisles. People from all over the world seemed to work there, each one bringing with them their own bit of home, their culture and traditions."
good,"I like the company but I don't like getting off at 4 in the morning, my diet has also been affected by the hours worked some days I wake up and go straight to work, and out breaks are very short so there's little to no time to eat"
good,"spolupracovníci byly super milý a hrozně sympatický pěkný holky :D"
good,"Amazon IND2 is the best Amazon facility in Indiana to work for. Though you'll feel physical soaring a few days after you start, so it's highly recommended that you buy some soft comfortable shoes to walk in, because also you will be walking MILES per week at Amazon. Unless they put you into something like Packaging. Pickers, Stowers, Team Lift, and etc will be walking for majority of the time. Some Amazon facilities do not have enough lockers for everyone, so prepare to leave your valuables in either at home or in your vehicle, just until you receive a locker. Overall, the Amazon pay and benefits are great!"
good,Had decent pay but environment was less than adequate. Managers attempted to be friendly and coworkers were usually less than pleasant. Overall decent place to work because of the pay and set schedule but environment didn't work for me personally
good,"Easy work, convenient schedule. Hours are decent for part time, so is pay. In and out, peak season is when you get the most hours. Good work for college kids"
good,"one of the huge ware house in BC with powerful managing ,and friendly crew . wonderful FC with good security and connection .Also verity in work shift can help to crew get rest ."
good,"Lots of people with different ideas and very innovative,advance when coming to packaging and determining which products go from one place to another."
good,I was able to learn everything in my department in a short amount time. I was able to work with friends all the time. Management didn`t know how to handle things properly. They also played favorites.
good,"They have great benefits."
good,I have learnt many interesting things as I am new to the corporate world. Good working atmosphere and its a friendly one.I have got many suggestions from the management and the team members.I was very glad to work with the senior most engineers.
good,"L'ambiente di lavoro e' dinamico, giovane, multirazziale e stimolante."
good,"Overall Amazon is okay. They work you to death and the hours suck but you have a stable, well somewhat stable, job. If you're like me with many kids it's hard to balance the job with family obligations. I worked night so it was hard to balance dr appointments, school functions with 10 hr shifts with so many hours for time off. Oh and don't get me started on the rates!! Quality or Rate! Can't have both!!"
good,Your constantly busy working in a fast pace environment. Always meeting new people and learning new departments. the benefits are very good. but work hours and all the overtime can make it very tiering at times. you must be motivated to work here
good,"The hiring process was the best part. No stressful interview and no waiting for weeks on edge worrying if you have a job or not. All you have to do is show up to scheduled appointments that you arrange online. Same thing with the actual work. Just show up and work to the best of your ability and it's a breeze, BUT they expect you to be on your feet for 10 1/2 hours and never get tired. The building is hot and by the time you use the bathroom or get to the break room it's time to turn around and get back to work. You don't have any REAL time to enjoy breaks. The majority of people there are friendly and helpful which plays a major part in making the day easier. The coffee and water are free and the vending machines have good lunch choices for fair prices. Maybe if the pay was higher(which is still good for warehouse work) and breaks were longer I could recommend this being a career. Those are the main downfalls."
good,Was a very good job. I liked it the only thing i can say is the management needs to beetter thought out. Alot of management knows less than a person thats has been working their for 2 weeks.
good,great place to work fun rewarding also exciting . Make sure to drink plenty fluids and stretch before every start day . Managers are always often very busy but great people .
good,"Good Job and great opportunity for advancement. Great benefits and Pay. Lots of incentives and giveaways. I enjoyed my time their...got my own place and car,  while finishing college."
good,Amazon is a good place to work. You will walk a lot of miles in a day. They change rate and sometimes hard to keep up with . sometimes the air conditioning goes out and nothing to do about it.
good,"Amazon is a continuous improvement environment. They stand behind their principles, one of which is dealing with ambiguity. With stock prices soaring, the prospect of receiving compensation in the form of stock, as well as competitive wages in management roles the job seems alluring. "
good,A typical day would be for me to be a slam operator. With being a slam operator I would run the line. Making sure every package is properly packed and shipped out correctly. If there was a problem with the package I would fix the problem and then ship the package to the truck.
good,"a typical day at work consist of unloading trucks in fair conditions "
good,"A typical day at work includes stand ups with your manager, it's a lot of fun. I've learned quite a few things, picking, receiving. Management is awesome, they're kind and very helpful. Co-workers are very kind and look out for one another. Hardest part of the job to be honest is the walking distance from point A to point B, but then again what did I expect from a warehouse job? The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to be there and learning new and different things everyday."
good,The management at FTW1 is dull at best and very unprofessional. The people there will start drama with anyone and i ended up seeing seeing the warehouse as high school all over again.
good,Very demanding in labor. Great coworkers. I enjoyed working there and getting a chance to be a part of amazon. I wish i would have stayed but they were unable to work with my student schedule even after i gave them a 3 weeks notice.
good,"identify and solving the problems "
good,"If you are not right on your rate they will get rid of you. The employees are very nice but management can get very on the down side. Can NOT have a Drs note, and they will get onto you about it. Its a fast pace job, and you will walk several miles a day. You will definitely lose weight. Benefits are beyond what you could ask for. If you don't make rate, they will write you up. So its a good company to work for."
good,I enjoy working here. I feel my opinion is valued and there is room for advancement. I have meet many nice people. I really like how diverse the population of employees is.
good,very fast past job on your feet 10 hours a day in a hot work place. have to be able to move fast and have to pay attention to detail on everything you do.
good,I have learned a lot about time management. Make pace and precision conciliate so your day would be count as highly productive.
good,"Great way to make money through mturk.com but you really have to dedicate yourself to make the money later on. You will get some hard jobs to begin with that are long and confusing, but then you will get a contract typist jobs occasionaly either doing transcribing videos or handwritten documents."
good,Clocking in going to the board to find what area you are working in for the day. Go to that area and start your job for the day. The most enjoyable part about the job is the people that work with you. The hardest part is the time spent away from family.
good,"I do enjoy the work at amazon, the management is very helpful and encouraging, but the work hours are too long, and there is a long amount of standing. "
good,"Amazon in general isn't a bad place to work. As long as you are perfectly fine physically or you have a documented disability. When you have a bad back like I do, but no medical waiver, it's debilitating. I was in gift wrap, but on slow days they will put you in another department if you are needed. This is where my problems arose. I was put in AFE2 on the sorter. When one of the lines backed up, I had to lift bins off the conveyor (sometimes 25 to 50lbs), and toss them on another line or on the floor. When things picked up again, the ones that were placed on the floor had to be put on the conveyor again. Imagine doing this for 11 hours on your feet the entire time. Up, down, up, down. With only two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch in between. Which are actually shorter than they sound; by the time you leave where your are and are able to get to the restroom or to clock out you have very little time left. I think I sat down for maybe 10 minutes a day. And that was to basically shove food in my mouth so I wouldn't pass out. By the time I'd leave work in the morning (I had a night shift), my feet would be swollen and purple and I could hardly move let alone stand. Most days I'd come home in tears my back ached so much. "
good,no phones lot of physical manual labor long hours no sitting. prize giveaways stock in amazon lot of job advancements and perks and incentives
good,"habe den Umgang mit Scanern gelernt"
good,"targets are impossible 12 hours and my feet were blistered, there shoes are terrible crippled me after 3 days but i kept going for 3.5 months"
good,It was a nice environment and they always had a smile on no matter how long they have been working there has been no other experience like that
good,"Days were long but rarely worked on weekends. Hourly rate was low but made plenty of overtime to compensate. Never sure if the next season would be picked up and shows only filmed for 3 months at a time. Crew was some of the best I have ever worked with. Lots of energy, fun but professional, and most importantly efficient."
good,The benefits were great. The pay was pretty good. The environment was very stressful. They expect you to do 5 things at once while they watch. Coworkers were great.
good,"We work very hard with our co-workers, and the hard part is. Getting all our pull's, and packet's out on time. We work for one of the largest internet company on line order, where all our work come's from people shopping  on line internet."
good,Good opportunities to promote up. Very busy days with amazingly smart and awesome people. Not a lot of work life balance.
good,"Its no doubt a good company to work for. However i was working on the bottom. As my department had no set place to work, even though my department was responsible for inventory control and quality assurance. A high working there was meeting a bevy of new and interesting people. A low working there was the amount of favoritism some of the managers played. I learned a lot working there and do not regret it one bit. There are so many possibilities to move up in the company if one so chooses."
good,"The people are really what make working at Amazon fun. They do need to learn to promote people who excel at their jobs. I don't believe in the whole ""Too important to promote."" thing."
good,"Amazon allows everyone to come as they are without being a static culture. There are many types of people you encounter on a day to day and management take time to listen to employees there. There's boards all around the place where you can make suggestions and get responses from Human Resources instantly. There's a great amount of time without pay you can use whenever you have to. The hardest part is the 10-hr night shift. You are allowed 3 days off, however, on the days you work, there's not much time to tend to personal needs such as food and outside pursuits after waking up from the sleep you take upon getting home (if you do not have children or another job). So far, I enjoy my management whereas, I do see many others complain. The co-workers are supportive and you can find out anything pertaining to the job if you just ask. Everyone is willing to assist."
good,It was cool and a fun learning and working experience . During work you used up a bunch of energy. The ambassadors was extremely helpful. The hardest part of that job was to just keep yourself going and stay on your feet . My most enjoyable part of the jobs was just see tons of different people working as hard as I am .
good,"My job profile was Customer service associate. "
good,"A typical day at work was busy and at times stressful. I learnt how to follow the company process paths, how to prioritise specific items and how to better communicate with my managers and team leads. My co-workers where most definitely the best part about this job, they where the reason the work was as enjoyable as it was. The most difficult task I was given was to pick a deadline pick which is a time critical collection that has to be out of the building asap."
good,"fun place to work"
good,Amazon is a good company to work. But it is not suitable to start your career. Management is friendly.
good,"A typical day at work would be fast paced right off the back"
good,you was isolated counting inventory. the hardest part was having to be to your self for 10 hours a day
good,i was always there by 6am didnt have to clock in till 6.55 id get some coffee wake up a bite then when came time i would clock in we would have a stand up meeting every morning the board would tell me which side my team was on cause there was two working sides id work on what ever side they decided.i would work for two hours as fast as i could then we'd have a fifteen minute break then work for another two hours as fast as i could then have a 30 minute lunch then after lunch wed have another stand up meeting and the board would show in numbers how good or bad we were doing as far as how fast or slow we was going when putting up items we would do our stretches then hed back out for the remainder of the day.
good,A typical day at work would be helping pack and scanning barcodes and helping people if they took to many items or having a problem in general.
good,"A typical day in ICQA includes counting bins of product. You move from sitting to standing constantly, sometimes jumping several bins and rows before coming to more work. You can walk approximately 5 miles some days. I found management did a poor job of communicating policy changes, which were frequent. Management did not communicate to employees in an appropriate manner at times. Despite that, I found my coworkers to be very friendly and inviting. They were quick to greet and bring in new employees. Very helpful and considerate. The most enjoyable part of the job was doing indirect functions, whenever you could get placed in them. It did seem at times as if the same people did the same functions everyday."
good,"First of all i would have to scan in, and log into the scanner. The scanner then would tell me where to go and which item to pic up. id go to the required row and then pick the item up, check for any damage and then scan it. "
good,The company provided a variety of restaurants with great food
good,I really enjoyed working at Amazon. My Co-Workers have been just like a family.
good,"Long hours and fast paced environment"
good,they treat you like a slave its only good for the money not a career
good,A typical day started at 6:30am. Learned very good safety tips everyday. Their are Wonderful Managers there to help you in anyway. My co-workers were amazing. Hardest part of my job was the heavy boxes if they were not stacked correctly.
good,Walk around with your radio active gun scanning packages picking up 20-50lbs packages placing them in my cart and on to the next on thie list.
good,"the people there are friendly, its alot different from zappos that is for sure"
good,"a typical day would just be picking all day, having SMALL talk with coworkers while performing your job IF they are picking where you happen to be picking because of the high productivity level they constantly inform you about. they hire almost anyone, so based on how you are you can either choose to keep to yourself or try to make friends within the short break periods. i've never been hurt on the job so i couldnt tell you how the health benefits are but a coworker i knew told me that they set up a doctors appointment and he didnt have to come out of his pocket for it. but like i said the best part is seeing the check every week."
good,"Its a comfortable Job with Day shift and Shuttle facilities. I have learnt a lot of Supply chain process in Amazon.com and mainly works on the High Prioirty Tasks called Andon Cord and focus mainly on fixing customer issues. "
good,excellence in monotony is known as operations.Extremely true when u work for Amazon.Same work can be refined each and every day and the bar on quality and productivity is impeccably high.Everyone in Amazon can deliver when required. Pretty awesome culture.
good,"fast paced environment,meet many new employees, great opportunities for growth and advancement."
good,This is a very good place to work. They pay very well and set goals that the average person off the street can meet.
good,"Working at Amazon was an enjoyable experience. Learning new things with positive co-workers surrounding you, motivating you to work harder."
good,The only thing is you never have the chance to sit down. Pretty much all the time is standing and moving quick.
good,"Amazon is not such a bad job especially if you need some money. Getting paid every week is worth it in the end. Working there twice, I learned of two different jobs and the standards to meet. Some of the co-workers are not some to obilge. There is always someone that may catch an attitude for no apparent reason. The hardest part of the job is standing for 9 hours with a 1 hour break split 3 ways. Overall it is something to act upon but after a while it may not be for some individuals."
good,"I was hired to work at Amazon through Integrity Staffing Solutions, Amazon is their only client. I thought I was on my way to being hired as a Amazon associate. However despite being trained on Clamp-truck two days before I was let go on December 21st. It wasn't just me of the 250 employees working through Integrity all but 4 were let go that day."
good,It’s an okay job I’ve worked there for a while now and still haven’t been hired on can’t listen to music and you walk alone all day/night... They say 15 minute breaks but expect it takes 5 mins to get to where you want for break and they expect you to be back on time
good,"Consistently inhouse hiring for management, hr, etc, great day one benefits,  easy but repetitive work and guaranteed hours. They help you further your education in any field and have many opportunities"
good,This would have been a fantastic place to work if they would have paid better. Unfortunately the pay was not very good so I had to move on but I did like my time here
good,"Fast place to work. Always target .... people dont really care about rules , how should to put products on the right place . Then if you need that place is always difficult to find. It was one group people who cooperate to get good black basked to stowing for themselves and yellow always left for you. That's why you always worked more harder than them to get this target ...unfortunately after Xmas out"
good,"Amazon is a great place to work, the benefits are the best. I just personally feel like they let people go for the slightest reasons. Also, the temp agencies they partner with ; they treat the temp employees as if they aren't as good as the workers that are permanent."
good,My overall experience was great. I love the benifits and the fast pace. Until they lied about me and said that I was in conflict and would check cameras to prove I wasn't.
good,"Working in the warehouse you had harsh targets to reach, which were hard to reach based on various circumstances. The people there were really nice to be around thoughj"
good,"You are expected to do rapid fire customer service calls with very short breaks (aside from the hour for lunch which was nice) You literally can barely leave your desk even after a very stressful call. They do give you the tools to decompress and destress but you have NO TIME TO DO ANYTHING. On top of that you have managers and upper level people listening in on every single call you make, pointing out every single mistake you make. It is a very high stress environment. I will never go back"
good,Depending on your job duty this job can be mentally draining as well as physical . In addition they don't always communicate effectively. However the company pay is good.
good,It was ok. My ambassador was great!. She really made sure we new what we are doing. She stuck with us thru out the first  2 weeks. The first two weeks is TOUGH on your body. I mean tough. I was all kinds of sore. Not for the lazy or elderly.  You work a full 10 hour shift. Breaks are very short way to short.  Seasonal get stuck doing all the picking(grunt work).  Numbers are key to advance.   Its hard to make rate at times. I did but still wasnt hired . Inwas always at 90% and above.  OT is nice made lots of money. HR is a joke !!!!! They point you for everything so you have to open a hr case .to have it fixed.
good,Amazon Was very unorganized and there was no room to grow. Although the pay was great I personally felt very replaceable. It was hard to find a manager that would actually help
good,"Got to learn a lot at early stages , management needs to  bring in  more transparency regarding promotion process, job got its own perks but cons like no career advancement ,monotonous and boring"
good,"Amazon has great benefits and hourly pay for their workers, however working there was a bit stressfuls. My job as a picker at Amazon was very physically demanding. I had to work fast to keep my rate high and to get orders send down to Outbound. After working a full 10 hour shift there my body would be very sore but I had to get up the next morning to do it all over again. I used to love listening to music while working but they took that privilage away. Once we had a new district manager everything changed alot. It was hard for me to get into a higher ranking job. Sometimes they would place new employees to go straight into training for a new job before they'll pick someone who worked there for a year (me)."
good,"Good Job for the money.You spend most of your time here so everyone here dates someone here and most area have cliques like back in high school. They have cute activities each week, like pajama day, silly hat day, mustache etv etc."
good,"Its a fun place to work at. people who works there are very friendly and helpful. It requires a lot of hard work. I feel that amazon pays you less for the amount of work you do there,"
good,This job was hard work! loved the fast pace environment and the co-workers and diversity made this job so much fun. I would recommend this job to anyone who likes to get paid to work out 10 hours a day. I was in the best shape of my life. The work/ life balance is hard to get use to but the pay and benefits are there.
good,"Its good, very fast paced sometime but very relaxed also. You have alot of room to grow and relocate if you wish to you just need to have a degree to move forward."
good,"I worked as a customer service agent/call centre agent and my typical day at work would consist of a handful or two of irate customers which eventually became normal to me. It can be stressful when a customer doesn't understand the policies or when there aren't solutions that will satisfy the customer. However, I would always get the same customer issue 85% of the time so it made things easier. I learned that every customer is going to be unpredictable and that its important to stay calm for their sake. It puts the customer at ease and gives them the impression that you have everything under control. Management was a pleasure to work with. They were great mentors and they really helped me grow in the company and as a person.They also encouraged me to have an open mind when dealing with customers and their problems. The workplace culture was somewhat fun. I enjoyed going to work and being among my colleagues. I felt really comfortable and motivated being around them. The hardest about my job was definitely my shift. At Amazon, at least 80% of the employees work night shift due to the time difference. Working night shift often made me ill and I therefore had to leave because my health was at risk. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team gatherings. Team gatherings taught me a lot with regards to new methods, communication tips during calls, short cuts when composing emails. Overall, this company has shaped me into a person I never imagined being. I've definitely grown, become a lot more confident, driven, outgoing, open-minded and wiser."
good,"Where I worked at, I worked about 20-30 hours a week. They are improving management and there is advancement if you are interested in doing so. I did not advance because the hours did not caught my attention. Sometimes during the seasons, it is pretty slow for a time, but there are times that each day you come to work, it is busy and there is work to do. Sometimes a little stressful but you don't need to work too hard. The worst thing I would say is poor pallet building, but that is up to the individual to improve that skill. Great benefits, especially if you want to go to school."
good,Amazon is a good place to work. They provide a lot of benefits as well as adequate training to they’re employees in order to ensure success in their field of choice.
good,"Hard working people will love this job, offers good benefits, and time options, fast paced environment, night shift is a little harder than nights, but you can always transfer"
good,"The culture at an Amazon warehouse is amazing. But here is a warning: this job is not for the weak. You have to be on your stuff or its very possible to get the boot aka FIRED. Expect to feel like you're going to die a the end of every shift before your three weeks mark. After that, it's pretty easy. Awesome people, awesome pay. You don't get much time off, but you can take lots of partial days or plan to leave early. It's pretty cool."
good,it was fun keeping up with the qoute that they set to pull a night the clocking in and out was i little hard because you had to wait in line to get to the clock
good,"Amazon is a great place to work, it’s fast paced, many good challenges, many different people big on diversity. They cross train you, there is a heavy teamwork culture. You get a different assignment everyday , so it’s not boring. "
good,Un travail compliqué sans avoir l’air du à la belle cohésion au sein de l’entreprise
good,"Great place to work for and their benefit are great. The increased minimum wage has motivated many  Americans to take a career with Amazon, especially now that they offer career choices"
good,Interesting place to work. One day might be very easy and smooth. The next day might be a little more difficult. You never know until you get to your section.
good,"The people, pay and benefits were great! However, we spend most of our time by ourselves and there are no windows, natural light, or anyone to talk to so it sometimes feels like jail."
good,"I worked there for a year and a half. The benefits are great and the work is easy. They tend to hire too many new people though and then go crazy trying to pin the veteran people on anything they can.  If you speak english, you will be a minority at this job, and the rules will apply more so to you than anyone else but it's honestly either dumb luck or something stupid you did, if you get fired."
good,"I have learned a lot about the process of Amazon, which has been absolutely fascinating, but I will say this job is very repetitive and you are confined to one work station per day. In my case I like to move around a lot so this hasn't been the most enjoyable job for me, but the managers are wonderful and so are the benefits! I also love that this job is 4, 10 hour shifts instead of 5, 8 hour shifts so you enjoy a long weekend. Overtime I would say is available half of the year, along with under a sixth of it being mandatory, so if you are a workaholic, you may not ALWAYS get the option of overtime."
good,I was pregnant and it was time for my maternity leave. My case manager never answered the phone and amazon fired me. They said since my maternity leave was never initiated it seemed like I was just missing work. After speaking with h.r through email ONLY. (I was never given a number to call) they told me there was nothing they could do and I could reapply in one year.
good,once employed you learn the time you invest is  the kind  of  investment you see in a check  Youre almost able to work from a full  day  to an half  day of  work not un less things have changed
good,It was a good starter's experience. I didn't get to interact with people much as we were all busy.  It was great to see how a giant operation looked like from inside. I definitely enjoyed working there.
good,Amazon is a great company to work for but it isnt for everyone. If you aren't active before working there you will have a hard time adjusting. You need to have a go get it attitude to advance in the company. Go to work not to socialize. Be willing to learn new things and volunteer for whatever you can. Take advantage of all that Amazon has to offer.
good,If you are able to invent and simplify process and deliver results in ur basic work for consistantly 6 months..you can expect growth. But the requirement of monthly scorecard makes it difficult to stay in top 2 amongst your team. Thereby reducing chances for growth.
good,Long hours but adequate pay for low skill work. Mandatory overtime was called for about a month straight but it was good for me as I was willing to work as much as possible.
good,"A great job for the interim was exactly what i needed at the time and then some. Although it was only a job to aquire enough money to move me and my family back to Texas where we have a support system, the job itself was exactly what i needed at the time."
good,"When working at Amazon I loved my job and had fun almost every single day I worked there. The only issue I had while I was there was an HR policy agreement. Overall, a very good place to work."
good,Good pay and benefits as well as great people to work with. Limited amount of time off even if it was an emergency. Hitting you numbers everyday was a challenge but it was a challenge I was up to achieving.
good,I think letting us listening to music would help improve rates. Hearing that beeping noise from the scanner can feel very depressing.  I just need music
good,"One thing that they don't tell you when getting hired on is how ""cut-throat"" it is trying to get shifts at Amazon. They have over 200 employees and only post about 70-90 shifts per week. So, they're gone fast."
good,Impossible to do? We have limited time at Amazon that we can miss and what not and that it was hard for me because I was on night shift and was fired for not having time.
good,When I joined Amazon it was fun working here but in the last few months the environment has changed drastically. No more a fun working organization anymore.
good,"My typical day at work is roll call and receiving information. Management was not easy to talk to about issues or problems and were not always available. The job was not complicated at all. The most enjoyable part was being recognized and rewarded when you though no one noticed. Overall, it was an ok place to work for. Good benefits and rewards."
good,You should be hard working and energetic because they have long working hours with non stop moving. Wish they pay the lunch break since they have really very shory breaks for a long period of time working per day. Plus since there is quota for your quarterly rating you cant even leave work and go to the restroom.
good,"going in was easy. very fun in the start. keeping up the rate can be hard for stowing or mostly anywhere in amazon, stowing is pretty much standing up for a10 hr shift putting items in these containers and you gotta make them fit big items or small items. each item is 1 and to be at a good rate of 150 items an hour. i left cause other departments had it more easy than others, people in a different area didnt need a rate like we did they were more relaxed while others struggled more, we had cameras on us 24/7 (stowing) while others didnt even have that. i did both jobs so i know. if you arent fast paced they will terminate you"
good,"Horaires correct, les chefs sont à l'écoute le travail en lui même ma plus."
good,"If this had been 30 years ago,I would still be there.But being older ,some exercises are not as simple to execute than when I was in my teens.But I was fortunate to work for an otherwise great company."
good,It was an ok place to work. The pay wasn't that great though. The hours you would get would not that good either if you are looking for a job to live off of.
good,amazon is Very Worked based they are more on productivity then anything. The mangers are good and nice. the job is semi hard not a lot but once you get in the grove you should be good to go.
good,"Amazon is fun, A lot of people are willing to help you out the deal with their insurance and stocks. If it wasn't for the salary cap I wouldn't be looking for another job. I think they try to place blame  a lot on someone at all times rather than just fix the problem that would be my only con."
good,"there is no more challenging work. its fun but not productive. we can make some money but no personal growth like knowledge wise. For me there is no job satisfaction. i can not learn some new thing after certain time. In my life i want to do something new everyday, every time some innovative or impressive so all time i am finding some challenging work for me."
good,not a bad place to work  great benefits and retirement guaranteed 40 hours only problem is the grunt work is rough so work hard and shoot for management less work more pay.
good,"Amazon is a fast paced job, overall it does get tiring but if your looking for a decent hourly rate and hours its a good job. Once you are there for a certain amount of time you can get benefits."
good,"Overall Amazon is a good company to work for with great pay and benefits. However, you are required to work long hours and doing a lot manual labor. The management here is good and supportive of their employees."
good,I learn a lot of things on there. The only thing I believe is unfair is the salary and the times for brakes and lunch that is not sufficient when you have to live your station and come back too fast and chronometer. if your break room is 5 min far of your station and you have 15 min as a brake you will get just 5 min for break.
good,"The job was very repetitive, you do the exact same thing every day, and I usually came home with sore feet/legs because of the excessive walking every day. The breaks were too short considering the break rooms locations to where we worked."
good,"Work starts right after a 10 minute meeting you have everyday informing you of how much product you will be working with for the day or night, stretches, and a remind to stay hydrated. You get a 30 minute break but their is only part-time work at the location i worked. Once you work there for 90 days yo get your benefits, and after a year they will do tuition reimbursement for you."
good,"This is an outstanding company to work for if you don't mind working 80+ hours/week.  Everyone is very talented and I got the opportunity to work on projects that are changing the retail and logistics landscape.  I believe the work we were doing in AMZL to build out the last-mile delivery network will studied in business schools for years to come.  I just couldn't keep up with all the long hours and always being expected to respond, even at 2am. Never being able to disconnect is physically and emotionally draining."
good,"I  liked working here because of the hours, i had plenty of days to do what I wanted. But, the only serious issue with Amazon  centers as a whole is that a manager doesn't terminate you, a computer does. This is where you can get fired if you don't buckle down and get those rates that the system wanted you to have. its pretty cut throat. But if you can survive that then you can thrive here with flying colors and move up to like ambassador positions. Oh, and benefits are VERY good."
good,I worked very hard but I was disliked by management and I had to put my 2-week notice in before I could find another place of employment I really enjoyed working for Amazon but the management there made t very hard for me to stay
good,"Fast pace, rate is a big issue and if you don't make it don't plan on staying long. They don't like employees taking bathroom breaks or getting something to drink in even when its hot. Only plus is 4 days a week sometimes 5. Vacation time is nice!"
good,Over everything I've done with Amazon I do think it was a good work environment. They kept everyone on their toes and always had work to do. If you worked on a holiday they made sure that your hours were accounted for and they kept the day pretty light as far as work goes. The hardest part of working for amazon was hitting the high number of product they have set for each person.
good,Product managers might not be very cooporative. Work-life balance is OK. Parties and perks are very good. Over-all it was a good enough experience though the work was boring.
good,The break room was a great place with a hot chocolate machine. It also had snack machines which contained just about almost anything. I also really enjoyed the days when they brought in donuts
good,its okay 
good,"People can only work here if they can take lifting boxes, and physically demanding task. It is busy on some days and slow on other days. Always keep water on you because you will get thirsty really fast. The work culture is decent depending on if you like a fast paced environment, and working with many different people. The hardest part of the job was being able to move up position wise. Everything else at amazon I could honestly say I personally enjoyed."
good,This is a pretty cool job but it is only part time. You will not be able to afford to live on your own. In my opinion it gets kind of boring but it is a fast paced environment.
good,"Long straining workdays. "
good,"Amazon was good to work at and the people are helpful and they work with you. I learned how to work as a team with other people , and was also given plenty of room to grow."
good,"Some days the work was rough due to shortage of workers, and we never got that gaming room that we were told about designing but you get to work out and know a lot of kind people"
good,"1)Typical day: Good,fun"
good,"Fast pace "
good,"It’s a great place to work at. I think the location I was at wasn’t the best though. It also depends on what team your with. The team I was on was not motivational and worked you so hard with out even saying thank you for your hard work. I was known as a counter and usually they don’t even care about you. It was a great experience, just wish I was placed somewhere else."
good,No raises fast workplace I didn't move working there I didn't like that u could have the experience in loading or forklift operator and they would place you in an with positions
good,"I work at Amazon right now. It's not a horrible place, good part time benefits. Lack of hours and advancement opportunities. Great managers. Come in do your work, work hard and go home. Most employees are very friendly. Good for students and those who want a good part time job with benefits."
good,Work life balance is an issue because I work night shift. Great opportunity for me to be in the field of human resources. Very fast paced and will challenge you!
good,"Your experience vastly depends on the people you work with and your attitude. First thing, it's not the easiest job to handle physically and mentally, especially on christmas prime. You walk for almost 11 hours, so you have to find your own way to enjoy this place. Obviously you'll get mad at the beginning since it's a huge corporation with a target to earn as much money as possible so they keep a lot of information low key, but once you adapt to a few things its not that bad."
good,"a typical day at work is working in competition for rates, i learned that everything is in fast pace mode and you loose time when you go to the bathroom and workplace culture is all types. The hardest part of the job is making the rate when is very slow. The most enjoyable thing about the job is you win prizes."
good,Not a bad place to start if you have never been in a warehouse setting. step by step training on how to use equipment and such. if youre a veteran it might seem redundant to work here but the pay is worth it. not bad place to start.
good,Very easy not hard at all amazon is kind like s big shoot every on talks and gossip and it u can get over that than y’all be fine work life ain’t hard
good,Amazon has a fast paced working environment. You have to stay focused and scan a certain amount of boxes in a given time. During peak it an be stressful but when everyone comes together it's manageable. The hardest part of working here was the strain it put on your body. Other than that the job was easy to learn.
good,"The job working at amazon wasn't a difficult one per say, as in there wasn't much to it but to count all day. There were numbers to meet however which was no problem aside from me not wanting to be in a enviroment like that."
good,Scan items place on shelf.stowing began .having a meeting.in tha circle.checking in with problem solver when .problem accures..managment was ok.But confussing.nice employees to work with. .Hardest part.not getting tiered.over fusstrating.meeting new employee s.That was willing to help.
good,"I would say every day is the first day on Amazon. You really never know what you are going to be walking into. Somedays are better than others. But for the most part, you walk in go to stand up listen to what is going on for that day then clap out and go find a station. Log in and start sorting your boxes so you can make rate. The rate is the about of items you sort per hour. They also keep raising this the more records we break during peak season. I would have to say I loved working at Amazon when I first started but now I just hate going to work. It's not the same management is always changing and there is no discipline for people that do bad things."
good,"The overall work was not bad, but the long hours combine with the repetitive work made it unbearable to me."
good,"They worked you hard, there was some great benefits but you worked until you dropped, its why they had a first aid area with trained staff at all times to deal with mostly heat exhaustion as you would be working hard and in the summer it got really warm in there. The Pay was pretty good but pretty rough work conditions and even if you advanced it didn't get any easier."
good,Not a good place of organization. Very cold during winter months. Breaks are only 10 min and 24 for lunch. They take 2.5 min to walk to and from break into the allotted 15 min break we're supposed to have as well as lunch.
good,Overall I liked working at Amazon things changed their everyday . But it was kinda like a sweat shop they would throw out a number or quota you had to make everyday if not you might get retained or fired.Its more of and job for students right out of high school .
good,When I clocked in for work it made me learn that you should always meet with your team to talk about your gameplay. Then breakup and completely the daily objective
good,"Able to adapt to any change in role or responsibility given."
good,"Con ilusión ingrese en Amazon El Prat BCN1 a traves de Adecco. La ilusión me duró 8 días ya que me despidieron por no pasar el periodo de prueba. ¿Por qué? Segun las valoraciones por falta de productividad y no estar a la altura de la calidad exigida."
good,"I really cannot say much here, still disclosed on nature of work."
good,got my scan gun got on either cherry picker or reach truck pulled orders and drop off at the right location. work the belt by breaking down pallets and loading the belt with product to sorted out
good,I scanned barcodes all night; management needs some work especially communicating with each other and relaying information to employees; there isn't anything hard about working at amazon but I really miss working with the group of people that I worked with.
good,This job is okay but I want to be able to pursue my dream and help children. This job was just to make some money and figure out what was next in my working life.
good,Enter at an exact time and exit at an exact time unless flex up is announced which makes everyone stay an extra hour optional only if you have personal time to waste.
good,The work is made for a fast pace worker who can stand for long periods of the day to complete the job. It is truly a competitive task force because you have to compete against other amazon buildings in other states.
good,"They were good with school and accommodating with my schedule and paying with my tuition. Other than that, it was like every warehouse but with no raises."
good,"Hello Sir, I am very busy with my work. You give me a chance. I will do my best work and I will show you how I work.                                 ."
good,"amazon was not a good place to work, because everything was about rate and in my opinion they dont care much about the employees or how we feel long as we get the job done"
good,the day usually starts off slow until first break then starts speeding up after the last break. ive learned how everything moves and how the conveyors work.
good,"Amazon has OUTSTANDING benefits, but I do not agree with how they work us. You stand in your own little ""cage"" the whole shift, working. They say you cannot speak, but if you find a friend by you, time goes by faster. It is not a hard job at all! Just very dreading, drives you insane. You'll spend time contemplating on life the whole time :)"
good,My overall experience working here was OK. They had a amazing lunch area. The managers there were very nice and willing to help when things went wrong.
good,"It was a long and hard journey knowing right from the start ""flex"" stands for short term. As a contractor carrier its a risk-but i was able to completing any task that was handed out to me. Surly, I have taken a good amount of experience away from this program and have improve my personal timing record -with each assignment i might add. In conclusion, you might see me popping on the grid here and there to collect a few digits -but  its not a solution what I've been looking for and so others will have there chances. AS for me, it's time to move on."
good,"Became experienced in the shipping and handling department, lifting 30 Ibs or more on a daily basis, learning how to deal with multiple machines. long break periods were very nice."
good,They care more about numbers than they do about the employees that work there. The perks were amazing and not too many full-time opportunities. 3/5 Might work there again.
good,Hours usually go by rather quickly. This company helped me cooperate much better with other people. Managers were kind and helpful in providing tips to employees on how to be more productive.
good,I have worked for amazon for 2 years on night shift and currently looking for a day job. I have worked with parcels dealing with damaged parcels to picker packer to physical work.
good,Job would've been better if everyone was on one accord.... Management showed favoritism.... Staff had drama as well as associates needed more structure
good,Had to move towns.  To long of a driving distance for me. Had to get a closer job. So i quit. Typical days i was packing not doing ti much. I was on great terms with everybody there
good,I'm required to work 5 days a week for 5 hours a day. Management has there picks and the customer is more important than the employee. Absolutely any one can be hired!
good,I have been with Amazon for 6 months it's a great place to be most of the time is just too much walking you walk 10 hours a day and the bathrooms are too far but it's okay it can be better
good,I did work for Amazon last Christmas and realy enjoys it. It was fast paced and felt I was always kept busy so made time fly by and also was a realy good rate of pay.
good,A good place to work with great benefits and great hours. The pay is good you start at 12 an hour with a .25 raise after 6 months and then it progresses from there ever 6 month
good,"Long work hours, mandatory overtime.  As far as pay goes its a decent job, with good benefits.  But if you have children i would not recommend working for Amazon."
good,"I really appreciate all the benefits this job has to offer, I also enjoy the salary but it hard work. What I mean by hard work is this job is physically demanding. It really is hard on the body. If you are a student looking into this job I would say good luck, it is little difficult managing this job and school. Either than this job being physically demanding, the people are friendly, the management team is helpful and are as understanding as they can be. I wouldn't say don't apply but I am going to say just realize that this takes a lot out of you physically and just to be cautious of that."
good,Entreprise et management très correct dans l'ensemble.
good,"The managers are great to work for. Very professional. The work can be very boring. You do the same thing the entire shift, every stift. Great benefits and the company truly cares about the employees.  You can move p if you remain in good standing and you have the desire."
good,"Interesting culture, fast pace company and provide limitless career opportunities provided that you willing to work hard and give your best. Culturally, very relaxing and easy going environment."
good,"Lots of walking or standing"
good,"The pay was good but the hours were long and the work was tough. Overall for my first time working at a proper workplace, it was good and I liked working night shifts."
good,"Typical day at work included picking items to be delivered to customers"
good,"I would recommend this company to anyone who wants a chance for advancement and the chance to further their education.  Once I complete 1-2 years, I am entitled to enroll in courses offered such as nursing."
good,"an typical day at work consists on laughter,hard work...they cant keep management. the hardest part of the job is finding an place for an big item to fit when the facility is 90% full"
good,everyday same work its a bit hard but i am use to it now i workd in amazon overe every christmes when they needed people because i was steal studing i only could do part time management was nice and good not any problems at all.
good,"Nice enviroment to work in, makes you step out of your comfort zone, diversity environment, opportunity to learn different equipment, opportunity to move up"
good,It was alright I didn't really enjoy standing that long of a time but the pay was good. It was a lot of people and the parking lot got crammed. They are on tot about it numbers
good,"Average Amazonian works 10 hour shifts, must be on the floor for a mini meeting (one before shift begins and one after lunch). Whatever department you are in, you must scan your badge (most likely to a computer) within a certain time to begin work. "
good,A typical work day at amazon would include packing items one by one in the right size boxes and printing out the delivery address. I learned how to pack items according to their size and weight. There was always a manager present to overlook everything. My co-workers had their own work stations so we couldn't distract anyone and we could work at our own pace. The hardest part of the job was picking up all the heavy items to pack and the most enjoyable part of the job was the hours.
good,"handling business at work, some how a person needed help on their scanner, I patiently stop and ask where he ok and he said no, so I ended up fixing the problem it took a little minute but I got it and I leaned u never to good to help someone, moral of story guy had to much time off task,"
good,Fast pace workplace with music and air conditioning and clean break rooms with flat screen televisions. the bathrooms are clean and have a chart that tells you if you are dehydrated or not. High security when you take your break and lunch and when you go home. Different back grounds and cultures and most of the time everyone gets along.
good,Love the atmosphere overall but can be quite stressful because I was given many tasks at one time and had little to no help
good,"my veiw on amazon was very closed in ,not open minded & made me extremely tired and sore .I Really think that job should only be for men, but I also did meet some great people at the job I also made great money there but I would ever work in the facility again ."
good,"If you are married and have kids, to add them to your health care will cost $700-$900 a month. ON top of that it has a $500 per person per year deductible. Car plan is bad. No real bonus program for doing well in the field. If you don't have a call at say 330, they will give you a call that will take and hour to drive to, leaving less than 30min to deal with it. They expect you to deal with dispatch prior to 8 which is illegal since you are off the clock. They really don't know what they are doing. I've never thought it was a good ideal to make a field tech a service manager, it's rare when they make a good manager. They tend to forget what the field was like, they probably couldn't meet the goals they set. Just stay away from this company. Frankly, forklift drivers can make more and it'd be less stressful"
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at Amazon was the experience and meeting some many good people from different background and culture, Another great thing was learning the process of how a huge company becomes so successful."
good,amazon is good. I think that they should come up with a better way to pick out the hard working inbound workers and give them higher positions inthe company but over all amazon is a great company.
good,I enjoy my time with Amazon just wish I could switch shifts instead of night shift weekends I sadly never have time with my family.
good,I was a stower so I would get a cart of items and scan them into bins I love working at amazon for their benefits but not so much with the managers. They hire fresh out of college students to become managers with or without experience in previous jobs.
good,"I love this place. I like that it is a work at your own pace, I like the fast pace they have the quota. It is an amazing place to wok to me"
good,"The typical day at Amazon includes repetition and day full of co-workers. Co-workers become family and make the long hours easier to get through. Management is very organized and they help you when you are in need. That is, if you can keep rate. I guess the most enjoyable part was that the jobs were really easy and your schedule is pretty set. Plus, you normally always get your 40+ hours. For the most part it's been one of my favorite jobs."
good,"have to pick 1200 items at the end of shift."
good,I had fun my co-workers there.  I made the job fun and made people around me laugh.  It was good times even though the job sucked.  It is an all or nothing environment so you either love it or you hate it
good,A very good place to work at. my job role is to pick a variety of products and put them onto a conveyor. the hardest part of the job is walking around to much for 10 hours. its a very good job and there are a lot of other amazing people who work as well.
good,"A typical day at Amazon Fullfillment Center is very busy and rushed. You have a certain amount of time to do EVERYTHING. My job was to pick. I was to pick certain items that my scanner told me to pick from certain bins and put them in a tote. After that tote was full I was to put another tote on top of that and when that one was full as well I had to take them to a conveyor belt and send them off to packing. Amazon is a well known website. You can order ANYTHING from there and get it in a good time. My co-workers, the ones I knew anyway were very nice. But I only knew a few. You don't really have time to ""get to know"" anyone other than on your lunch and that was only 30 minutes. Overall, the job was good. I just didn't think it was for me. The most enjoyable part about it was that I knew I was getting the customer exactly what they wanted in the time that they wanted it."
good,"Awesome place to work."
good,"I am assigned to a line and a zone; I pick my numbers and scan each box to the correct pallet. I learned how to build and wrap pallets."
good,"one thing you got is job security their always work."
good,"From start to finish, every day at Amazon was almost exactly the same. This is common for warehouse/factory work, but I felt like the employees at Amazon are under-appreciated for the dedication and degree of work that we were forced to put in. I felt like they turned employees into drones, so to speak. The management was very available if there was an issue, but they were not very understanding as far as non work-related issues went. For the most part, the coworkers were very arrogant if they had been there for a while and often looked down upon new hires, instead of raising them up and helping them learn and adapt to the job. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the rates of production that we were expected to accomplish, however, Amazon offered great benefits and opportunities, if you put in the time to achieve them."
good,"Packed orders, pick orders from the bins i had a great management teams and my co workers was great and walked all day get and putting orders in the belt"
good,My typical day at work was stretching before going onto the floor to do my work. I learned how to stock alot of products and items. The management was fairly nice. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the requirements they kept changing. The most enjoyable part of this job was the pay.
good,"Typically on an average day at work, I would walk between 15 and 20 miles which was the hardest part about the job."
good,I can say it's a nice working environment. spacious something that enjoyable when working in some warehouses this one I recommend to others
good,Long hard hours but ok company to work for.  needs to communicate more with employees
good,A typical day at work is constant movement. The managers are all approachable. The hardest part is lifting heavy items. The best part is off season they VTO a lot.
good,The hours are long but they go by so fast on certain days.Working in a warehouse I got a chance to meet people of all races and learned a little from all of them.
good,"Fast pace workplace, with alot of safety involved.  you learn quickly that rules can change daily."
good,"You have to pick,pack an ship customer orders to go out for the day."
good,"End of the day, I was satisfied with my job at Amazon - an awesome place to work"
good,I loved it there. It was a good place too work and the people are AMAZING!!!
good,I loved working here and I wish I could’ve stayed. I did everything I could when I got sick to make sure that k could continue working here. But it wasn’t sufficient and even my dad didn’t had never heard of what they needed me to apply for just to be out sick.
good,"Whether Amazon is good to work for all depends on city laws and management."
good,"Great company to work for! The flexible schedule is awesome!! It’s fast pace, which I love and the manager keeps us motivated and make our job exciting"
good,I loved the fact the benefits were available immediately.You can work doubles to shorten your work days.The fact you get a weekly pay check is a bonus
good,"It was an ok job. Benifits are worth it I guess. Really wasn't my cup of tea, but if you prefer working hard for hours straight its a great opportunity."
good,"Les leadears son agreable, explique bien les choses rien a dire, le travail en lui même n’est pas compliqué mais juste physique"
good,the job was so fun and productive at first but management changed and everything just got frustrating which made a lot of people quit which made the remaining associates have a heavy workload
good,"Stressful environment, goal oriented. Long hours of continuous work."
good,No privacy between employees and Human Resources the facility needs better leaders too many people want to be the boss. The facility is not fair at all
good,Anfang der Arbeit gibt es eine Besprechung.
good,"Very strict on attendance, will fire you for one small violation that may not even be your fault, benefits on day one, good pay and shift premium, raise every six months, no phones while working whatsoever, pto, upt, and vacation time on day one, mainly 10 hour work days besides peak season (up to 12 hour work days), heavy lifting, must hit quota or you will get wrote up or possibly fired"
good,I loved this job. It was a wonderful place to work. I liked that you got to do your own thing. Must be a self-starter and motivator. Must not be opposed to change.
good,"Very physical but not impossible , pay is too low for the amount of responsibilities and work , you pretty much hace 100 stops , and alot of driving through extreme weather ... great job though but pay ain't good"
good,It’s the first time the I see a company that love to empathize about the safety of the workers. The managers help you to be successful and achieve any goals.
good,Great environment to work at especially afte the expansion and the new air units for the summer time definitely improved on the overall temperature of the facility
good,"The job at amazon was really great while I wasn't in school, when I started school in the fall that's when it got difficult. You choose your own hours and you got ovetime for certain holidays that you worked. My experience wasn't the best when they started asking for 40 hours a week and im also a full time student, that got really difficult so I resigned."
good,Amazon is a good company need to get better with the employees and work with them more. Less hours and more encouragement on work skills and a chance to associate with the staff.
good,they only start at $15 an hour. then after 6 months only a $0.20 raise. No room for advancement until you work there a full year. So your stuck waiting till then.
good,"a typical day at work at amazon is extremely long and constant standing. I learned to never look at the clock and always stay busy, but never overwork yourself."
good,"Fast paced environment, stressful but the money is good. the lunches were cheap and they give you free Christmas dinner. It is very stressful because they always pull you about everything you do even if its your first day."
good,"My experience working in Amazon uk was really good, the mostt of the employee's are friendly i it made fell good, i just change my job because i was moving to another city."
good,Area managers and PAs deeply cared about employees. Incredible discounts and benefits. Unfortunately I couldn't keep up with the ever increasing workload.
good,"Typical day: Busy"
good,I quickly advanced from associate to process assistant( assistant manager). There is lots of room for advancement at amazon. If you take the time to get to know and communicate with management they are very helpful and will have your back.
good,"I believe the environment is enjoyable, fair, and positive. Management should let associates have more of a voice, so their can understanding amongst some."
good,"I only worked weekends and everyday when i went to work they never had a station open for me i was a picker and they expected us to select 400 items an 1hour,"
good,"Depending on the job you have or the manager that you end up with, will determine how the day would go. You are doing one job everyday, if you are lucky enough, you will get to be switched to do different jobs every once in a while."
good,"Always have OT available and the majority of people are friendly and helpful. "
good,If the hours were shorter the job would have been ideal. I loved my managers and the personnel there with the exception of a few coworkers. The hardest part of the job was the wear on my body along with my mental status. I loved the independence though. We controlled our own hours and pace for the most part.
good,Is very stressful job. If you work in pack flow you have to do 270 item per hour if you don’t they give it to you a warning. Full Time position is 10hr 9 of does 10 is stand up
good,It’s a lot of work and long hours but good pay. They have people running from one thing to another and it’s always cold. They should put a five day 8 hours and not 10 hours and 4 day and you finish very painful and tried
good,"El ambiente con compañeros es excelente, solo que no tenian bien planeado la hora de las rutas para ir a entregar las paqueterias"
good,Wish it was more hours and more advancements. The managers are ok but sometimes workers do not light to help others achieve company. The work is not hard but some of the boxes can be a little heavy at times
good,It was a nice job had great co workers nice majangers the schedule was accomdating. They did stretches everyday told us how many boxes we had for the day vendin machines and clean bathrooms.
good,"good overall. Delivery is amazing, customer service is amazing. Only issue are returns which should come with a sticky label instead of me having to print them."
good,"Working at Amazon was simple and fun. I had a lot of coworkers from around the world. I learned how hard working Amazon as a company really is and the hardest part of the job was equipment failure and that it was a long drive. I really liked it there so I don't have anything bad to say. Other than when the belts were malfunctioning or the system crashed, the company had great benefits, and treated employees with respect."
good,"You start the day by doing stretching excerises to help when lifting heavy boxes,then you go on line to scan items to be put in bins. The bins are then taken to the floor and items are put on selves to be later scanned and put on pallets to be shipped out to customers. It is a very fast paced job."
good,"They do try there to make it fun, however if you do not like doing the exact same thing for 10+ hours straight, do NOT pick or work in packing. Literally the longest days of my life. It's just not for me."
good,The company is great! The only issue with me is I came from a office environment of 15 plus years so I am not use to standing 10 hours a day! It is grueling and unbearable for me. Not something to take lightly if you have never worked in a warehouse before.
good,It's was an okay work place whilst it lasted I'm just looking to find a better place of work where I enjoy the job and it will be permanent and I can progress with the job
good,"Le management chez Amazon est très dynamique et innovant, s'inspirant du management américain. Les managers sont disponibles, agréables et répondent à nos besoins, nos questions le plus efficacement possible. "
good,It was an alright experience they make you work all day with little to no breaks they don’t actually care about the employees and I can say this from experience.
good,"The job at Amazon was very enjoyable. The benefits were great. The only issues were lack of personal time and the shifts that were available."
good,"It was okay"
good,Spatna prace to neni ale prechazim na vedlejsi halu s jinymi smenami ktere mi nevyhovuji
good,"It was okay , if you wanted anything extra done you literally had to do it yourself. They train you on the basics and then let you go to venture out for yourself."
good,"You work and sleep and eat, and repeat everyday sometimes 6 days a week.  You will not have a life. You get paid great, but you will be too tired to spend it.  They care more for customers than the employees, they make you feel worthless due to them being too competitive.  But people might like that."
good,i really dont have any thing to say bad about the place it was a place to lose weight  lol it was a fast paced place must wear good shoes and have plenty of pain meds
good,"Working at amazon is really great. Its not the same everyday and you always have something new to learn. You always meet new people. Amazon is a very competitive place and it drives you to always do better. Management at amazon is really great, they have good people and responsible managers. The culture is like they say ""Work Hard And Make History"". The most enjoyable part of the job is that there is no hard parts to it. Everything seems like basics. Also that you get to share time with coworkers."
good,"Very fast paced workplace with a lot of different departments to work in. Great employees and surrounding energies. Almost like a big family."
good,Amazon is a good company. I make $14 an hour for 12 hours. I left because of my physical and health issues that don't fit me to work there. It's the stressful job!
good,this company offers excellent benefits but when you get hurt they dont believe you and they take forever to et you get the help you need from a doctor
good,"it all depends on what you do there, some people get lucky, some people get stuck doing the hardest job in the whole warehouse. What helps our day go by faster is requesting to take on different assignments, but we don't get the luxury to chose what else..."
good,I only been there for a month.  It's a lot of walking and carrying heavy boxes. But it's not that bad of work. If you like working with boxes and walking this is the place for you.
good,Ongoing Issues that should be fixed right away. management have no control over employees no matter how hard they work. Most times the harder you work is just oh thank you and others skate by and get the same recognition. I'm a hard worker and not just a get by or barely make a UPH/Goal/Rate (person) or whatever the case may be in a workplace !!
good,"The benefits that Amazon offers is wonderful. I have worked for other places that don't have as good to offer as Amazon does. The money is good, depending on your cost of living of course, but definitely competitive! "
good,"Along with pack rates, I served as Ambassador (trainer), process guide restocking and cleaning. Assist management in locating and shipping critical timed orders."
good,"Great company and benefits, but the hours are too long.  My shift was 4 days a week, 10-hour days.  4 days a weeks, 10-hour days was too much and they often made you work 1 hour overtime, so it was 11-hour days!!!!"
good,"The job consisted mostly of walking around the warehouse and picking products. Problem is it was 12 hours of walking almost 20 miles a day. Also the workplace environment is that of a graveyard, everyone is practically dead and you don't get to talk to coworkers because you are separated. It just drags on, but you do get excellent benefits like full health, dental, and vision and unbeatable wages."
good,"Very dysfunctional  company, not organize. Do not tell employees, everything that is available to them. Management  not up to pur on what is going on in the rest of the warehouse."
good,"great place to work for, you can come in and leave whenever using your paid time off or unpaid time.the only downfall is the long hours and the extreme heat in the building."
good,4 days a week 10 hrs is a easy schedule the only time you have a hard time at work is durning peak season. but its a fun job plus you can headphones which a lot of warehouse don't let you
good,"They did their best to make things fun and interesting but the job simply wasn't fun or interesting. Plus I had 10 weeks straight of mandatory overtime with no end in sight, It was exhausting me."
good,well organized and you can meet new people. everyone works together management talks to you with respect and will help if need it. I would say the hardest part of the Job is working 10 hours a day. but you do have 3 days off. you truly have to be physically fit to do this job.
good,"The compensation is ok but not that great but it's a good job specially for young beginners and student's who need that extra days off for school.  Full health benefits for a small amount to pay, a lot of Paid time off any time you want to schedule it, Paid Vacation and Unpaid time off unless you used all up then you'll be subject for warning or termination. You will learn a lot of things but will also throw you very where once you learn it, A lot of young managers some are good but some are bad also only care is about the rate or their own achievement. But your co-workers are the most important part, a lot of helpful and friendly people who will become your friend. Physically fit is required a long hours of standing and heavy lifting, and more long hours and a lot of overtime during peak season."
good,"One of the best jobs I've ever had . "
good,"Bonne ambiance aux travail, très souriant pas beaucoup de pause mais cela suffit"
good,"Nelituji práce v Amazonu,určitě je to bohatá zkušenost do života,byla jiná než na jakou jsem byla zvyklá,ale není to práce na dlouho.Je to tam hodně hektické a hlavně velký nápor na nohy.Dělala jsem ji ráda a myslím,že i dobře.Bohužel poslední měsíce se to tam dost změnilo,řekla bych že k horšímu a to byl jeden z důvodů proč to nezkusit jinde.Nikdy jsem si nemohla stěžovat na kolegy nebo mé nadřízené.Nejtěžší části práce jsou ty kde je to přetížené pro ženy a přesto s tím musí manipulovat.Myslím,že z mého pohledu je tam dost věcí co je potřeba změnit."
good,"A typical day would be clocking in, going to stand up to see how much we have and check to see where you are assigned. Pick off, spiltter, sort slide, inbound and scanning. We get trucks in from amazon facilities and unload those  trucks and put them onto pallets and send them off to FedX or somewhere else."
good,It is a Fast pace work place. Great place to work BUT no room for growth. Management is hard to work with. The hardest part of the job is no support from the management.
good,I have be work there for 8 month and I enjoy it  and nice people all different their cultures and respect  and I'm a company of Amazon  imwork in inbound and outbound also handler so I get laid off for my rate so  I guess that all I say
good,i don't know what to say the job was hard and i quit after 2 months  if you really need the money then apply other then that it was kinda boring and night shifts made you not have time.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Gore but the stated culture was not practiced. Everyone kept telling ""That's just in the Fabrics division."" When I employed the culture I was reprimanded."
good,"The paid and hours is stable. It is very easily job but hard part is have keep rate score to 100 percent every week. It is large place, You will have walk a lot maybe up to 12 miles a day for 10 hours a day."
good,"working at Amazon was a fun place to working  especially  peak season i enjoy working at amazon the workers were friendly manager treat you with respect, the HR team help you with whatever it is"
good,"So currently we had a high turnover rate and then I get an email stating that they want to extend my seasonal position for additional months. I do not think it is worth it to drugged through the mud with their customers only to see that they want to keep you in the position you are in. The pay is higher than other work from home companies but in my opinion, I'd rather go back to my other job making more money."
good,"hard job with little pay..."
good,Working at amazon opens a lot of doors. The managers and other associates make it a fun place. The shift and given job can impact your personal experience.
good,"Amazon is a very fun place to work!"
good,A typical work day is making sure you put any and all software on the kindle so it can be prepared to be shipped off. I learned a lot of data entry requirements at this job. My co-worker are great we all work together as a team. The hardest part of the job is we have to meet a quota and keep our hours up so we're not down and have a good productive day.
good,"Amazon is great if you like fast paced workplaces, and lots of different cultures. You can advance very quickly depending on your work ethics. Great benefits good pay."
good,"pick item scan, make box, seal with invoice and item in, send down line and start again"
good,"every day was the same, started with small meeting with managers and them everyone go to them jobs."
good,Would like advancement with the Company. Enjoy the Job itself on a daily basis. They Acknowledge their Employees when they are doing a Job well done. Not enough Vacation hours given.
good,"I had a pretty good time while i worked there. I was laid off because of my rates, it was ridiculous, it was my first job so i got some experience now :D"
good,"I worked for Amazon.com for almost 5 yrs. I worked in many different capacities from cycle count to problem solve both inbound, outbound and receive. It was a fast paced job, sometimes stressful but rewarding at other times. Benefits were great, the ability to see how one of the major online retailer worked was a bonus."
good,The job is fun but it is hard work. It is not a job where you can come in and think that you will relax. The benefits and opportunity for advancement is great though.
good,Shipping packing ordering. working on the computer to make sure that the inventory and product was countable.Working on trucks to get the orders out. Make sure labels on packages for shipment. Make sure that's quality of the product it's not damaged in any way before shipping.
good,"Very well team oriented. Great for students still in school   .     Its very fast place . People are generally very helpful.                         "
good,"Am a strong person who is determined to help people for the sack of God."
good,"Lot of people  believe amazon is hard and that they treat  people like slaves. Well let me tell you that is honestly a big lie . If you like to work and like to be active amazon its the place to do it "
good,fast pace environment once accustom to the duties it is manageable. it is a job that requires exertion of energy so its best to stay hydrated. productivity is a must
good,"A typical day at work is very fast paced, all hand on. You're always moving because at the end of your shift the packages must be sorted in order for the next shift to complete their job. They give overtime almost everyday."
good,"Overall it was something new which made it  great experience, but I wish they looked more into the people they hired because it made my experience okay."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the people I worked with at Amazon but that body aching work was too much. They expect you to stand for 10 hours to work and your not allowed to sit anywhere in the building unless you're in a breakroom, bathroom, or operating a machine that requires you to sit. HR's not even allowed to sit. Overall, the work is easy and can be fun if you decide to challenge yourself. Everyone checks on you throughout the shift to make sure you're mentally and physically ok."
good,"I have learned fork lifting,picking,packing,stowing,counting,drive pit machine. The management team is reliable every Friday at start up we have fun events"
good,Management where understanding and friendly and the pay is great for the job but only if you can literally stand walking for 8 hours. Personally I couldn't keep up with the job criteria plus constant crouching in a knee breaker.
good,"I've learned how to input customers orders in the right location by using a handheld scanner"
good,"Amazon encourages their associates to work hard while living well and staying fit. In this fast pace atmosphere an associate will be pushed to the limit. In essence, if an individual is well rested and keeps themselves hydrated any task is possible within the fulfillment center at Amazon. While working for Amazon I was able to adapt to the diverse culture which allowed me to learn a great deal about diversity and consumer demands. This fast pace environment keeps you on your toes. The most difficult part of my experience was the 12 hour overnight shift. Amazon is a great employer who takes care of their associates. Such as benefits and compensation. I would recommend Amazon to anyone."
good,It’s messy but keep to yourself and worry about your check lol that’s all I did it’s fast paced and I got to do a little of everything so I enjoyed it I am going back to amazon
good,"Working at an Amazon fulfillment warehouse  can be a challenge. It definitely takes a toll on your body, however Amazon provides a good amount of paid time off and also unpaid so you can take a break from work when you feel too tired or for whatever reasons . The staff is very respectful and it is a friendly place."
good,staff was good to work with we all got a long. i enjoyed training people from all different parts off the world. hardest part of the job was around Christmas time got very busy
good,"It was a great experience working at a large capacity supply chain like amazon, the people and the managers we’re awesome and I would like to return as a manager someday."
good,"It was a good experience working for this company. Engaging with knowledgeable managers and a clean, safe place to work for employees. Very Flexible schedules and managers willing to help."
good,"Amazon is a fast pace working environment. They stress safety. Training was not that great. But, work isn't that hard. Managers are willing to work with you. They just care that the work gets done so the packages can go out. As long as you're doing your job you are good to go. Can increase back problems."
good,"If you already have back  and or knee problems beware, this is a physical job.  Try to work smalls, semi-induct, or pulling smalls and scanning them  in with a scan gun."
good,You are just another number in the system it is up to up to stick out. It’s difficult being at the bottom but if you stay dedicated and give it your best it is worth it
good,It is a good place to work unfortunately the pay is not enough for myself. They do offer career advancement but there are alot of employees so it takes some tine.
good,"been employed here for almost three years. it has its ups and downs but its OK. the benefits are fantastic and looking forward to my second set of stocks. it has its advantages and disadvantages, but what job don't."
good,"Amazon was competitive because theirs many of Amazons out there trying to get there numbers and shipment to the highest percent, and the benefit for the employees were good if you were to get the job done. What I didn't like the most is when I asked to get taught how to do something different then stowe I was never trained over and that was aggravating because I wanted to learn more in the warehouse then just one or two jobs."
good,"CVG 2, 10 hours a day, doing basic warehouse work, evaluating the condition of customer returns and determining whether or not they can be resold at a discounted price, brand-new sellable, or liquidated and sent back to the vendor. I learned the upstream portion of the shipment process when the returns first arrive in the building to the steps they must take to get to the trucks for transit to a different location. Long hours, a lot of standing in one place can be stressful at times. The hardest part was the heavy lifting I experienced there along with the heat during the summer. Most enjoyable part was the amazing associates I had the pleasure to meet and work with."
good,Crazy place to work at. You must be ready for everything they throw at you. You will be exhausted until about the third or 4th week. The pay is good but try not to get injured or it'll be a tough struggle to get back to work. The people and most of the managers are friendly and want to see you succeed.
good,good mangers and hr team. the hardest part is learning the rates. Everyone is good to work with. I have learned you have to move at a fast pace. You have to work mandatory over time. You also have to work on some holidays. They have good health insurance policies.
good,Good place to work at ...great benefits and hours is FANTASTIC.Everyone makes you feel comfortable and team work is always GREAT.only thing you do get tired on your feet if you havent had a job like this before
good,Wake up clock in at 7:30am . Co uple stretches before starting work.Nice helpful workers to lead us to the right path on doing right .
good,I got caught ina wreck and i didnt have time to cover it. And they me to leave on good terms i pointed out. Up until i was aaked to leave i had been with amazon for 8 months i really like the job more there is more possibilities out there
good,"My skills like time-management, prioritization of tasks, expressing clearly and fluently, handling pressure situations, having an attitude of never giving up, etc., have gotten brushed up with the work experience. "
good,"Loved, loved loved my job at Amazon and was more than thrilled to go in. However the men working there are all a bunch of horndogs without a clue. They dont mind to do as they please and grope you at any given point. Management never done a thing to help. Other than the pig like men, its extremely enjoyable, fast paced and a very friendly/diverse environment. Plus SO many benefits and great time off plan!"
good,"It was a pleasure to be associated with amazon, while working for Testing projects, loved every bit of it .Best wishes eveyone"
good,Its a good place to wk for but you really have to watch your points hr will do you over real quick I went to work this morning as I try to go through the turn stales my badge wouldn't work it had said that I was terminated they give you 6 PTS I only had 5 well needless to say I had clocked in from lunch early and that had given me a .5 pt it's ridicules needless to say
good,"its a great workplace, great management, only worry is job security into the future"
good,"Long hours, fast paced. All about numbers. (that.s just my opinion). Supervisors were very kind and will work with you set aside training for speed and accuracy."
good,"Amazon prime is good place to work out if you just want extra money in your pocket, they have great benefits, work around your school schedule, and good hours"
good,Overall Amazon is a Customer Service Centric Company. Not only do they focus on external customers they also focus on internal customers. They are set to develop associates.
good,Hardest part of the job is standing and hard not to say anything to anyone because they have such nasty attitudes only cause they get paid more and feel like they can do and say whatever
good,I definitely liked the hours I worked and the staff was very helpful and resourceful in their positions. The only draw back was the number of employees...at times you felt like you were loss in the shuffle.
good,It's a hit or miss. Everyone has there own opinion of the place & job. It can be very stressful at times & they push you to make your numbers. I enjoyed my time there bu they can be very grimy at times.
good,"It can be tiring as you are working long hours, but is worth the money. You Can get easily bored while working as you are constantly doing the same thing."
good,It was a great experience learning in a productive atmosphere. I was reliable and quick learner.i love working with purple and making them smile by my accurate work
good,If you don't want no social life and make  good money it might be the right place for you as the shift the warehouse the shift are pretty much from 6am till 6 pm or 7pm till 5:30 am. There is literally no time to do anything before or after work as the shift are really draining
good,"I worked there for medical ins when my husband was laid off. It was definitely a different experience for me, however it was interesting to see how it all works, everything involved and meeting and getting to know the people that make it all happen."
good,you’ll have a lot of friends & you’ll have fun or maybe not this is only my experience and also my supervisor is really nice and understanding the only problem is they dont raise the minimum wage it is still 13$ where i work and i have to work 10 hours a day
good,"Fast paced, collaborative workplace. Good benefits, fair discounts. Lacks many hours as Prime Now Associates but the salary makes up for a decent amount of the scarcity. Team members and management have positive attitudes, good humor, and are always willing to help another."
good,"Amazon really is an excellent company to work for, but sometimes I do think that they are not fair when it comes to converting seasonal employees to blue badges."
good,Amazon is a fast paced environment. Its very competitive and you can always work hard to build your position in this company. The pay is amazing and the people there are great to work with and listen to your needs.
good,"I am friendly and helpful information about job and happy every time to work so I recognize work goods and keep safety job and experience more jobs."
good,The hardest part of the job is going in the box and finding the items when you are a picker. The good thing about it is you have to be productive.
good,"Typical day at work included scanning products."
good,Great experience. Learned alot from amazon. Love to work again over there. Dedicated person willing to work  and provide my commitment
good,I have worked in almost every department at this company and it is a good job with good benefits. It is fast-paced and hard work. The shifts are 10 hours which is a little long but you have 3 days a week off except during very busy times when you can expect to work 50-60 hours a week. This company does lack in organization and changes the rules frequently and managers rotate in and out before you get to know them. I would recommend it if you want something for 5 years or less but not a career unless you are one of the lucky few that move into management roles.
good,I worked at the number 5 facility in the net work. I enjoyed the day to day task as well as learning new things . I advanced to a tier 3 working a year and received a transfer to a new facility just opening up. I am trained as in my resume for several different positions.
good,Fast-paced working job long hours  I want to see what you saw and work was fine it was very competitive  they have large lunch in the break room I have a variety of snacks  I am games to play
good,"They have very big day targets, that some people can not reach them without runing, that's not health and safety, because I think that job speed and targets supposed to be available to everyone and not everybody can be so speede as some of them."
good,you had to lift a lot of heavy books in boxes and walk a lot with a cat but it was good everyone had team work everyone was helpful the hardest thing was lifting
good,"I particularly enjoyed dealing with new customer each day. Also, helping customers gave me so much peace of mind. Furthermore, it was in my local vicinity so commute was easy."
good,Working there was very hard you were on your feet for 12 hours straight. Besides that the pay and benefits were great. The co -workers were great to work with. The management were ok there were not understanding if you had problems.
good,"I would  start my shift at 7pm, clock in and attend into a briefing including my co workers and company managers. "
good,loved my job hate that i had to quit. if it wasn't for my pregnancy and becoming a mother i would still be there. coworkers are great and very nice. hardest part of the job was rushing and pushing the heavy carts. other than that i enjoyed my job and recommend it to anyone.
good,I worked in the part -time building. I wish they had an option for full time in MKE5 because I truly enjoyed the work. I didn't like only 4 hour shifts.
good,"Very good job and interesting to work there highly recommended , I done night shift and I loved it because I didn’t waste any of my day it was just all at night"
good,i worked in this place for a couple of months but the location was a bit to far for me
good,"I enjoy working for amazon. it is very fast paced especially since I went to shift AD01, always on the move."
good,"Ti usano solamente per i loro piani aziendali,siamo solo un  numero a loro conta la produzione"
good,I really wanted to keep that job but I ended up moving  it was really fun tho learning new things always on my feet it was a work out as well I wish I could do it all again
good,"it was a trash place to work, the management held grudges and though they could talk to anybody how they please. They definitely was not about helping."
good,You are breaking your back to deliver packages they say you have 10 hour days let's say 6 hour days they start late and end you early and press the issue if your not moving fast enough but if you have 5 boxes going to the 4th or 5th floor with no cart it hurts your knees your back and you can't stop because you gotta be finished at 6:30 but you start at 12:30 with 175 packages and a 125 stops
good,The job was very fast paced. There was lot of standing and walking for 7 to 7 1/2 hours. You were required to lift product up to 75lbs. Management didn't have a problem helping co-workers problem solve.
good,"was good pay but you get the same amount every weeks unless you wanna do overtime on your days off, you always ""flex up"" and you only get one break even if you work 6 hours"
good,"My typical day consisted primarily of packaging up customers' online purchases in order to get them ready for shipping, as well as various other tasks. Refilling boxes to work stations, etc."
good,"It pays well, but is very demanding on the body and mind. Also it doesn’t leave much time for family when it’s mandatory Overtime during peak seasons."
good,I like working at Amazon but I don't like how they conduct their business with how you have to talk with HR and if you had an emergency there is no call back number to talk to someone to let them know if there is an emergency or how they do everything by email and not on hand it's kind of a problem for a lot of people there at the company they need to find better ways of communication at their facilities because all the communication is through texting email
good,I would work for some hours or show up for work but wouldn’t be able to work after showing up for work & not get paid for all hours that I was there for.
good,"they make sure you are exhausted at the end of the day, with zero energy left..to have a life. I compare Amazon to a battery you come in charged up by the end of the day your at zero charge..you have no energy to do anything else if you work for  them, other companies want you to be able to do other things and drive good vehicles.."
good,it was good pay but very stressful and they always pick their favorites this is not a place of employment with anyone who wants to spend time with family or children
good,"This company is very fast paced. They tell you they are concerned about you, but really its all about the rate, or the production number. the turnover rate is very high."
good,"No time for life and definetly don't feel as if you will move up in the company, very repetitive on a daily basis and no chance to do anything different in the warehouse. defintly not meant for people who have dreams and goals in life"
good,"They need to have high expectations that is true but not at the risk of a associate failing the first or second week, maybe they should see if they would be more successful for the company and themselves to be put in a department that is best for both parties if no spot is available then what's their 2nd strong point and so on ."
good,"got you in great shape good place to work"
good,"The staff come in and stretch before we start working, look on the board and see where you will be working. I have learned their system and how they ship their packages out."
good,one thing i give amazon is you can work there for a year and they will pay 95% of tuition in any field or school your going to. Also they wont force you to go home if there is no work so your always  get 40hr a week
good,"Picking and packing "
good,The money isn’t bad But the treatment is unfair managers show favoritism with routing not good with training and not good with communicating If you’re good friends with management you’ll make out just fine your routes will be easy and you will get the good vehicle to drive
good,"TOM transportation team manager is clueless about this department. Advancement is based on favoritism and who kisses MGMT behinds."
good,"I worked in customer returns. It was horrible. I was written up for my rate the first five weeks I was there to  a final write-up. I had to make an appeal and 2 write-ups were removed. So many foreigners that I didn't even feel like I was in my own country. They would steal our totes full of packages and send them on the lower conveyor belts to their friends so thay they could make their rates while we had none. The rate was 270 a night. People could not look at quality of item to get their rate. I saw items not just being passed through so they could get their numbers. Clothes that were soiled with human waste and body fluids. Bathing suits that were worn by someone else being passed on as new. Amazon sold them as new. Most clothes were sprayed with febreze by customer. Shoes were worn many times and sold as new. I saw a housecoat in which I thought was a design but it was full of lent and torn and hygiene issues. Customer got it and freaked out. Smelly worn out clothes and shoes I wouldn't pay 5 cents for at a yard sale. All bagged and sold as new. We were expected to be at 100% rate or above every night and pushed to get 105%, 110%, nothing was enough. If we were 98% we had first write up that lasted 30 days. If you got a second write up for rate it lasted 60 days even if your first write up was about to roll off. A third write up was for 90 days and  then you were fired. If you came in to work overtime and someone stuck you at a lower station you were written for that week's rate. The job was grueling. Going to the bathroom would set you back. You were pushed so hard that"
good,it was a good place to work just a very competitive place to work. the manager didn't talk to me when there was a problem. just got written up without letting me know that there was something wrong
good,"A usual workday at Amazon consisted of 10+ hours of physical labor. There is a lot of favoritism so depending on who you're working under, the work days would vary. The breaks were short and started once you left your work area."
good,"The first week of working in Amazon, I have learned a lot especially time management, speed, accuracy, and multitasking between other stations. The hardest part of the job is not being able to get overtime. I would highly recommend amazon to anyone willing to work in an environment with speed and efficiency."
good,Management did not portray management skills and it seemed very organized with training and responding. Training didnt last long and was only videos with not much practice
good,Too many managers NOT aligned with the mission statement that get in each others way.  Getting feedback takes upwards of weeks.  Management turnover is standard.
good,Great Place to work just no full time positions.I would had liked to become an employee there if they had full time job.Personal in the facility were every friendly and respectful.I feel that the Temp Agency don't give you enough time or months of employement..
good,"typical day: come in set up your station, which was typically set up for you by the shift before you come in, that was a requirement, sign in on your computer and begin working."
good,Typical day is arriving at work is sorting packages or either running the line to  put packages at a current location to get it set for delivery. The hardest part of the job being nourished enough because you walk everywhere and the most enjoyable part of the job is you are on your own manager. The schedule is very reasonable and flexiable.
good,Nice working environment. Only one problem is there is some kind of persons dont allow to learn & grow anything. If you are more than qualified them they will corner you coz they have a fear that we cross them. They don't allow to growup. Otherwise its a best opportunity.
good,I enjoyed working with Amazon but the experience greatly depends on the warehouse in which you are employed. I found the position perfect for me and built my workship with those that are hardworking/ positive people. The key to happiness and productivity at Amazon is focus on task.
good,"And everyone is not for Amazon. "
good,Good opportunity to learn a skill and move on. At amazon a fair start is essential for your career success. The leadership principles guide the employee`s live stile.
good,"Lots of backstabbing people in the management. Lots of people doing random stuff during the shifts. Awkward working hours, 7:30-11:30, management  has issues with communication"
good,It was ok for the seasonal position I was hired for. I'm not sure many people could handle it full time. I liked the fast paced and working alone.  I would work there again
good,"Was fired over an issue with time off, HR refused to help me with said issue yet helped another person with the same problem resulting in me being laid off. Company is great, definitely not for anyone but worth it."
good,"load trucks and vans, unload trucks and vans, pick orders from asimbly line, scan products, deliver products to customers, communicate with dispatch and customers"
good,"emlpoi precaire,management a mourir "
good,"I was a part-time evening employee. I would clock in by 9:00 pm; usually, we did not know what time we would be leaving.  It depended on the work load that day.  However, most evenings we would leave between 11:30 pm and 12:15 am. I learned quickly that there were little opportunities for job advancement.  "
good,Good work space... Great hours to work. Clean safe environment. Commutation with staffing companies needs to improve. Love amazon pace over all.. Higher pay will help
good,"It’s not a realistic job for people who have families. The hours are extremely long. Also when you hit your max pay rate, your stuck at a stand still in your life. They also don’t pay for options for school that most people will want to do."
good,Fast Pace environment. Repetitive task. Not easy to make advancements inside company. Good Benefits and time paid off. Learned to work in fast pace environment and produce numbers.
good,Currently working for Amazon. Pay does not compensate with the work that is required. Management staff not trained well enough to perform required task. 10 hour shifts are hard because of the task that have to be done.
good,beaucoup de travail demandé mais cadence qui me convenait ayant un grand besoin de bouger et être occupée
good,"Good for temporary job. Very unorganized. Very fasted paced. Very stressful. They did however , give you the opportunity to work as many hours as you could but did it in such a way that you could not collect overtime."
good,"numbers, numbers, numbers...if you are not hitting them the company will make you pay. You are expected to be working 100% of the day, with minimal breaks. All time off task is watched like a hawk."
good,Don't say noting at all. is what I've been taught. Blah Blah Blah. Long hours pay was good. Management that's a whole different issues.Even if you are.
good,promotions and advancement are based on friendships not how well you do your job. management does not listen or care. as a results employees do not care and do poor work.
good,The only way to make it thru Amazon is stick to yourself. Working for 10 hours straight can take something to get use to. Strike rules and a lack of communication skills throughout the company.
good,"Amazon / Integrity staffing solutions are very critical to the employees, always negative feedbacks,"
good,if you like meeting new interesting people then this might be the place  for you im litterally only typing more because the box says i need to fill up 150 characters. and done !
good,Wouldn’t take the chance of making a career out of working warehouse in this company. Advancement was slow and it’s taxing on the body. Was thought to manage at the time also being a full time student
good,"In my experience on the FC and FC support (IT) sides there is much left wanting but also much left sated. The ethos is ""Boxes out the door"" which is understandable but can sometimes eclipse associate health. IT side is a bit pretentious but if you have the knack for it and can ""play politics"" (with a bit of understanding that some things roll down hill NOT up) you can have a chance at it. Be prepared to lose some home time though. During my time there pay was sub par, but that could have changed by now."
good,"They put customer first, without caring for employees as humans. The meetings they hold semi annually is not enough effort. They need clean water, realistic schedules and better air quality in the warehouse."
good,"If you are lazy or complain alot, please do not apply here. Speed and accuracy are important. Favoritism does exist and there are alot of bad attitudes there."
good,"Its an ok place to work but, needs to work on the management of its driver associate program. The pay needs to be a little higher based off of the amount of labor required to properly do the job. For example: A delivery driver should get paid no less than $20.00 per hr. considering the amount of work he is given. It can be overwhelming."
good,La carga de trabajo es mínima a comparación de otros cedis/almacenes.
good,It was chill at times working here but management sucked. You had to kiss axx in order for them to like you and for you to get away with certain things.
good,"I worked as a driver for Amazon for a little bit but I was always a driver who delivered on time. "
good,Amazon is a good place to work at i enjoyed it it was my first delivery job. The only thing i didn't like was that fact that it didn't have no benifits. The managers was pretty cool and the co works was pretty cool
good,"worked here for 5 years, the managers treat you like garbage and they get away with it because HR is corrupt. they LOA is a joke, they approve you then ""auto deny"" it after you took the time off so you'll get fired"
good,Working in amazon was fun and exciting. I used to get a chance to learn something new every day and it was only 4 days of work. managers and other associates were so nice.
good,"I'm sure the company isn't too bad but just be careful when you see some shady stuff going on, but apparently don't ask questions. Because that's exactly how I got fired"
good,scanned and loaded packages to pallet for transporting. would recommend.hardest part was unexpected overtime. meeting new people was a plus.worked well with others
good,Parfait pour les self made-mans et tout ceux et celles qui aiment se débrouiller seuls.
good,"A fast-growing organization that requires an ""All In"" mentality.  You are able to learn a lot about the digital media industry and work with many different brands to help them grow their footprint on the Amazon.com ecosystem."
good,"Data Center Management is constrained. When I was on-boarded, the management team knew I was coming, yet had not completed necessary on-boarding preparation. Even my credentials where not ready when I arrived. I was required to wait 4 hours for my credentials, after I was supplied with a handbook that I was tested for after reviewing the Policy onsite. I Passed the review. And eventually was given my necessary credentials. Then my training session was supposed to being. There were no instructions to follow that were up to date and accurate. It was as if this function of the on-boarding process was being used to VET people with the skills to discover and learn on their own, which I did successfully. Yet it was frustrating, because my expectation of Amazon was that of excellence and organization. My experience was exactly the opposite. It was as if i was being paid to save face for a job that only a few people wanted anyone to have access to. It was very cultist. Beyond the Initial training period which I eventually succeeded. I felt like the on-boarding process needed a dedicated person to keep it up. I was willing to fill this role, but it was not part of my responsibilities. When I offered my manager the willingness on my part to do so, it was shrugged off as inconsequential. "
good,"Amazon gets a bad name in terms of employee relationship, but that is often based on accounts from team members in the distribution centers.  Amazon in Seattle is fun, fast-paced, office environments, which often contain cube farms and a sea of ""door desks"".  The CEO is innovative and speaks real language answering candid questions regularly and inviting employee feedback.  He truly is a very bright mind.  While he is business savvy, he focuses on managing people to innovate on the behalf of their customers.  What would the customer want?  The HR policies are not family friendly, and stack ranking at the company results in an average employee lifespan of 3-5 years, with over half of the employees moving elsewhere in the first 2 years.  Amazon, Microsoft, Google and other technical teams in Seattle often cycle through each other's employees, with it being common for an employee to go to one for a year or two, move to a competitor, and then return as a process for career and pay advancement.  As long as you go into it eyes open, the ideals of the company and its founder  are world class.  Execution at the entry level and first year management is what you would expect with employee churn where it is.  If Amazon could do a better job at getting their first year managers the people skills needed to coach employees to success, they would be an organization people would not want to springboard from or to."
good,My experience wasnt completely terrible. I made decent money it was nice working 4 on and 3 off. The enviroment though gives off waves of immaturity. No one will bother you I just did my work and went home. The healthcare is very questionable I'm stuck with an 1800 hospital bill because of a pinched nerve in my back that ended up getting me laid off because it could never fully heal with that kind of physical demand. The event happend while I was converting from temp to full time Amazon employee so my insurance was in limbo. Neither plan covered my bill because they said I never sign off on some paperwork. I was never given paperwork to sign off of.
good,"I get to work but the support system is so poor No real help whatsoever they don’t consider or look into your case "
good,"Overall a good company to work for with great benefits, but moving up or even transferring departments is difficult to do with the amount of favoritism in place."
good,just training and some calls to see the web site etc       training about the web site about the nr articules and specification of the product factory made
good,"I learned new tasks and skills. "
good,"Wasn't the right job for me at the time, was my first job after an accident, breaks were short and I worked third shift, paid great, wasn't a good fit"
good,"Amazon pays higher rates in the industry but one has to work under straining conditions and long hours especially during the peak seasons. There are few short breaks."
good,"love the energy, love the agility, and the creativity.  Company does not want to grow up. Immature management methods, and an over emphasis on data at the expense of all other things.  Frugality is misinterpreted to mean ""don't spend money"" but incredible internal inefficiencies  cost much more"
good,"The work is boring and brainless. You are paid to do, not to think. As long as you accept that, do your hours, at the end of the day you get a good paycheck."
good,"The job's not too bad, but if it's through an agency like at Basildon You'll be overworked during busy periods, and have your shifts cancelled at will, sometimes with only ten minutes notice during quiet spells. In really quiet spells be prepared to work less 20 hours a week."
good,"Despite my 'title' as integrity 'coach', I was another run of the mill expendable asset, able to be fired on a whim, because I wasn't needed. I was brought in at 2 PM on a day my shift started at 6 PM, and ran until 4 AM, for 'orientation' for being a coach, after I had been one for over two months. Half way through my 14 hour shift, I was told I wasn't a coach anymore, and left."
good,"it was fun. I wouldn't mind going back. many different people, its fun but can be tiring at the end of the day, or middle. I loved my manager, she was the best ive ever had!"
good,"Not enough hours but i love the work place it's  fast paced, fun environment,  and u learn new things every day. I would stay here if i could get more hours it's kinda hard only working part time and I'm a mother of 3 with bills but overall great place."
good,long hours standing in 1 place 30min lunch break takes to long to get from warehouse to locker to canteen leaves about 10mins to eat your lunch even less time if you smoke and have to go outside
good,"Productive fast pace work environment ,long days, lots of overtime ,great checks, clean environment, friendly coworker's"
good,You will not find a better compensation package in the area.  Fast paced.  The atmosphere is constantly changing.  Advancement is difficult to achieve.
good,"This is a big company, but depending where you work, or your job title, thing could be different. I love the flexibility in scheduling. I get to set my own schedule. This is a physical work, regardless of your gender. Lots of lifting"
good,"Amazon is an okay place to work if youve never had a ""real"" job before. Just make sure you go in as an Amazon employee and not intergrity. Amazon has great benefits and even offers to pay your tuition for school."
good,Very fast paced work. constantly on your toes travelling around the county delivering multi drop parcels to resident and commercial addresses.
good,"If you want to change anything in the company, you can voice your idea and they can make the change. If you do not show off, ideas can be easily be used by someone else to take the credit for their own advancement. Building a great team can be easily be brought down by the wrong manager for not knowing what they are getting themselves into. Military background discriminated against what they have done in the past instead of showing pride and help for fellow veterans."
good,"a typical day at work is everyday thing.learned how to multitask more work in face paced environment.,manage to stay on my feet. coworkers was okay to work with. picking items fast."
good,its ok not the best place to work high targets for demand within a learning curve of 4 weeks difficult to maintain a steady balance of work and social life
good,"A typical day at amazon was first stretching to ensure all your muscles are stretched so you don't get injured, then you went to your work station, where you performed your task you were assigned. Working with amazon i have met alot of great people, it was very friendly, everyone made sure you were safe and no one got hurt. Amazon made sure you didn't lift any thing heavy, you always had someone around to help you. management helped you when you had an issue, they always came around and if they didn't know an answer they made sure you knew the answer before the end of shift.  The hardest part of the job was standing on your feet all day, walking a lot of miles per day, and lifting constantly along with heavy lifting."
good,have nothing good to say about Amazon. Amazon is hard work for little pay.
good,FTEs at Amazon doesn't treat consultants well. They think that consulants are some sort of labor even though the pay would be higher than FTEs. The environment really sucks.
good,Working for amazon was fun and exciting cause everyday was something different.
good,"Good place to work, but some strict rules are hard to follow."
good,management is horrible they don't work around your school schedule hardest part of the job is being on your feet for 10 hours a day.
good,"Uma empresa agradável, onde eu apreendi muito, me dou muito bem com meus colegas de trabalho, sei trabalhar em equipe, trabalho com seriedade, a parte boa e trabalhar ajudando as pessoas, dando oportunidade de trabalho. Porem a empresa se limita e atender as necessidades dos funcionários com cursos ensinamentos, incentivos, esse é a parte difícil e se torna uma batalha, porque apesar de apresentarmos projetos, mesmo assim não temos muito sucesso."
good,Started out on order picker where i got items out of the racks to get ready for shipping.Did that everyday for about three and half months.Then got moved over to rr reach where i was pulling pallets off the racks.They called it team liftbecause i had a partner who help me pick up the heavy items.Toughest part was getting forks inside the pallets fast and safe getting the items downs with out anything falling off.This being challenging as it was i learned to use my partner eyes as well as mine to safely secure everything.Seeing my production rate higher than 100% 98.7percent of the time was nice.and management showed there appreciation by giving out rewards
good,They don't value hard worker's...Management sucks...No room for advancement... Politics and favoritism allday everyday...Poor Hr associates...Money good that's it...
good,"Amazon can provide great compensation but the work environment can be toxic and demanding. You must interview with and join the right team. If you find yourself on the wrong team, then move to a new one quickly. It is a big company and you need to find like minded people that share your passion; then it is a great place to be. Commit to four years and you'll come away well compensated but don't expect management to be good for your career unless you are the top performer on your team (and don't out perform the young, over their head, boss or you can expect to be fired)."
good,"It was a little boring when there were not any calls. The scheduling was great, made my own schedule. Did not have the interaction of co-workers, got a little lonely."
good,"Pros: great benefits "
good,not bad just need to be more organize and need better supervisors and directions to be given to employees. I enjoyed it but wish there were other job opportunities there.
good,Management wasn’t all bad but the good ones never stayed. Always felt that I could be let go at any minute. A typical day was usually busy. A lot of the patients I had came in for reason that nothing to do with medical issue but it was with their time. I felt like I had act like a hall monitor instead of an emt. I had a lot of support for HR which helped but a lot of my issue that I felt with was a hr problem not amcare.
good,"bonne ambiance, cadence soutenu, pour un premier emploi cela convient"
good,Good for quick employment. Won't advise anyone to stay at the location for long. If you are just looking for experience than it is a great place to start.
good,"As I arrived the first week, the Onboarding process which as supposed to be 3 months long, was shortened to 2 weeks only. Then the employees that were supposed to help me with Onboarding were too busy and also took vacations.  The job was setup for me to fail, however I was able to work through most of it.  Once all the procedures were identified and I started to document, the position was offered to a younger person and I trained that person to take over for lower pay."
good,I like to work in amazon Logistics becos its a challenging job as a warehouse operative to me but management is not good becos they dont know how to manage all warehouse operations properly.positive point is that all workers co operative to each other always over all its a good organization to work .
good,"Work well and don’t waist time and there is ever chance of permanent employment. However most people who start for amazon are seasonal, don’t take it for granted a more permanent role will be there after peak times. They hire and fire on mass."
good,The job was A great side job. The pay was great and the work was soothing. Nothing is wrong with the job it’s self it was just the supervisor. He was barely there and barely trained the incoming employees. Everything we had to learn ourselves because there was no direction.
good,"Amazon looks @  Total Compensation for Tier 3 positions & higher, Associates hired from the outside receive sign on bonuses, their base salary, Restricted Stock Units, 401k match; however the salaries are not usually comparable to other companies in the industry so once employees have satisfied the stay for their sign on bonus they either promote out or resign for a higher paying job at another company."
good,I worked at amazon 8 months and just like that i got fired for putting my hands on the bristles to obtain a item that fell.You put an andon and they dont come then you take matters into your own and this is what happens so not fair especially me being there 8 months and never really late or absent but its ok ...
good,"Worked for Amazon for 4 years there was always mandatory OT, we did shift bids but even then they were not very flexible and did not seem to care anyone had families outside of work."
good,"I have enjoyed. My job. The work place is different then most,you are to develop your own skills ,take charge of your learning , be wailing to learning"
good,"The job is everything you’ve heard, the decision is yours as to whether it is something you can do or not. "
good,"It's a great place to work. I love working a long side the whole foods workers and my co workers. They paint this perfect picture to work there, but what they don't tell you is that you wont get hours and you have to fight to get hours and days to work!"
good,I didnt work there long enough to really say too much. It was a lot of physical labor and working in the heat wearing all black pulling heavy carts. You just have to have the drive and some physical strength to work there. You need to learn the city blocks and it becomes easier. Its nice to work alone sometimes and you work at your own pace but you cant move to slow.
good,Experience could have been a lot better. Balancing school and work was very difficult and the Amazon A to Z made it even harder. I went on leave for school and when I came back it said I had been terminated.
good,Amazon was amazing for me and my work level.............
good,Great pay very lil room for advancement but will pay for school after one year of work pays not bad and over time is there if wanted  just  management and change of departments can be tricky
good,"Cant really complain for the money you recieve extremely disheartening with constant pay offs even for the hard workers"
good,"Work-life balance is a term commonly used to describe the balance that a working individual needs between time allocated for work and other aspects of life. Areas of life other than work–life can include, but it is not limited to personal interests, family and social or leisure activities."
good,The company's regulations and policies on penilizing associates who fall behind time through transportation issues like missing a bus or long distance walk is disadvantage to associates who dont own a vehicle or lives far awar from job location.
good,"A typical day at work fast paced and stressful with long hours."
good,"Amazon.com, Inc. is a very strenuous job. There are always opportunities to make lateral transfers if you are able to move locations or job functions, however, it is difficult to receive promotions. "
good,"The hours are long but, it's only 4-days/week. Job is relatively easy as long as you don't mind repetition, monotony, and some heavy lifting. There is a lot of opportunity for advancement, however, make sure you get it in writing."
good,"My work experience is supervision . I,m very smooth handling to man power and I know understand to work do employee . My stronger point to communicate overall satisfied to worker and then any work to do worker."
good,"Working at amazon is  fun however, its mostly for the younger crowd "
good,"it's a good job for energetic people and personality's who can be extremely physical and active and stand, move and lift for 12 hours a day 5 to 6 days a week."
good,"After a year with the company, I relocated for a new launch to Oklahoma City, up to this point would have encouraged anyone to work for Amazon.  but this new location has some definite management issues, that do not follow with the companies principles, and fall short of providing the necessary tools and training to do the job, you are expected to do.  And as I stated, a very different culture and structure than my previous two stations, which were above and beyond, when it came to the culture of what they state the business to be.  I am heartbroken over the whole situation, but for the sake of my belief of what the company lays down as it's operating principles, I am going to escalate the short comings at this location, in hopes of helping others to not experience the same disappointment I encountered."
good,"Schon nach kurzer Zeit kann man hier bis zu mehr als 2000 EUR Netto verdienen. Bei mir hat das etwas weniger als ein Jahr gedauert. "
good,Its not set up for success amazon could be much better. If your willing to sacrifice your outside life. And work like a robot this is the job for you. Side note great for a temporary job.
good,"It is a great place to work, if you like to stand on your feet all and day and prefer hands on jobs. Every quarter you automatically get 40 hours of PTO. You have a  different job everyday and  it does not get boring, great atmosphere"
good,"Working at amazon taught me how to manage all types of people in a fast past high production rate work area.  It is not a job for everyone because it requires serious physical labor and you must meet certain rates etc to maintain your job no excuses.  This was not a problem for me because I am used to working long hard hours and have the desire to always learn more and move up, but that is what amazon lacked for me.  I had reached my maximum pay for my position and could not get promoted without going back to school for a degree which was not possible with the hours I was required to work and the physical tole it took on me."
good,Most of the managers have no expiration on the phones so they are unable to help you. Sometimes it is very hard to help a customer with no further information.
good,As an Amazon shopper I received a lot of orders to process in a timely manner. The manager is very nice. There is no pressure working there. But the space allowed to the Prime Now Services is so small that makes the job very difficult. It's not easy to pickup shifts. They post a small amount of shifts twice a week and we employees are all complaining about that. Otherwise that would be a good place to work. Co-workers are friendly and everyone help each other.
good,"Warehouse associates are under paid at amazon fulfillment center, there is a lot of work so you don’t have to worry about work being slow. Management is ok depending on which department you are located in."
good,"The job is for someone looking to make supplemental income...to go to the movies or pay ""a"" bill."
good,"productive but some lack of communication from management to underlings"
good,"I enjoyed my time there. It was nice to wear whatever I wanted and they played music which was cool. It was laid back and chill most of the time. I worked overnights, which I loved because I'm a night owl. I had to leave because of babysitting issues."
good,"Buon lavoro, ambiente giovanile, sicuramente ci tornerei."
good,4 -10 hour shifts are nice and make it easy for a 4 day full time job and the opportunity for overtime was always there. However it was the most boring and mind numbing work i've ever done in my life.
good,"the workers were good fun to wokr with and really helped to get through the night. some nights work was too much to handle other nights it was a breeze."
good,"Average hours worked was only about 20 per week. Had the ability to gain more hours during holiday peaks. "
good,"Fast paced organization with good growth prospects, however HR systems are still not in place and the pace might be too breakneck for some ,and rewards too less"
good,"Starting pay is not bad at all. Managers are nice and compensating. However, most of the co-workers are a bit grumpy. Sometimes work is overwhelming but you get help as there are people there to help you out."
good,At amazon there were a lot of different jobs to do but if a job does not suit you well it is hard to switch to a different department and you are not able to pick which position you want beforehand.
good,I really don’t yave much to say other than the facility in la was like working in an Elementary School wilts a lot of yelling loudness horseplay disrespectful people and clearly Untrained management
good,"fast paced, you get couched if your not fast enough. its a good place to work if you need fast cash but in the area its in it wouldn't be good for long term"
good,"Fast paced warehouse job. On your feet all the time, short breaks. Part time, but got to choose the hours you wanted to work. Although there was an air conditioner, it did get quite hot during the summer months."
good,"It is an ok work place. I work 10 hours. Very long on my feet, The company is very fast paced and tiring. Working a lot of hours is not good on my body,"
good,"Take bus to warehouse, as seasonal associates had to park 1 1/2 miles from warehouse.  Once I arrived at building I checked the roaster to see my role for the shift. Next I went and got necessary equipment to perform job duties, normally it was just a scanner. Then we waited for the shift to start and gathered in the front around management to stretch and listen to any important information they needed to relay. After this we all went to our assigned positions, which normally consisted of scanning packages to pallets and trying to keep a scan rate of 190. I learned how to operate a pallet jack and how to wrap pallets for delivery. Management seemed very unorganized and would throw people in positions without proper training. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy boxes over my head. The most enjoyable part of job was when I was selected to do the ""Waterspider"" position. This consisted of closing out full pallets and stickering them for delivery and reopening new pallets."
good,"Work from home, set schedule, changes frequently. You get different managers occasionally so it was hard to get comfortable with a set team. But it was a good experience."
good,loved the atmosphere. it was fun working there despite of it being far from home. great co-workers. i learned how to handle a package and box it up fast and place on the conveyor belt. for it to be shipped on time.
good,I have improved my customer management awareness throughout this position that  I'm actually doing at Amazon as Shipping & Delivery Support | Associate | EU. This is a great opportunity for me to use my languages skills in both French and English by helping delivery drivers and also customers with various queries.
good,Not for lazy people fast paced enviorment pretty strict they are quick to let you go if you dont make quota. You work for vacation hrs. Benefits start day 1 and that includes paid time off.
good,Práce dobra jen to do jizdeni daleko proty co mají děti které chodí do školy a nemají hlídání jinak vše v pohodě .
good,Amazon is a great place to work for young adults. It's very fast paced. The hardest part of the job was the long hours. The managers were Great. They training program is great. Not a hard job at all.
good,I liked working at Amazon but the hours are long and you stand on your feet the whole time. The breaks should be longer and shift cut down to max 8 or 9hrs
good,"Excelente empresa, com grande aceitação no mercado e com equipe de funcionários a altura"
good,Amazon was a flexible job as far as being a contractor for the company. The best of working with amazon was the ability to work when you wanted to and make your own schedule.
good,"Good work and Learning and good benefits."
good,"Overall was a good job , always helped maintian a friendly attitude with customers and was a great experience "
good,"Very busy place to work, typical warehouse enviroment with great people in management positions. Great give aways from the company to its employees for doing outstanding work."
good,It was fast pace and fun environment. complicate and also very differentiate from other jobs that i have been a part of. This job isnt for the faint of heart work hard and get your money.
good,workplace environment work u like a slaveu mhave to stand up for a 10 hours a few breaks                  ...          and u have to keep your rate up
good,While Amazon is a good place to go to buy items online the people that make that happen in their fulfillment centers are treated like cattle. Management changes every month and communication is somewhat non-existent.
good,"Amazon is a good job if you need something quick and that'll pay you pretty well until you find another job. Being a picker is horrible for someone who has a hard time staying on there feet or who is easily winded, you spend 11-12+ hours walking constantly picking items, the management thinks your a robot, they hate to see you have idol time on the clock, and I understand the customer needs are important but we're human and constant walking like that could damage your feet and knees in a big way after while. For people who want to lose weight, it's great exercise and plus you're getting paid for it ."
good,"I have been using their services since long time but for the past few deliveries were very disappointing specifically from hsr bda complex branch, bangalore. Cons: They charge for expressway which should reach by next day eod that's what they tell at the time of taking the package but th"
good,It's a stressful environment . All they care about are their numbers . Their mission statement is work hard have fun and make history but you don't have fun and you really do work hard really hard!!!!
good,"Bonne équipe, et conditions de travail de correct."
good,A very fast paced company. Communication is good while interviewing and accepting a position. Communication is not so good when dealing with people after said job begins.
good,The Job was ok but the bosses where a little prejudice and unreasonable to  different task. The restaurant was in good clean condition and the food was excellent
good,I really liked all of the training we got and the fact that it was very easy to reach out for help if need be.  It can feel very isolating working from home but Amazon did a lot to make everyone part of a team.  Their tools were the best I have ever seen.  The hardest thing is that your very job is based on the review that every customer is sent.  If you only get one returned that week and it is negative that is a ding on the CSR even if they have had 1000 great calls that week. Too many bad weeks or low responding weeks and you can be fired just for the customer reviews and that is a little hard to swallow.  They did frequent opportunities for cross training.
good,We pick alot of orders and brought them to the shipping department and after that we loaded them on the right truck for where it was getting shipped to.
good,"management always changing"
good,"Come into work happy leave very unhappy and wanting to quit."
good,"this is a very grueling job not for the faint of heart, the hours were mandatory 11 hours days 5 days. The job was for the Christmas season rush which lasted 1 month. 5000 people were hired and most of them were laid off at the end of December."
good,"If you love working, this is the place for you.  Zero work-life balance, there is always more to do and why haven't you done it already?  Why haven't you been the star you were hired to be?  "
good,"better benefits needed, great flexibility,great environment,not enough consistency,need better pay for those who started out as contractors using their own car to cover for gas expense,overall a good decent company"
good,"its repetitive boring "
good,"Typically pick the 1st half of the day then pack the rest of the night. Meet people of all ethnic groups."
good,"Prepped product that needed to be prepped that came from the manufacturer, did cart audits, stowed product from the carts into library bins, helped the dock crew unload product from trailers, stack product on pallets, wrap the pallets and plaquered the pallets according company procedures."
good,A fine place to work as a temporary employee.  The company had no plan to produce though.
good,"Great company and face paced environment, great place to have a career. An typical day is being on your feet for 12 hours a day handling customers orders either picking the items from the bins and sending them on the belt up to be package. You learn what the company has to offer and the different products that is being sold. Most enjoyable would be receiving the paycheck at the end of the week. Seeing that all the hard work that your doing is paying off."
good,"Amazon is great place to work.  The development and monitoring tools available to all are simply amazing.    Being able to build to AWS and scale up and scale down-- a breath of fresh air."
good,"10 hr shift, its very easy, didn't really learn much as in job skills. Management is very upbeat but like in all jobs they have their favorites. There's a mix of people which is good. The hardest part is getting off so late and only being able to spend 1 hrs with my kids. The most enjoyable is leaving each night."
good,On any given day i walked anywhere from 15 to 20 miles a day. I learned the process of how things are shipped to the customers. Management was good. Co-workers were good didnt get to interact with them much though. The hardest part of the job was not being able to be home with my wife and son. What i liked most was the competitivness of the job.
good,"typical day;  pull from stock orders from scanner, to sent to packing."
good,again... good pay no stability... they will hire 2000 employees and 3 months later known to fire a vast 99% of the employee hired. Not a company I could see myself reapplying to although i DID LEAVE THE COMPANY IN GOOD STANDINGS
good,opportunity to learn the inside operations of a very large company.
good,management has been compromised due to friendships and alianses.
good,"A nice job if you have no other life, as you spend most of your life on the wrong side of living."
good,"Alot of standing, interacting with people, got to be team motivated,got to be willing to work n work extremely hard"
good,Travail assez physique et répetitif. Bonne ambiance.
good,"Smiles For Miles does not treat certain type of people with respect and or fare Ness they have favorites as in driver's who they rather cater to than judge you off your hard work and accountability, timeliness and teamwork not to mention showing up every day !"
good,Its great if you are only looking for part time work and you are not depending heavily on this paycheck. There is no room for advancement so you will be stuck in the position you are hired for and that is it.
good,Best company with paid maternity leave and paid time off. Opportunities for advancement if you are good at doing what is asked of you. Fun environment.
good,"I love how the managers and most of the employees were friendly when we happen to talk, but it was pretty unnerving how it was mostly quiet though. People mostly just kept to themselves."
good,This job is great job you get to meet people and learn from one another and you learn how to work as a team but they lack great Leadership/Management .
good,"good jpb, part time only and no room to advance. the people were friendly and the management was very helpful delegating job tasks and keeping the day moving smoothly"
good,"Good benefits for part time but very strict on their time off policy.   Hazelwood location is terrible.   A lot of employees do hard drugs to cope with the job.    A lot of physical fights, extreme favoritism, harassment, drama and constant turnover.   Lots of accidents and managers putting productivity before safety.   A lawn mower blade missed my head by an inch ...I was told by a L5 employee I wouldn’t be covered by workman’s comp."
good,"They hire managers on referrals.  Which means anyone who is a manager can refer someone else to a management position.  Regardless of their training and background.  The test for the job is the job.  Which means about five months in, most people who were hired will realize they will not make it in a technology company because they have no training for working there.  So they spend the next 6 months trying to destroy everything and everyone around them, instead of trying to figure out how to do the job or leaving.  Some of those people will figure out that there are enough people in the same boat to organize and start to try and denigrate the rest of the employees. Unfortunately, this is worse for the people who work under these managers as they hold the ability to fire anyone they can find a questionable reason to do so, as long as the other people in the same boat are in the right positions.  It may even get to the point where there are no longer stop-gaps for this behavior, especially when a building is just opening or has had high turnover."
good,"For a company like Amazon, the culture and structure were very disappointing. There was no group comradery, and everyone kept to themselves. There was also minimal support from management."
good,They hiring process is very simple and easy. I was ok with the job until peak season (Christmas season) . They forced everyone to work 12 hour shifts 5 days a week and the job became very stressful and hard on my body.
good,"The work is beyond easy and the goal easily achievable"
good,"Receiving pallets, count item, arrange items on different pallet, wrap, repeat. 10 hours shift 4 days a week (11hs 5 days on peak season). If you are seasonal employee and do the things right you might be hire as full time after peak season."
good,Good pay but be prepared to do nothing but work and sleep for majority of the week. Work isn’t hard but is extremely boring and repetitive. Not for everyone
good,The days were fast and you are paid weekly that is a bonus . fast pace once you look up its pay day. The hardest is driving through different weathers if you are a good driver.
good,I join delivering for Amazon. I love the flexibility. But it can be alot on your vehicle with the mileage and for the pay. But over all it's an income you can work with.
good,It's an opportunity to gain an experience and courses are available if you are interested. Nice atmosphere to work. It's hard work and fast paced. Job security is low .
good,They are not far people over rated fast paced job its almost like slavery your on your feet allway.the people aren't nice and they dont care if there employees are hurt are sick they just want you work
good,Just that  there's no more to say.  I needed a job.  They had one.  It paid and kept me busy. Had good and bad just like anywhere else. Neutral. Only exception was scheduling
good,Poor Management needs to be addressed. Advancement seems to be impossible if you don't have a College Degree or if you're not someone's favorite employee!
good,"Though my experience with Amazon was brief it was also very fulfilling."
good,The People Who Worked There Was Nice . The Job Was Almost .... The mangers was nice it Wasn’t That Hard . For Most It Might Be .........But I Didn’t Like The Hours
good,You cant easily transfer shifts or request days off. They make you use your time for everything. It doesnt matter if you have a note from the hospital saying you cant work or not.you have to use your time.
good,If u like exercise this is job for u!! This job is a walk a thon!! Good money! Breaks suck they really need to change the break system! From scan to scan that’s ridiculous u never really get it 15 min break and and only get 30 min lunch for working 12 hours shifts! Unacceptable
good,"Typical day: Clock in, stretch, get volume for the day, get your job assignment, do your job until everyone is finished, break, then you start picking and clock out!"
good,"I still cannot believe that  I worked there for 13 months. I wish that physically I could still work that pace but I cannot :( the atmosphere is a job that has rotation , high pace, multiple cultures, OT, plus you are reviewed and advised for improvement.(continual low out put or ""horsing around""and you're dismissed)"
good,This job is not for u if u are a outspoken person.  They say they care about you but they really dont. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that i know. I keep hearing all the rumors from people who dont work there and its true. The managers are no where to be found.  All they do is walk around with their laptops and come to u when u receive a write up
good,It is a varied work experience from job to job as well as locations. The cross Docks are not as bad as the Fulfillment centers. They have rate per hour in most positions. When I left they werre looking at establishing some for forklift drivers as well.
good,Mi ero creata molte aspettative da questa Azienda avevo lavorato per 8 mesi ininterrotti e nonostante venni da loro considerata per il turno notturno sono stata invece “messa da parte” da un messaggio squallido dell’Agenzia interinale la quale mi diceva che era già il quarto rinnovo e nn potevo proseguire. A questo punto mi sono chiesta se Amazon punta sulla professionalità e volontà dei suoi lavoratori. Pazienza ormai me ne sono fatta una ragione ma provo parecchio dispiacere.
good,"A typical day went pretty fast and smooth, with work constantly coming in you didnt even see when the time when by. I love the idea that i was able to train in more than one department during the time i was there and the dounut shift i was able to work which was monday, tuesday, thursday, and friday with my weekends off."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work for anyone interested in a change of pace, a new career path or a solid first job that offers great benefits like tuition assistances and schedule accomadations for classes. It's difficult to get much in the way of upward movement and nearly impossible to bridge the gap between hourly and salary without a bachelors. I definitely recommend but with the warning that you will be going up against several hundred applicants for every posting you apply for, so bear that in mind."
good,"I have faced everything here- a bad work culture, a poor work life balance, very bad management. Warehouse culture is not good and I won't recommend anyone to work in warehouse. If you get central role in headquarters, then it is fine."
good,They really didn’t care if you had a life or things to do long as their packages were delivered. The pay was ok but not enough for the amount of work you have to do daily
good,"Amazon is not a terrible place to work in as the internet would have you believe but it is physically and mentally straining if your not made for that kind of work, I have been at Amazon for 10 months and it has been wearing me down for the past 3. I do recommend the job to anyone who wants a lot of money really quick but for long term I wouldn't recommend it."
good,"Surprised that there was so much turnover, job changing, and decentralization of all the departments. "
good,"It was your typical warehouse job. Lots of walking and lots of people you do not talk to what so ever. Long hours and little sleep. If you get a promotion it may be worth it to stay for a long time, but not for $12 a hour."
good,Amazon.com is a good place to work if you need taxable position are willing to have your shifts move around week to week. The software can sometimes be difficult but the company responds to input and corrects things as quick as possible
good,"A typical day requires a lot of lifting, pushing, and pulling.  It is a great job to have because it requires a lot of energy and keeps you in shape.  However, during peak seasons such as during the major holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas as an Amazon associate is required to work 60 hours per week.  The last peak I had worked in November and December we work straight 60 hours per week and it was mandatory.  This can be very tiring and puts a lot of strain on ones body."
good,"Amazon was a very physically demanding workplace. It was extremely fast paced and stressful at times but it was also sometimes fun and had a very diverse atmosphere. There is an excessive amount of hours and mandatory overtime. They offer a fair wage and provide generous benefits. They also have constant rewards, competitions and offer plenty of incentives."
good,"My time at Amazon in Cape Town has been an adventurous experience. "
good,"In theory, this could be a great workplace, especially for those without a higher degree or advanced training. What ruins it, among other things, are 1) the employees who lack respect for one another and the job 2) leadership playing favorites and letting some associates follow different rules 3) a lack of respect for the job itself, some of my coworkers treat Amazon like it is prison and you must form alliances to survive. It is truly astounding how terrible they make the work environment and how ungrateful they are for a full-time job that pays $15.00 per hour."
good,"Work is easy, though can be very physically taxing, and well worth it for the Pay..."
good,"Amazon is definitely a place of business. It requires you to come in and do your job and do it well. Attendance is a must! Tardiness, laziness and insubordination will get you terminated."
good,Ive been here for over year amazon does not treat people who has been there and or know what they are doing very well. they are willing to fire anyone for the simplest thing.
good,"Our team got an escalation form vendor regarding payment of Invoice I had ensured that all obstacles are cleared and made immediate payment where we have obtained Customer Obsession. "
good,"I learned how to manage by being organized so things don’t get out of control,"
good,"Was a packer, 3rd shift was OK job.  Not a lot of chance to advance in timely manor.  Only once per year were you able to apply to change shifts or  job function.  If no degree, had to work there 3 years to go into management."
good,"Amazon provided me with an opportunity to work in a warehouse. I was able to learn to use a pallet jack, unload trucks and pull items for shipping. Amazon has a diverse group of employees, the environment can be very stressful at times."
good,"My manager was phenomenal and was really reliable and trustworthy but of course there are some bad apples out there that aren't like my manager whom have a management position. Also HR is really unprofessional and rude to their associates and don't understand that life isn't all about work, everyone has personal things that go on in their life and they don't seem to comprehend that."
good,Very fast paced competitive and produxtive work environment Great company to work for and grow with I would recommend this wrehohse job for anyone looking for  a job
good,Good health n safety policies. Busy.  Long hours.  Less breaks. 4 days work in a week. Great security.  Cooperative people. Helpful managers. Work in a team
good,Very strenuous and overly fast paced. Under constant pressure by management for time and accuracy. Needs more employees to reach expected goals. I believe the pay should be higher considering the strenous work involved. Management looks at negative performance rather than positive.
good,Not very supportive ofemployees. Lots of favoritism . Hard Labor work. Long hours and Days of work.  Management is unexperienced managers who have never done the same job.
good,"A typical day was easy, they do push you to do better than yesterday. I would recommend this company to other people looking for a side job. It is an easy way to earn some money on the side."
good,"Long hours and mandatory overtime "
good,You can expect to work hard and be accountable for your work.  You should make sure that you're not in the bottom 10-15% performance on your team.  Be sure to be in your boss's inner circle to improve your chances of not being eliminated.
good,"Instead of promoting based on actual production this place just moves the high achievers to another area and doesn't speak to them at all.  Management is not concerned with the workers advancement or development at all.  The job is easy but there is no incentive to try harder or work faster.  After a couple weeks it is boring to work there, and not much options to advance quickly."
good,I enjoy working for Amazon I learned some new skills just not enough of hours. They never hire as a full time worker so you never get the full benefits aside from that it was a great learning experience sometimes the work load was more and sometimes we had relaxing days but overall if you looking to make a little money for a lot of work this would be the perfect job
good,Would work for again if they would actually treat us better. Many times people are left for dead in the workplace as far as growing with the the company.
good,"Amazon prime is a great place to work if you need to make extra money and need flexible hours. I met some great people there, but a lot of the management is unorganized."
good,"Amazon is a job that you can work as a second job, It's not a place that you really live off of. The overall place of working at was exciting and you had to be quick and on your  toes at all time. I would tell others about this job it is a fun job and the supervisor was cool people."
good,"It’s a good first job but there is no room for career advancement as an associate. If you start off as a manager, then it’s a very good environment to develop yourself"
good,"O horário é ótimo, trabalhamos de segunda a sexta 9 horas por dia, aprendi muito aqui desde faturamento a manusear o sistema SISREG, da secretaria de saúde."
good,hired management from students right out of college who never knew what it was like to work in warehouse .one manager had a degree in sports management and never worked a day in a warehouse
good,"Amazon is a good place to work if you can walk a lot, if you need decent money. They aren't the best with working around your schedule if you have school or kids."
good,It is really annoying that even if i were to sit down to tie my shoe i would get yelled at for sitting down or how when i would go get a drink or use the bathroom i would get wrote up for time off task
good,If you're over 30 you're not advancing anywhere even with a degree. HR is mostly women and think you work directly for them. Someone should let them know they represent the needs of the employees.
good,"Reviewed from your website that the company rarely advances within the company. Job requirements are focused on maintaining high scan rates, monitor time frame between scan rates to monitor individuals productivity, break time is allotted for 15 minutes but you must be back at your position before the 15 minutes are up. Management at times lacks positive interaction with employees to help inspire better production of its employees. Trying to het trained at other positions is hard to achieve from the lack of trainers. Workplace culture and attitude from employees is different day to day because the main focus is the scan rates with most employees do a sub-par job of stacking pallets and leave the work for someone else to fix. Most enjoyable part of the job are not all employees there have appositive attitude and take pride in their work and are team players."
good,"Amazon is the biggest company in the world."
good,"You work hard, but they do their best to promote fun within your working environment. Unfortunately, does not seem to be best for job advancement. A great place I'd think for young people."
good,"I was hired for seasonal employment, and I was offered post-Christmas employment. I decided to look for more challenging employment after my four 3 month contract assignment was completed."
good,"not much benefits for part-timers and they didn't do their best to be accommodate their ""fresh"" part timers like they promised on the day they told us that they will get rid of the OAK 6 Fresh in Tracy location."
good,"Work had, work fast and be right a lot. Fun, open minded diverse work environment  but cut throat. Compensation: Low salary and high shares. benefits are ok."
good,Grossly underpaid for the work that you do  and what they expect you to do. The rates with which they expect you to stock your items is virtually impossible even for veteran employees. Trainer did not train was more interested in socializing.
good,if you like to get written up for things like rate and you like to loose wt its a great place to work. hard to advance however the managers are good to work with you
good,It is very competitive and fast paced.  You had to make a rate or you would be written up. Very stressful.  Start out with maybe 1 day of training and then you were left on your own.
good,"I learned a lot at Amazon.com, specifically as a Team Leader in charger of on boarding and training new associates. I also got a lot more experience in the field of logistics which goes hand in hand with HR. I advanced my technical and quantitative skills as wells cognitive thinking and decision making in a fast-paced work environment."
good,"Was a very labor intensive job with tough performance requirements. Worked seasonal positions in 2009, 2013, and 2017 at Amazon in the Picking, Sorting, Packing, Shipping, and Receiving departments."
good,"They tend to over hire, and lunch breaks are too short for the amount of people there are. However, the pay is great, if you can get over the mandatory 60 hours a week. You spend long hours on your feet, but do receive full benefits."
good,lots of standing but was fun to work there got to meet new people. So I enjoy the time they had me there. if I had a chance to stay I would have stayed
good,"Bonne entreprise ou je retournerais sans problème en cas d'appel."
good,"People do not take their jobs seriously and others team members end up doing over their share.  Managers do not manage effectively and are often on their cell phones.  Workers are encouraged to work by managers yelling ""encouraging"" phrases to them.  It isn't a bad job but I wish it was a little more quiet and people could work together better."
good,"Overall I think Amazon could be a great place to work. I will honestly say in the beginning it's a decent job, fast paced and keeps you learning... However, the more time I invest into this company I've learned that moving up isn't as easy as they make it seem."
good,good company to work for. Very busy with phone calls and customer issues. Training was easy. Hardest part of the job was knowing all that was expected of you if you hadnt done thos work before. also trying to get answers from leadership can be difficult at times. Also they assure you that even though its seasonal you could most likely stay on and thats not the case.
good,"In comparison to my current job, Amazon lacked leadership, and direction. Department was poorly managed, and caused a large number of talents to leave the company."
good,"Warehouse jobs are exhausting and require a lot out of you physically in general, but if you don't mind warehouse work then Amazon is the perfect fit. I would definitely work for this company again. Amazon really takes care of you and really cares about your health and safety."
good,I liked working there but if you are a night person like I was putting in for night time shift would not be good. I leaned a lot working for amazon and would do it again.
good,Good for good. Very competitive. Burnout is a big issue as employees are worked to the peak. Worked for 6 months and left to due going back to school. Location was DFW7 Fort Worth Fulfillment Center.
good,"Having worked with the company for a few years, without any chance to advance my career, I feel it is now time to move on and seek new challenges and chances in my work life."
good,Very fast paced and hectic work environment. Pay was good. But work hours are brutal.10-12 hour days (Minimum) with 6-7 day work weeks. Employee turnover rate is high which is not good.
good,"I learned so much at Amazon. The company is quick to change, uses measurable data to make decisions, and is incredibly innovative. When you leave Amazon, you're years ahead in skill sets to any of your counterparts. "
good,Fast paced. Learn fast. Stressful environment. Short breaks. You walk alot so its great exercise. Great potential to move to management. Great pay. No benefits unless you are an Amazon employee. Integrity does not offer insurance.
good,"In the short time I worked there, the HR (Human Resources) dept. did not help me nor did they at least act like they cared about me as a human. Disappointing."
good,Amazon's a great place to work. I just don't get along with my Manager. She's a terrible person. THis this and that and stuff. Stuff to fill space. There ya go more words.
good,"It was constantly on your feet, you were going non-stop. There was mandatory overtime several times throughout the summer. It was really only a summer job."
good,"It's a good place for people that do not like working with the general public. However, if you work there part-time, you do not get the benefits you would think."
good,"Amazon overall is a great company , however the contractor companies are a hassle to deal with. To prepare yourself for your shift it's always best to have a great breakfast and stay hydrated"
good,"Bonne entreprise, Bonne ambiance et condition de travail correct"
good,"no life/work balance if you work the late shift. management is ok, some managers are very mean. it's a fast paced place and employees are replaceable fast."
good,Not enough hours. No increase in wage. Managers dont do anything but stand around looking at their computers but besides that its a boring but easy job.
good,some of the people in charge shouldn't be because they were unfit  to lead. They clearly showed favoritism and openly harassed some people who disagreed with anything they felt wasn't working hard enough.
good,Had our morning stretches than went to our location to work our 4 hours.  I was able to learn to gaylord dump and be looked down for other things. Management sucked
good,your always working to beat the clock. they promise the possibility of getting hired but the reality of it is your there just to fill orders until the Christmas rush is over
good,"Bonne compétence d'apprentissage "
good,If you like working heavy labor job and not get recognized for your work then would recognized working here beside having multipal manger their and only having at most 2 knowing what to do when the clock is running
good,"ok, hard work but can be boring as doing the same thing every night, they're always watching your every move, security walking round, getting scanned and having to sign out to go to the toilet, but there are people there who are a bit light fingered, but they get found out, get on with the job and you'll be alright."
good,"The people are great and make the job more fun however often times you are talked at instead of talked to by leadership, other than that it's a great company. It would be nice if there were more advancement opportunities."
good,"Easy job, but poor leadership guidance and management. Great flexible hours, pay could be a lot better for how large the company is.  If pay and discount was increased would be a better postion."
good,Overall great company just need more dependable  training and support from  peers and leadership and take criticism to better the overall lifestyle within Amazon.
good,It's a warehouse. They hire and fire people daily. They give great benefits and we work long hard strenuous hours. There is lots of opportunity for advancement.
good,"Travail que j'ai le plus apprécié même si le temps d'adaptation est long,"
good,"I enjoyed most days at work because I worked along side other hard working individuals accomplishing same goal getting packages out timely, and efficiently. I learned that sometimes accomplishing the company goals are more important than an individuals needs or preferences. Management for my specific area was great, the supervisor listened to ones needs without bias, tried to be fair. My coworkers were great, I trained many of my co workers, many went on to be supervisors, or in management positions. The most enjoyable part of my job at Amazon was having the opportunity to be an Ambassador, which is a trainer for large amounts of employees at peak season. This was very rewarding for me."
good,a typical work day at amazon is very busy and long other then standing for ten hours always on your feet you are constantly working really fast to make rate being here I learned the process of what it take to ship out a item and all the steps one little order goes through management was okay fun kept everyone with a smile on their face co workers was nice you get to meet people of all different backgrounds the hardest part of this job is making sure you make rates you could your hardest and sometimes you think you make rate and you don't the most enjoyable part is meeting the new people
good,Typical work day was 12-14 hours but the work was only 4 days a week.  Definite environment full of continuous change.  Good place for the ambiguous learner.
good,"Tough job, but decent pay. Just keep hydrated. Fast pace for sure, a lot of walking. They will keep you busy throughout your shift."
good,The benefits are okay yet the structure of whom you need to discuss things with gets difficult and time consuming. The company itself is great to work for the only hard part is dealing with some of the other associates. I mean it really does have more pros than cons.
good,"Was trained in different areas throughout the warehouse. Management was okay, there were a few wonderful managers when I started but they all quit a year into working there.   The hardest part of my job was the walking.  Most enjoyable was the health benefits."
good,I have been out there for over 2 years and 3 peek seasons. This is not the place to work if you want a life outside of the company or have a family. You are constantly tired and barely have any time for family
good,"Hi, i'm fairly young , played many sports in school and i saw this job as a learning experience no doubt it was and tho i wouldve loved to keep working there the hours and shifts they make are horrible but the pay and the necessity keep you there. I went to a couple diferent warehouses and the culture is diferent in each one however they are all the same way in the sense of getting anything done, You want to visit your grandmother in hospital? Call a number wait a few hours then be told you cant. They do offer some benefits but honestly its not worth not being with your family and the toll the shifts have on your mind and body."
good,"Very fast pace , Customer service importance , Business needs, Team work , Overcoming obs-tickles , Knowing our team got the job done on time ."
good,Was a great job when they were busy but  they were slow I would drive from York to Lewisberry and not have my 8 hours. I had a family to proved for so i applied at Performance and got a better job.
good,overall pretty good job. I liked how all the employees were always open to help out other co-workers and the cleanliness of the warehouse.
good,"It was nice working in such a diverse workplace and I made some good friends which made coming to work more fun.  Did not always feel like management was as knowledgeable as what they should have been and when you are hired, you are told that your assignment will be for at least six months but, it will usually only be until the seasonal rush has ended.  The focus is more on your negative response rate than on your actual job so they are very much about the numbers."
good,"Most days I get in early so I can get my routes done and be ready for the team meeting. On a typical day last week, we had a late change from the client to deal with. I got my shift manager to do a quick technical feasibility analysis whilst I went to see the Account Manager. She explained how important it was, so I reviewed the plan and found a way to get the change in without harming the critical path. The team weren't too happy to have to squeeze in another change, but when I explained how helpful it would be to the customer they got down to updating the specification and use cases. I bought in pizzas to keep them all happy and to let us steal a bit of space at lunchtime, We'd got it done by three and,got everything else back on track by the end of the day."
good,My work is based on rates and production. Can be very competitive. A lot of room for improvement regarding management. Very friendly co-workers.
good,"Once the day is started we get our duties for the day, management informs us if any changes are made. You have to be open for change because your job duties change very often. Its a fast moving environment. Which makes your day go by fast."
good,"Amazon is a great company as a customer. However most promotion above management is external, and internal advancement is few and far between. It can be very frustrating on top of the hectic call center environment where most days calls are back to back. There are nice monetary incentives if you make goal that is spread out company, not site wide. They offer several areas to work in and jobs to shadow, though the pay is generally all the same and caps out at $14 per hour. It is a great place to work if there are not many $10 per hour jobs in your area, but if you are ambitious it can be very limiting."
good,At amazon you work 10 hours day for 4 days. if you work for amazon you start off at 12/hour. Your on your feet for about 9 hours a day. Learn the job fast more importantly learn the shortcuts and tricks fast.
good,Has got a very good brand name. But working in night shifts and going to new places with little intimation became difficult.
good,"Cette usine a une très bonne organisation le matin en arrivant sur notre cellule nous avons une feuille avec tout les noms dessus pour savoir se qu l'on fait durant notre journée de travail."
good,"With a vast amount of positions within in this facility there opportunities everywhere."
good,"Les horaires sont du 2/8, le matin de 5h40 à 12h50 ou l'aprés midi de 13h10 à 20h20, avec 30 minutes de pause divisé par 2 fois 15 minutes."
good,the benefits are awsome and i like the way vacation is obtained.
good,"I usually had to be up by 5am to be there at 6:30am, traffic was always bad. I learned basics on how to scan and arrange items. The management was alright if you could find them and we weren't allowed to really converse with the co-workers apart from our breaks, although that suited me fine, but overall the co-workers were nice. The hardest part was probably standing for so long and getting up super early however I really didn't mind after awhile. The most enjoyable part was the work, sending off the orders wondering who it was for and imagining scenes of when the package arrives and I am sure that sounds very silly but it was my favorite part and kept me going all day."
good,I would start work by clocking in and then pack until break. I would then have to clock out until I was going to be packing again which would be after a 15 minute break. I would then work again up until lunch which i would get half hour for. I would then clock back in and work until break which i would get another 15 minutes for. I would then work until the end of my shift. The hardest part of the job was being on my feet for so long as you stand while you are packing and the most enjoyable was having the people i worked with around me.
good,"•	Pick customers orders on all levels of a multi-level mezzanine."
good,"Customer escalated queries"
good,it was an okey place to work but the hours and night shift was hard on my kids and I.
good,"Good place to work, has an ok atmosphere.  Pay is average and hours are long."
good,they would send us home regularly because their wasn't enough work.
good,"Its factory work. Its what you make it to be, over all not a bad place to work, but your feet will hurt from walking so much."
good,"Uma Boa Empresa para se trabalhar, organizada paga direitinho boa comunicação a escala era 5x1 por um, era mais ou menos mais era tranquilo."
good,easy place to grow and move up
good,"They grade you on everything you do, even knowing when you go to the restroom."
good,"the job and pay was good, the people were also helpful and friendly. the hours were long, usually 10 hours a day, 6 days a week"
good,"La mia esperienza in Amazon è stata molto interessante. "
good,There was no pressure for me to try out new methods and I got along with my work colleagues.It help me to enjoy my work more and grew inconfidence in what I was doing
good,"* We can take work from home"
good,One typical day at work was when was not ok and my workers make me feel better. I learn to always be myself the management is perfect the workplace culture is fine they don’t care about your culture the hardest part of the job is lifting the most enjoyable thing of the job is being around the employees
good,"Amazon was a good company. Definitely could work on the mangers, I don't think a business that big should be having a new manger every month. Overall it was a good job"
good,Intéressant  comme travaille  bonne d'expérience  très belle équipe
good,they are flexiable with hours but over work you while youre on the clock and its almost impossible to move up in higher positions. you only get 10 minute breaks
good,"It's really what you make of it. You can easily move around within the company, as the opportunities for advancement are pretty good. Needless to say, management can tend to show favor to certain employees. It's all about who you know."
good,Je trouve l'entreprise stressante d'être toujours sur le dos des employer
good,They provided a laptop and several items to provide a secure connection.  Any issues you have they setup a conference call and help resolve the issue quickly.
good,"Some people who are friendly with management get easier tasks.  The work is far too strenuous and hours are too long for the compensation given and I believe that is the reason why so many people, after working for a short period of time, leave the job.  "
good,"Hours not guaranteed "
good,"It's the first of its kind with the way the warehouse is setup, I can't really say much as they prohibit such talk outside of the facility so nobody knows too much. But with it being new, theres going to be bumps along the way, but with as big as Amazon is, you'd surely think they couldn't let something this new and dear to the tops heart get this way. Management is 4.5/5 and the job is easy, just don't push yourself too far because there won't be compensation coming back your way. Just like every job, they have check marks and X's. You just gotta decide where you're willing to compromise."
good,Dock clerk job is really interesting. We face new challenges everyday and that is the fun part. This is the kind of job where you need it to be super busy. Time runs by really quick.
good,Job times isn’t flexible at all. Amazon Managers just worry about hitting numbers not about people’s well being. Impossible to get off. Vacation time is hard to gain
good,"Its only part time and you can pick extra hours but its not easy doing that,"
good,"I felt that after 6 years of Amazon management, it became clear that this was a place that rewards who you know and who you are friendly with more than what you know and what you have truly earned. Attractive cool people do very well here, family men and women not so much."
good,"The job isn’t bad but the culture of the people is something to keep in mind. Like any other job and or school it’s a popularity contest.  No one has been blatantly mean to me  but you can tell when someone is talking about you. Especially if you’re new. If you are an introvert like me, many people won’t like you so there won’t be anyone to chat to during down times (there is a lot of down time at this job) also let’s say you get an order of like 70 items, obviously it’s hard to complete alone so if you’re not friends with someone you’re on your own. I also dislike the fact that we constantly have to bother Whole Foods employees when an item is not found. "
good,"Shift usually start keeping us pretty busy but the ends of shifts are usually quite slow and relaxed which is nice. However, because of the relative newness of the job, it's very hard getting shifts so I wouldn't suggest it as a main source of income."
good,It was okay . I’ve heard it’s better now . They give you more hours . The pay is better . The points you receive for attendance most times is unfair. Other than that it’s a very independent job
good,"Lack of communication is stressful and there isn't as much emphasis or concern on employee morale, which greatly affects their workforce. They do seem to care about you for the most part in certain instances, however."
good,"fast paced, friendly associates, wake, work, wash, sleep, repeat....but 3 days off in a row, so worth it.................................................."
good,a good job for short time but not for long time it is  in think it is not for life time job it is good for 1 persion but not for family man i belives in life time job
good,"Screening of items purchased by the customer giving feed back and system update."
good,"Relaxing and friendly environment, team accepting workspace, free spaced and innovative work atmosphere and ideas, No senior/junior behavior, knowledgeable, culture respecting, hardest part of the job would be the team politics and most enjoyable would be the way the team worked together, supporting each other at every step."
good,"Amazon was fun for the first couple of months. But as time went past i came to learn that it wasn't really that much fair working there. By that i mean the weekly hours were unreasonable, your fellow employees aren't to be trusted, and managers aren't fair to the some of the people on their team."
good,"Working for Amazon was great and I would recommend this to my friends."
good,"Fun for some, people are nice but they don't really care how their pallets are shipped out as long as your scans are fast and you have a high scanner number"
good,"overall it is a great place to work - management has poor communication with employees and does not give some an opportunity for improvement.   Expectations are high - 10 seconds to stow a package, and you are given 1 day to correct it."
good,I learned a lot of myself during my time with amazon. After a while I felt that my being there really had no impact on the company and I felt I needed to find a job/career that makes a bigger impact on our world today.
good,"amazon was a pretty cool job you'll typically have cool coworkers, management is hit or miss you'll have cool ones or terrible ones, its strict & boring though can't listen to music which has a reasonable explanation on why you can't, people are typically pretty helpful, safety is preached a lot there but actions on it don't follow up as much you can be put in some pretty dangerous situations working here and the safety crew is slow and very lazy you'll be waiting all day for them to come aid you in situations that slow you down on doing your job. worst thing about here is you have multiple ways to get fired, you have a time off task, a rate, safety can get you in trouble as well as petty coworkers that are in the same field as you AND the ones that aren't. overall its a cool job go there get your money and go home and you shouldn't have any problems HOPEFULLY."
good,"Easy job if you can stay focused on your work and not walk around talking to people. If in receiving, you must keep scanning items to make your rate. If you're in the bottom 5% of receivers, you will get verbal and written write ups which can lead to termination. You can wear pretty much whatever as long as it's not too revealing and you must wear a safety vest and gloves provided by Amazon. There is room for advancement."
good,"I work part-time in a sort center. The work is so simple that training for most roles can typically be accomplished in about 5 minutes or less while the more advanced roles require at least 20 minutes. The work is sometimes hard, sometimes easy, and always redundant. "
good,Management is unrealistic about rates and constantly trying to write people up for time off task. Dont go to the inbound dept necause there is no space to store items and people do not say excuse me!
good,"This company is amazing and offers sooo many benefits to its employees from the tier I and upward. However, this specific fulfillment center is AWFUL! The work load is easy and it's just full of shoes, however the building management promotes and encourages a toxic work environment among leadership. I regret trying to obtain this Tier III position."
good,"Great company to work for but hard to advance to the next level. Great atmosphere and offices within easy reach of shops, gym, parks etc. Company transport available depending on hours of work"
good,"Very fast paced workplace. They must consider allocation of jobs in relation with age, education and fitness of and employee. Every one should not treated equal. "
good,I worked with Amazon for almost 2 years for the most part I enjoyed my job they trained me to drive a standup forklift a center rider an standby clamp  most of the management are to busy to help but there was some good ones to the hr team sucks though I am a single father an when I need resources an help to keep my job they seemed not to care so I ended up losing my job do to babysitting issues
good,You have to make it fun place to work. It is hard work and standing on your feet for 10 or 12 hours a day with a 30 minute lunch. besides that awesome
good,It was tough learning everything fresh if you have no idea what all of their abbreviations mean. Management tries to be hands on and the typical work day varies on what you do withing the company. If you only have to make a living then Amazon is perfect for you. But it's not a great fit if your in school.
good,"Schedule conflicted with personal needs."
good,"I work with Amazon for a period of 4 months. It was my first job in Canada."
good,Very easy job takes time to learn but very hard to keep up with your time managment. Would work here again but id need better job security.Warhouse is very work friendly.
good,Amazon is a good place to start if you have little experience and no education or an education in a field that is not yielding results at the moment. Is good money with good benefits but a poor life work balance and stressful work environment.
good,"Overall work is work. There are stressful days, especially when every 3 months there's a new system to learn or on development. It would be really worth it of it was full time."
good,"Hours and job was perfect for me due to the fact that it was part time. However I was deceived when they stressed the fact that they were keeping ppl on after peak season, yet ended up letting everyone go after the holidays."
good,"Not fond of my last Fulfillment experience. Being a female, was scanning and lifting heavier items (gallons of antifreeze, bottles of liquid cleaners, pots, blenders, laptop cover/bundles, than my male counterparts to scan - while they were lifting socks and vitamin bottles). In comparison, would prefer to only work at the Sortation center (where I started)!"
good,Over all Good job. Hated the mandatory overtime especially when there was not a full 24 advanced notice.  The younger managers seem very clickish and seemed unfair. I enjoyed the more mature manager as there general work experience lent them more personable toward staff.
good,"As a direct hire NON CONTRACT Amazon driver delivering packages for the first time ever it was stressful because I could have up to 300 packages on the truck and have to get them out as quickly as possible. It's a learning curve but I caught on quickly. The best part about the job is that you work solo and there's no one looking over your shoulder but beware should you work too slow and fall behind dispatch will nag you. They will call you 100x to find out what's going on and if you're still alive out there. Knowing how to get around the city and finding the right address is obviously key to the job. It is a very fast-paced job. You literally have seconds to find the package, scan it, get it to the door, take a pic, knock and move on. Therefore it is important to be highly organized in the truck and have a method to the madness. The good thing is that they will send rescues (help) if needed. I worked at the facility in New Castle De---before they built the drive-in. So we worked pretty hard pushing 6ft carts weighing up to 100lbs or more (in packages) out into the yard for staging. We would then walk nearly a mile to the next parking lot to retrieve Amazon vans, bring them around to the lot and then load them for delivery. This whole process could often take up to two hours out of a 10h shift and got to be pretty annoying for drivers. If this sounds like a lot, it was. This is a very physically demanding job and not for the faint of heart. Everybody part will hurt even the ones you didn't know you had. You have to be aware of your surroundings especially be mindful of dogs in"
good,"Amazon is a great company to work for if you are interested in part time, employees are what make it, we work hard unloading and distributing over sixty thousand packages per night"
good,"It is easy to get the job.  They give the best jobs on referrals, because they want the people to feel in control of the business.  But most of the people do not realize that the test for your job is your job.  You will be given projects to complete that have already been vetted at corporate.  Your job is to prove you can keep up and do the work.  Most people think that all they need to do is show up and look good until the reviews for work start coming in and they realize they don't know what going on and they tried to find out and they are now months behind on projects that must pass testing and evaluation in a couple of months, usually by start of Christmas season when all project adjustments are locked down.  Unfortunately, because they allow hiring on referral, you will have people who have degrees in finance, operational management, accounting referred to jobs in application development and programming.  So, people who realize they have been setup to fail, will start trying to take down everyone around them as the year long testing comes to an end.  People who pass will however, get numerous opportunities to keep job transferring to find their happy place."
good,"Hardest thing about working for the Amazon FC is the 10 hour work days but its only 4 days and then you have 3 days off. There is a lot of walking and no sitting because it is a fast-paced environment. The perks and the loose, ""high school"" , fun atmosphere are what's great about Amazon, but the management could do a better job of communicating information to the lower level employees."
good,"Amazon is a good place to work, you just have to be flexible with hours assigned.  Was a Good experience were training me on the forklift however due to my own things going on at home had to resign."
good,Rushed and unorginized. Temporary workers could careless about their jobs. They had some good christmas perks and plenty of overtime to choose from but their point system for tardies or sick days a bit extreme.
good,It is hard on the body and if you don't properly investing in the insurance and benefits properly long term the job is not worth the quick money they give you. Things are constantly changing so you have to backbone to survive here!
good,Fun times @ PHL7! Management could always improve at any company I'm sure.. but the rest of the job was easy enough and rarely tired me overall.. Would go back if it changed in it's management style.
good,Amazon Fulfillment  Center  jobs are for those who don't mind being on your feet for long periods  of time . Those that don't mind not  dealing with customers  and the out side world for ten hours a day just Co-workers.
good,Hardest part of the job was having to deal with other team members choosing the lighter stuff while some got stuck lifting the heavier stuff. The people who work there are very nice it became like a family instead of a team after a little while.
good,Flexible work schedule. Learning new things about the company everyday. The management change almost every six months. Very diverse. People all over the world not only work for Amazon but shop the website as well. Overall good place to work.
good,They have potential but they treat their employees like machines that they don’t really care about.  If this were a union job that protected their workers and offered more stability then this would be a great job.
good,"Senior mgmnt. tries hard to motivate positivity at the workplace... ---but often, it's the mid-level mgmnt. that drops the ball. ------There's far too many {young and emotional...} staff members -with personal agendas and axes to grind... [ Egotism and favoritism... trumps the efficiency and overall ""focus"" ...of getting the job done RIGHT!!! ]"
good,"I get a workout every day I work. Fast pace, always doing something. Supervisors are always willing to help. If you are looking for fast pace, always on your feet moving this is great. If your looking to sit around and do nothing look some where else. We are there to get the packages to the customers in the safest and fastest way."
good,"second shift could be better, at times they will have too many workers for the day other too few. changing in team size put a strain on the group as a whole"
good,"Managers could definitely be better. "
good,"El empleo es cansado aunque no mucho a diferencia de otros similares, algo que me agradó mucho fue que toman muy en serio la seguridad dentro del almacén, así que te sientes seguro."
good,A typical night shift at Amazon involves strong commitment and dedication to achieving results. The work is intense and physically demanding. Colleagues can be friendly.
good,"Great company you would want to work for if you like being on the cutting edge of business, improving processes and improving metrics. Work Life balance sucks for Management, unrealistic KPI's that are almost impossible to meet, Senior management is rushed into positions and most are not people managers, just data driven robots mowing through human capital. Management can expect 11-12 hour days 5 days a week and living next to your laptop and email over the weekends. Great job for the single recent college graduate, NOT for ANYONE with a family."
good,On a typical day I would load my can and then start my route to deliver packages. My manager managed us very poorly. We rarely got to speak our mind on any issues or we would be written up. The easiest part of the job is just showing up. The hardest part was dealing with my manager.
good,"They would constantly let you know that you were replaceable, and I didn’t like that. It does breed a good work environment, and it showed with everyone’s attitude so worked there"
good,"We did not have direct managers, we were bike messengers. It was very self run. We mostly interacted with an app on our phones. Other messenger jobs were better, but Amazon did pay well compared to others."
good,"I Loved it. I Worked from home for holiday season. Great extra money and flexible time. Managers changed 3x in 6 months so that got frustrating, was very hard to reach managers to get a question answered but I didn’t need them often."
good,"Show up and prepare to work. If you do not click with your initial management, you have no chance of moving up in the company. They grade your process in an abstract and unclear way."
good,"Amazon works you like a slave, fast paced ,being stressed out long hours I called out for a family emergency and received a warning they pressure you alot and hurry you it's a good pay but not worth your health ."

good,"early mornings "
good,"Very limited training, lack of communication from middle and upper management, animosity from upper management, lack of sensitivity training. Exhausti"
good,"Employees appear energetic and happy to work at Amazon"
good,"Amazon is a fast paced work environment. You are allowed some paid breaks. The security there is serious. When seasonal work picks up, your allowed to make a lot of overtime. I didn't like the you had to do everything online, which was confusing and you always need assistant which was hard to come by. There were so many supervisor's you get confused of who to go to for particular situations."
good,"I'm not gonna go crazy on here because most of us heard about the workplace experience of Amazon associates. The place is so great and so bad at the same time. The pros and cons of this place is are high on both ends. I, can definitely tell you this place isn't great for anyone with children because of work hours and the ever unpredictability of your schedule being changed and there is nothing you can do about it. It's either take this new shift or leave. I'm not gonna sit here and bash this place either because when it's good it's good and it can create excellent opportunity within and outside of the company."
good,"you get to pick your own schedule and work around it, the hours are hard to get sometimes and it really causes you stress, people are fun to work with and you get the freedom to use your own clothing, as long as you wear closed shoes."
good,very demanding and hard work work with strict time limits and targets to be met within those time limits. typical day would include picking and packing items to be delivered.
good,The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers that wish to stay angry the whole time call after call. Managers are generally nice and want to help. HR and appointed helpers always are planning fun stuff to lift morale.
good,If you're a quick learner then the training and the actual job is easy. They move at an extremely fast pace and expect you to perform at their expected metrics within weeks after your training. The best thing about is that their new minimum wage policy is now $15 an hour.
good,"Amazon Flex delivery driver is a stressful job. The warehouse is fast paced, and sometimes the warehouse employees are rude and unhelpful. I get to sort of be my own boss, but there is a lot of wear and tear on my vehicle. Gas is not reimbursed."
good,Work can be overwhelming if a steady pace isn't maintained. The warehouse environment is loud an the temperatures inside can get uncomfortably hot even at night.
good,"es ist toll das alle""Arbeiter"" job level 1"" egal ob M oder W das selbe verdienen!"
good,the people you meet are great its the tracking every second that your off your machine that annoys people beside that they may train you to drive forklifts if you want
good,"habia un ambiente de trabajo muy bueno ya que eramos mucho personal y habia mucho compañerismo ,"
good,"I only worked for a short while with Amazon but during my employment i was frequently overwhelmed with anxiety due to the hours and the lack of stimuli and personal iterations between coworkers. "
good,"This is a fantastic company to work for if you're a new employee. But they start trying to push you out the door at about you're 2 year mark. Also beware that unless you're hired in as a manager, the odds of you advancing are quite dismal. They require advancement to Process Assistant first, no matter your education level. After that, they only promote one process assistant per shift, per year to manager. This creates a very long transition to management where as you're better off looking elsewhere after your second year."
good,"Just not enough hours and they make it really hard to transfer to full time. For the most part it is laid back, but at times really fast paced to make sure that all of the packages go out on time."
good,"Pretty straight forward. Pay is great work isn't too hard , management sucks it's a good place to work I still currently work there just on here looking for a side job"
good,"My role is basically personal shopping in a grocery store.  It keeps me active and i can interact with the Team members in the store several times a week and make friends.  We have metrics, but if you stay on task it is easy once you learn the ropes."
good,"Management at MKC6 is the worst, lack of training in most departments unless you demand more, quick to give write-ups to associates who dont hit rate, but are hardly there to give coachings on bettering the associate. I've heard other buildings are better with these types of things, MKC6 is just not where it should be with caring for the employees. They do have amazing benefits and incredible pay, lots of prizes you can win just for going into work."
good,Management needs improvement!!!! Coworkers were amazing. I really enjoyed working there until new management came in and made working there unbearable.
good,"no work life balance .ate this company*required"
good,"I would still be working there if it was worth the 30 minute drive I had to make. The work was very simple although I didn't see much room for advancement. Also, every shift, most of the staff was released halfway through the shift."
good,I would never work here again. They never answered my call after maternity leave so that I could keep my job. I tried transferring to one that was closer to me and they wouldn’t transfer me at all. Even after I explained that I just had twins and they were in the hospital and I needed to be closer to them. Inconsiderate management!!!!!
good,"I am work in Amazon but no bonus  no benefits management all so Verry bad  so am waiting  for  new "
good,"As a merchandise stower, I would find bins in a prescribed area that could be used for merchandise to be stowed in.  The day started out with announcements, then stretching, then we were told where we'd be working, and set out for that area.  After lunch, we'd stretch again, and be notified about extra work hours if we wanted to work them, then set about stowing again.  Eventually, the overtime was mandatory so we worked a 50 hour work week until the end of the holidays.  RV space rent was provided near the fulfillment center we worked at, which was a perk in addition to having a temporary job.  The workplace culture was one of full time workers being patient with many temporary workers being there for 3 - 4 months.  It was hardest to continue work when we were so tired that we couldn't make dinner after work.  But I really enjoyed meeting and working with so many different other folks, both temporary and folks that have been there for many years."
good,"Some of the Senior Managers are not interested in developing employees new to product management. They have an attitude based on the fact that there is always a backlog of product manager candidates. So, the senior managers are very handoff and practically do not care to develop and coach you through challenges and confusions. When looking for internal roles, you are completely on your own without any helps from the company."
good,"If you can meet their standard then you’ll do fine at Amazon. It’s a pretty reliable and simple job for most associates. Most people are hired as seasonal, and have to wait it out, and do well before you can convert to permanent. It’s a good experience."
good,"Management is hired on the spot with no experience in management. Just as long as you have a college degree and that you haven't worked for Amazon prior to. To advance, you go thru more interviews for a Tier 3 position than if you're going to apply for area manager. The ""pros"" of working for amazon are awesome health benefits, vacation hours are unlimited, granted you get and hour 30 min. each pay period. They have this thing called ""UPT"" which they start you at 80 hours. Depending on you shift status. That's unpaid time off. Then they have PTO, paid time off. Which you are given a cap of 48 hours total. And, they have this Career Choice, which they allow you to go back to school. They pay 95% of the tuition."
good,I would recommend working at Amazon.com its a good place to work at. Amazon.com offers a great development programme and upgrades people with skills to move forward in the respective field.
good,"Amazon is a fast paced job. The warehouse is climate controlled and very large, it requires a lot of standing and walking also some RIC require you to be able to do heavy lifting."
good,Started part time. As a picker and stower. Then was offered a job in produce / deli Dept.. first Manager I had was awesome. Then a new manager came in and did nothing but be on computer and did nothing for production.
good,"Nothing bad nothing good,"
good,"Nice place to work. Just was a temporary position."
good,.working for Amazon is like working as a SLAVE so that is the reason I have left amazon and there is no career in Amazon and I’m looking for career progression
good,It's a good place to get some callcenter experience.
good,the job should be fulltime when you first start there because they start you off as part time which is not cool or understanding at all when there is employees being pushed away and want more hours instead of having to work other shifts which is too much I was told I was going to eventually going to become fulltime I have bills that are fulltime a part time job is not no where near okay unless you are married.
good,it was a very long day. Was on our feet for 10 to 12 hours a day. We only had a 30 min lunch. On the days where work was slow they sent you to other department to work.
good,Get there and stretch. get your routes and go the the bags where you would load them into the carts for what route the order would go. The drivers or you either load them and they get delivered.
good,This is a good company to work for if you are at the start or end of your career. Or it will just get you by till you find something better. The benefits are good but the pay and hours are not so impressive.
good,"Good pay, good overtime hours, stressful though, hard to keep up to expected goals. Good benefits, usually work 4 days off 3 unless mandatory overtime"
good,"Flexibility in shifts, good management, pays for overtime and performance bonus. Lot many training provided be it classroom training or online training"
good,"At the beginning when the building was just opening I had time to learn new things. But currently, work has been so constant with no time to learn new things."
good,"Typical work day was fast paced, Learned to deliver packages the correct way to customers, management was reasonable, workplace was good, hardest part was the labor of the job."
good,"Working with many people on the job, also it teaches you basic skills in a warehouse environment. You learn about the inner workings of the largest provider of goods."
good,"enjoyed fellow coworkers"
good,The job was fun but hard. I was able to meet people from different countries and different personalities. The most enjoyable part working for amazon you make new lifetime friends.
good,The company itself was great the only thing that was wishy washy was the management and the temp agency that did the hiring. A lot of the time the temp agency and management were not on the same page.  Chain of comand was off?!
good,The work/life balance is non-existent. Most people burn-out from the labor requirements or feeling unappreciated.  Good people work here. I find it difficult for many people to do well here.  Poor leadership and lack of proper training with outrageous expectations.
good,I worked at amazon on 2 different occasions and had different experiences on both. The first time i started during the temp season around Christmas and left in January. The second time I started around 2 months earlier ( September) and left at the end of January.
good,it was hard at first but I managed to get through it and worked well and all the time I was working there I had great relations with other co workers .
good,"In all it's a great company but not a good company for engineers though... A day usually starts with a ""survey"" in which you would be asked questions about your working environment. Engineers need to push code every day in general, and your life would be miserable if working with a bad manager,"
good,"Amazon is a fast pace environment, learned different jobs enjoyed picking and packing different items making sure customers get exactly what they ordered. Management is terrible (with the exception of a few) they don't like to speak their a bunch of young people out of college that don't know people skills."
good,"It was nice place to work and everything was fine but working under amazon within different payroll so it was kind of contract type, however i had enjoyed the elegance working at amazon at every day of life"
good,Working for Amazon is fast-paced and at times stressful. The workload is manageable if you keep on task. Advancement is difficult. Management is not always approachable.
good,"Be physically fit and ready to move fast for several hours.  Also, your hours within your shift can flex up or down, depending on the daily volume and customer demands. "
good,"n/a-nothing to  say, everyday is different, you have to work there to make a decision one way or the other about how you feel and what you can tolerate."
good,I enjoy working with the people that do their jobs and not wait  until someone else does it. It is a very physical job and you get a good work out.Sometimes the managers are not on the same page and that is  when people get angry and do whatever they want
good,I love my job just need security and stability on job more money too many taxes taken out job should start at 14hr fired way too easily at the job also
good,The pay is average as per industry standards but the work load increases disproportionately with little change in pay. The work culture is competitive and friendly at the same time.
good,"You will learn little things by joining TRMS. "
good,"Amazon was a good employer and I would work there again if they paid more. Their pay seems like a lot when you initially get an offer but then you remove taxes, parking costs, and medical benefit premiums, and what you are left with will not allow you to afford to live anywhere near work. On top of that, the largest tech company in the country doesn't allow remote working from home, placing an even bigger drain on your wallet and places unreasonable stress on work/life balance. "
good,"Wanted to work full time but in San Bernardino Ont 5, they would only allow part-timers. Also, I would work twice as hard as other people who would just go there to play around and still get paid the same...they should reward those who are actually there to work hard and get rid of the players."
good,"I was a start up at a new facility at Campbellsville when I first started at Amazon.. My ability to rise was fast.  I went from floor associate to Recevie Clerk to a Problem solver all with a the first few monthts of being with the company.    After that, the prgression was slower but I never thought it was because the company did not believe in me.   I actually got the chance to move around with the company from Campbellsville, to Louisville even out out to Coffeyville, Kansas while being able to provide stints of training at other facilities.  "
good,"as a temporary employment service company, they do put people to work and only if you want to work. peak season is the way to earn extra money for the holidays."
good,"Non c’e parità di trattamento tra lavoratori dipendenti e lavoratori interinali, anche se l’azienda asserisce il contrario. La pausa è solo di mezz’ora, ma si riduce a 20 minuti in considerazione degli spostamenti per raggiungere gli spogliatoi e le aree ristoro ed in quanto ci si deve presentare cinque minuti prima della ripresa del lavoro per il briefing; il lato positivo è che è pagata. I ritmi di lavoro sono sostenuti ed i targhet richiesti sono alti. Nei periodi di picco l’azienda organizza eventi alcuni dei quali riservati solo ed esclusivamente ai dipendenti diretti Amazon tipo concorsi fotografici a premi, estrazione premi, e concorsi vari. I dipendenti diretti godono anche di numerosi benefit, solo alcuni di essi sono accessibili anche ai lavoratori interinali. I ruoli all’interno del magazzino sono tanti e di solito si impara a svolgere diverse di questa, per poter intervenire in caso di bisogno, gli interinali possono ricoprire solo il ruolo di operaio, tutti gli altri ruoli sono riservati ai dipendenti diretti"
good,management for the most part had no clue on half of the rules and procedures of the roles they were assigned to manage.
good,"This job was good, I met a lot of friends from here. The management were all about productivity and didn't care if they lost a staff member. If your staff are happy business will boom."
good,Great hard old labor but I loved it!!!! Fasted paced hot was fun. And made my day go fast!!! Was one of the fun jobs I have had in along time. Mang A+
good,"Coworkers were all friendly, and helpful. However, my experience was there was not enough training. I believe the training could be improved. Just hoping by now it has improved."
good,"you don't have a set hours...."
good,"Amazon Retail is being automated, know what you are getting into otherwise you may end up looking for a job sooner than you think. Cut-throat job advancement with limited opportunities to grow up. Lots of opportunity to make lateral moves (same pay, different responsibilities). Great culture, if you have a good category  manager."
good,it is what it is. Has pros and cons i my self like working there others just do what they got to do. kind of liberal in the way they do things. i can be employed there and never step foot in the building for months.
good,"i stowed items in bins at a fast paced manner, couldnt make a lot of mistakes or you would get fired. Impossible to take bathroom breaks when not on a break, or else you scanner would count that your gone and not doing your job and get fired."
good,"Best warehouse job I ever had easy but fast pace friendly people. Pay could be bette, and they could  do a better job at training new employees ........."
good,"Even if one does a superior job, there is no positive feedback given."
good,"We stretch and get ready for the workload ahead. We work quickly and efficiently to get the products out and loaded to be sent to our customers as quickly as possible. Depending on which half of the week it is the flow is concise and orderly or dysfunctional and confusing. The other amazonians are great to work along side everyone doing their part to get the job done. The best part of the shift is at the end when you have a full sense of accomplishment at all the packages that will be received on time. The hardest part is at the very beginning when you look at the floor and realize all of those packages need to be out on time and you have to help get it their, sometimes the task can seem overwhelming but exhilarating once it is completed."
good,You have to be quick at times of either loading packages on the belt or to either unloading the trucks to get them in and out quick. Also to even scanning packages so that way the customer gets a notification showing their package arrived at the facility
good,I personally loved my job until i got written up for my errors i had made while they moved to another department to help them because they were short staffed. I also feel managers pick and choose their favorites and treatment is not equal when it comes to write ups.
good,"Although I only worked here for a short time, I really liked the environment and the job itself. sadly it was only a temporary position and was not able to progress."
good,This job is very fast paced and consistently changing. They have great benefits but some very poor management. A typical day at work consist of making a steady rate and keeping up with the work load.
good,Integrity Staffing is a good place to work and during peek season you will make tons of money.  They do give you lots of hours but you must keep up it is a very fast pace company and you are allowed to miss days but it is not recommended it will count against you later if you intend to convert over to Amazon.
good,Simple job to get to grasps with easily and will pick up how everything functions easy enough when you listen and apply yourself properly. The management are helpful and are always on hand to give you any guidance if needed.
good,"Great people to work with, we seemed to bond with our struggles and accomplishments. I was able to move up quickly in the company, but only to a point where it then plateaued. Hard work DOES pay off... IF you can keep up. Amazing workplace culture, benefits, stocks, 401k. Not as many paid OR EVEN UNPAID hours allowed off compared to hours we DO work. You are expected to work your butt off or get the heck out! Basically. But the team leaders and supervisors are great at motivating us and keeping us going and achieving our goals and feeling like our work is actually fulfilling."
good,"Very fast paced environment, management treat you like a number rather than an individual. Everyone is very friendly to say the least! most other operatives are very down to earth and mostly criticize their jobs"
good,"Amazon is a fast paced customer focused organization that leans heavily on employee flexibility and shared labor among departments.  All functions are rate based making workdays stressful at times.  Pay is at the lower end of typical warehouse jobs, but the benefits are very good."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Amazon as a Sortation Associate. The work is very fast paced and you get a workout in every single day. The only thing i would change at this job would be the rate of pay. I was pretty disappointed that other Amazon sites such as Cincinnati and Newark made $19.00 and $17.00 per hour, whereas Pittsburgh does more volume and services more cities and we only make $11.25 per hour, down from $12.25 per hour last year. Otherwise, it's a great job"
good,"I love working at Amazon for the time i was there (3 months) but seeing how many hours it drains out of you is hard when you have a family. I would like to also say that this could have been due to peak season but aside from that, the company is great!"
good,Have comfortable shoes. Gob security doesn’t exist what ever you wont do a company like amazon will find someone else. Overall not a bad experience. But mixing college full time with Amazon full time just wasn’t for me
good,"Changes in process are not communicated until it becomes an issue for you. The process is constantly changing in an attempt to ""make things better"" but little if any changes include feed back from those performing the task."
good,"When I first started this job was terrific pay and very easy to get hours to work."
good,"Amazon fulfillment associates can expect a fast paced, high stressed work environment. Compensation and benefits are great, but the work metrics, expectations, and standards are high to match. Managers are usually hired from outside, causing a constant learning curve with frequent changes in management."
good,They have to many unnessary rules. Hard to move up from a position. They not very caring about other people needs. To meet they standard is very hard. You will literally have to stay focus and have very little mess up. It's very easy to get the job and very easy to lose the job as well
good,"It's not a bad company to work for, but the management is what makes it difficult. A lot of unprofessionalism and personal feelings came into play. If the management was better I would probably still be there."
good,"I applied as a full time employee after I was hired I was told I would be a temp. So they are really misleading in that aspect. Most of the people that had gotten hired were under the same impression that we were full time employees. Other than that, the managers and warehouse employees were great. The hrs were long but not too tiring considering it was Black Friday time."
good,"My job was only to stock shelves, so there was not much else to do."
good,company is good  but the thing is 10 hours standing duty. because of this work legs pain badly. environment is very good. every person support over der.
good,"Being an associate is quite physical, being on your feet and working in the fast pace environment takes a toll on your body so should preferably be a short-term job. "
good,I got on with Amazon after I was terminated from my previous employer. This was a quick hire but took two weeks to walk in the door. The people there are nice to be around. Management is slim to none. The HR department doesn't talk to Management and the whole place is on a who you know basis. If you have a degree you are a manager. If you work your butt off. You need to work harder. I have done plenty of jobs that call for a above and beyond in all the elements. This one is up there with the hardest.
good,I loved my managers. The OPa not so much. I was good and so I was often traded to other departments to help them out. The biggest issue is that disciplinary actions are not equal across the board.
good,"If you're looking for a temporary position with a possibility of becoming permanent, this is a great company to work with. They do have time off available but it is not paid if you're temporary."
good,The shift hours need to be adjusted so people won't have to spend so much time away from their love ones. The company goals would go up daily and causing the employee to work 10 times harder to make up for the employees who did not work as fast.
good,"I had a lot of fun learning their processes. I learned how to launch a operating system,  and I learned how to drive a fork lift,  and I was on their safety committee."
good,"I feel I lost the Boss lottery since it was a new FC (fulfillment center) there were all-new fresh out of training managers who were bright eyed and bushy tailed. They however lacked sense, for the most part. Don't get me wrong, A good percentage of them were fantastic, great people and great at their job. I was very unlucky in the sense that my specific bosses had no idea what they were doing and violated regulations constantly."
good,"I enjoy the job, reasonable targets are given, team leaders and managers are fair. Full of rude and ignorant foreign employers which spoils the job for me. They are a bunch of animals"
good,Very competitive pay compared to similar jobs.  Opportunities to get trained on various equipment.  Certain managers have no idea to speak to associates which creates a tense environment.
good,A typical day at Amazon is up and down. The environment is great however do to the continuous changes and the management not talking to one other; things do get confusing and difficult.
good,"I was in the recieve department so its very fast paced, that was my favorite part. You're constantly busy so the day goes by nice and quick. Unfortunately I was a temp so I didnt have benifits."
good,Amazon needs to stop bringing in college graduates to run their facilities. Overall the best thing I can say about Amazon is the benefits.  :::::::::::
good,This place stresses you out but I isnt as bad as it could be. Some of the management  are nice while others are not. You never know when you will only work 3 hours or 4 hours or even 5 hours. There is no real set schedule besides when you have to be there. All in all when you start there it is a fun place and the 10% discount on amazon is nice. But after a while it starts to where you down.
good,Ok place to work. There are time and rate requirements that have to be met. If you don't mind supervisors looking over your shoulder ever so often. To their credit they were never rude about it just kind of condescending.
good,"I enjoyed working there!  There were many opportunities for additional hours, however the days and shifts they promised me when I was first hires were not the ones that they gave me,"
good,"i was at amazon for 2 years i loved it at the begining but i dont like it anymore it is a workplace culture and casual dress , but the managers were not doing there job well"
good,got a job its a job. nothing special. very employable company. they hire anyone.benefits are good always at work. constant change in management and operation.
good,Nice place to work except my hrs. Great learning experience for younger people. Hard work sometimes but not all the time. Friendly managers​ some people are nice to work with.
good,I have previously worked here before and it has definitely become a lot harder to work there with higher targets and unfair management in practice. Certain supervisors showed favors towards other colleagues. Also all targets have become too high to cope with and break time minutes allowance are even more strict. It is almost not worth working there anymore in future now that its becoming harder and harder.
good,"I enjoyed most of my years at Amazon. I met a lot of different people with many different values on life and work, but these people eventually became  family. Some days was harder than others, especially if you were an individual with children most of us leave home at 5am and didn't return until 6:30-7pm. It was pretty much hard labor so you were tired when you reached home, no doubt about it. We went through a lot of managers some better than others but overall we knew what was expected of us. We were very productive, but didn't feel so much as being valued. Which I feel like a company should always do value those who make things better for your company without them it couldn't be possible. This job made me realize that going back to school was my best option. I want not only be challenged but show what I have learned through my many positions. I want to grow with a company."
good,"My hours were 5:30PM to 4:30AM, SUNDAY through Thursday.  The difficulty was not seeing my kids.  Finding quality night care them that was affordable and safe.  "
good,While I really loved working here there is much that needs to change with this company. their devotion to customers is great but they need to improve the reality of there workers. Standing on a concrete floor for 11+ hours a day is hard and they do not provide any real jobs for people with work restrictions or disabilities.
good,"Better than minimum wage, zero consideration towards work/balance, excellent benefits package, good chances of career progression although not based on merits of employee."
good,Each day is long and boring with very little interaction with other people as it is not good for business. Also as a temp is not a lot of job security even if you are smashing your tagets.
good,good benefits but overall long hours and repetition and hard on body. Dont really look out for employees overall.. High turnaround. Management not fair.
good,its great pay but you will sacrafice your social life th breaks at to short for 10 hours shifts no need to let the pack employees sit  from time to time
good,Enjoyed work and lack of supervision. Enabled a lot of professional and personal growth within the role and company. Work life balance is good and the people on my team are wonderful.
good,"Working with amazan was nice. I do not have problem."
good,"untrained, unprofessional (children in background constantly), very hard to contact when i needed help. Her answer was always ""I'm not sure""....not honest with seasonal end date, led us on."
good,"highly stressful atmosphere. continuously on the go, but the compensation does not evenly compare to the amount of work and responsibility"
good,"This was a good paying job, and I had the opportunity to lead great teams! I think it takes a certain type of person to thrive in this company; and the ability to be patient in the world's most customer centric company."
good,"amazon is a friendly place to work, the work ethic is hard with lots of targets to hit to be able to stay in the role for any legth of time, but if you are willing to work hard it can be beneficial."
good,I worked with a team of 18 guys. I worked in the middle west area. We traveled a lot. Worked on the railroad fixing the track and cleaning it as well.
good,"Lovely bunch of people from all different backgrounds. The company put you through your licences for example FLT PUP Reach and LLOP, unfortunately they are all in-house licensed."
good,"Treat the staff like rubbish , would never recommend any one work there if your disable or disabilities ,. Won't let you take more than a week holiday"
good,just wish had a branch in Bolton and was close to home and it was permanent like there shift 4 on 3 days of good atmosphere and a friendly environment.
good,"lots and lots of pressure from upper management to meet ""unnecessary"" quotas"
good,overall decent company to work at its clean and safe. amazon also has a repayment program for those who want to further their education earning a paycheck.
good,"Conducted training of associates to have safe operation and licensure of power industrial trucks."
good,"Working at Amazon for almost two years or so it is a very fast pace and fun job to work with at first if your coming in as a temp or as a full time worker, the benefits they give you as an associate are fair, good co-workers comes with any department you go in and the most enjoyable part about the job is getting it done and moving on to the next job. The hardest part about the job is that is communicating through HR for personal reasons, it is short shift and for question you would have to go up to the building or wait an extended amount of time just for them to get back at you."
good,fast pace workplace with the satisfaction of fulfilling a costumers order. in this company there is always room to participate in different fun and uplifting activities.
good,"Although the company says they care about employees, I personally don't feel like they do. I get along with my coworkers but over all I would prefer to work somewhere else. It's a good its just not the job for everyone. On the plus side you do receive benefits, whether you/re part time or full time."
good,"I worked as a stower for Amazon, and overall I had a relatively good experience as an employee. I liked the schedule of four ten hour days with overtime during the holidays, it left more time during the week for other things without sacrificing hours. My job stowing inventory was simple, and after a while became almost mind numbingly dull. But it was worth it for the steady and mostly decent paycheck. There is really very little chance for advancement from the bottom up unless you have a degree, you can really only move sideways. It was extremely saddening when my employment was terminated do to an alleged violation of their attendance policy (I took a voluntary time off day when offered, wasn't entered into the system, and was written off a no-call-no-show). Despite that, I would gladly work for them again (but maybe as a picker instead)."
good,"Sometimes exhausting and yet sometimes fun to work, being switched between processes makes this job less monotonic."
good,"Distribution Center, Dematic conveyors, shoe sorters, label printers, 3M tapers, Wexxar box  machines, scales, RA conveyance, Hydrol, Power Flex, reactive calls, repairs and projects.  Many machines to work on regularly at fast pace, nothing can stay down - Hold you to very high standards, if for any reason you can't do the job they cut you lose."
good,"Work is easy, but during Peak you live, breath, eat, sleep, AMAZON. Great benefits, great company, but physically demanding."
good,"Usually, stayed busy with sometimes not enough work, however, it was a great place for promotion. People were pretty much friendly for the most part, but management did whatever they wanted to most of the time."
good,Co-workers are exceptional in some regards. I enjoyed being trained as a Process Assistant. A typical day I work Problem Solve and trouble shoot bins and items.
good,"Its a very demanding job, you work 10 hour shifts and depending on your position you walk the whole shift. Its not a job I recommend to someone who doesn't have strong work ethics."
good,I was overall happy with the day as it rolls along but the lack of breaks and amount of security clearance checkpoints diminished my time.
good,A typical day at work would be very fast paced and busy especially during holiday seasons. I worked extremely well with management and co workers. Overall it was a great company to work for and glad I had the opportunity to work there.
good,"management needs to pay attention all the workers equally."
good,"Starts well and HR friendly, Does not last for long when your probation has finished"
good,"typical day consisted of 12 hour shifts,the more i worked the more i learned about my job,the management was always very helpful when a problem came up to solve,the co-workers were nice and friendly,the hardest part of the job was being very fast paced,the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new friends"
good,My job at amazon was seasonal but within a short time I learned different positions. A typical day was long and you constantly had to move at a fast pace. Management made sure you were meeting quota with how many boxes you sent out and if the quality was perfect. Most co workers were helpful and friendly I made many friends their. The hardest part was keeping a steady high pace and standing for long periods of time. Enjoyable part was meeting a wide variety of people from all around the world. Also the pay was highly decent. Overall the job was worth it and wish I could have made it permanent.
good,"Fun job! Shopping for Amazon customers in local stores. Easy, flexible hours.  Part time only. No benefits. Management is ok. High turnover. New people often."
good,The hardest part was working in extreme conditions such as the heat and the walking and not being compensated for it and feeling unappreciative . They have great benefits but they include that in the compensation package so they try and make u think that u are actually making more an hour
good,"You are expected to work a ten hour shift four days a week. The breaks are extremely short with barely enough time to go to the toilet by the time you have got from your work station to the canteens. You are worked like a donkey all day and cannot stop, or your productivity score will go right down resulting in job loss."
good,Enjoyable workplace large warehouse very busy environment.Pay should have been higher for work performed.Major drawback was the numerous delays with the robotic delivery of customer merchandise.
good,Overall a good place to work. The job is very time consuming but its all worth it. Would love to work there again. All about numbers. could have more staff for sick and hurt people.
good,Competitive work environment that present a challenging work life balance environment. There is definitely a steep learning curve when joining the company.
good,"Answering phone calls and emails for customers who need help with their orders. I learned very good customer relation skills, however, we were severely judged by customers' reactions to how we helped them, making the work environment quite stressful at times.  The company is very generous to their employees as far as celebrating holidays and company goals."
good,"The lack ok communication between production and shifts makes it hard to be successful for the common associate. "
good,"love the company. co workers very nice friendly welcoming"
good,"Es gab nie einen typischen Tag bei Amazon, denn es gab jeden Tag etwas neues. Egal ob es eine Überraschnung war, wir sahen es als Herausforderung noch mehr zu wachsen und mit dem Kunden mit zu lernen. Ich habe viel gelernt, nicht nur im Frontoffice, sondern auch im Backoffice, da ich das Glück hatte, durch Sonderaufgaben mit dem Management zusammen zu arbeiten. Durch meine Position habe ich es schätzen gelernt, wie sehr sich doch das Management bemüht zu helfen und auf alles Antworten zu kennen, auch wenn sie manchmal etwas mehr Zeit in Anspruch nahmen. Mein Team war das erste Team seiner Art und es war schön, es reifen zu sehen und Teamarbeit war das Größte für uns."
good,"Shifts are long, the amount of walking is tears your body down. Management doesn't communicate with you unless its negative feedback. Most co-workers agree that the managers aren't organized and most of them aren't friendly. The job it self isn't hard the people you work under make the job difficult. The pay is good and the benefits are as well."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"go to designated station ...making sure station is stocked with boxes, etc needed for the day...verify items on computer and box size....prepare box...place items in box, pack, pkg receipt in box, tape box and send down line.....good management to work for....wonderful co-workers to work with....the hardest part of the job is depending on the line...you may have heavy items and have to prepare large boxes which can be difficult to maneuver...I loved being able to complete my job and make my numbers."
good,not a bad place to work. a very busy place with something going on all the time. No time to play around for anyone. On changing shifts had to check with out going guards to see what had been happening and any new business that might effect me. Majority of time things went pretty smooth.
good,"Amazon was a great place to work. They had many incentives for you to continue working. The work is hard and there is a lot of walking however, the incentives make it worth it."
good,"I was enrolled into two courses:"
good,This job paid the bills and then some but it wasn't something that I would want to do forever. The staff isn't very friendly and they act more like drill sergeants.
good,"learnt a lot about e-commerce."
good,"Alot of work everyday. Little assistance from peers. Co-workers are good. There are not much get -together team session. Life revolves around work. Employee benefits are minimal as frugality is one of the leadership principals at Amazon."
good,"Team meeting at start of shift look to see which task you were assigned to or if you was to be trained on something else I was trained to receive goods onto the system initially, I was then trained to cubiscan items this was to measure and weigh items to ensure the correct box was used or if one had to be specially made for it, and whether it was safe for one person to lift or not."
good,Amazon Inc. is a great place to work. Each day there is something new to learn and implement in your everyday work routine. It's the most customer centric company in the world.
good,"This job was not hard at all. I enjoyed the work that needed to be done, along with the employees that i worked with; however, the management of the building could have needed some work. They didn't stay focused on keeping everyone working on an even pace. Those that did work had to pick up the slack of those that really didn't want to be there. Third shift wasn't a bad haul to make money, but i didn't get to be with my family as much as i would like too. I did learn to work as a team with others in my department. Working with others helps the night go by quicker."
good,"Very fast paced work, i worked their during the peak period and was doing 60 hour weeks. The other workers are as friendly as they can be in that kind of job. Not the easiest of jobs to jump into but you do receive help when needed."
good,"I have learned a lot about warehouse work here.  Being able to bounce around and learn whatever job that needs to be done is very enjoyable.  Many people that work there so it made breaks very crowded and hard to find a place to sit.  The management is very important, they pump us up every night before we start our shift.  The most enjoyable part is when we set records for most items processed."
good,"I was employed via an agency, who were pretty much useless if you had any issues, they didn't want to know. They are paid by Amazon and will never go against them. Amazon constantly broke the law and the agencies went along with them. I loved working for Amazon, but was treated so badly by the agency. All agencies at Amazon are the same, they have no interest in your concerns or well being, all they are interested in is the money that Amazon pay them, they couldn't care less about their own employees."
good,"demanded hard work, fast paced environment. attention to detail health and safety and accuracy. while working at amazon i found a good sense of achievement on a daily bases with all tasks target driven you can review your targets and feel your achievement when you have beaten your expected target."
good,The long hours i didnt really care for. But the overall experince was good you catch on really quickly and its a great workout.
good,To be completely honest. This is a VERY physically demanding and time consuming job. It leaves very little personal time for anybody with 20 minute commute or more.
good,"um dia de trabalho desafiador."
good,"Working at Amazon fulfilment centre was a great experience and truly changing. My job role consist of me picking the correct items from the correct shelves and putting them onto a trolley, which would then be delivered to the packing department. Due to the warehouse being so big, attention to detail was essential alongside time keeping and I had to make sure that I was picking the right item out of the correct shelf and make sure that I have picked all the correct items within the time specified otherwise it would, not only slow down production but it would also cause more problems in other departments."
good,"Great warehouse experience."
good,I worked full-time at Amazon for 1 month at the Christmas period. I worked nightshift. 10pm til 7am.  I picked all the products that the customers have ordered then I proceeded to take them to the shipping area where the products are then taken to the customers.  I also packed the products and cleaned the warehouse occasionally.  the most enjoyable part of the job was working with my friends and meeting new people.
good,very productive labor intensive early mornings and short nights
good,productive and fun workplace with large break rooms the job was very production aware and gave u goals to reach day to day
good,"I would pick products for 2 hours, then go pack product. Management would move people around and people would have no idea what was going on most of the time. Once I established myself in learning more I found that their was a lot of un-communicated information that would help associates learn their job duties. Co workers had negative attitudes due to this issue. For me the hardest part of the job was trying to figure out what needed to be done prior to trucks arriving with no help for supervisors. I enjoyed working the mech-lift area, because I was able to work at a fast paced with one other individual to pick large items, and produce the shipping label and load the trucks with these items."
good,Most days I have to move inventory to a fixed location so that the pickers are able to pick inventory. The most important lesson that I have learned form Amazon is working with a diverse team. Most management at Amazon is managers stratight out of college with no real work experience this can be a challenge and can also be one of the biggest obstacles of this company. The most enjoyable part of my job is handling all the unique inventory and the challenges that aspect offers. 
good,it is a good company it is hard to get into perm. but it is good money for the holidays. it was difficult for me being pregnant but I will be back next Christmas for shopping money. they are strict on safety because they care about their associates and I like that most places don't care.
good,"you get out what you put in, if you dont keep up with rate youll get the boot. then again i was seasonal"
good,"Everyday we would have a meeting about our goal for the day and what our quota would be. Then we would always do stretches before working. Then everyone would find out what area in the building we would be working. It was a very fast paced and stressful at times. But almost everyone there would try to make it fun, but the hardest thing was standing on concrete made your feet hurt everyday! The management was pretty good, sometimes frustrating because they were always changing the process of how to run the dock."
good,"It was physically demanding job; we were all(co-workers) on our feet for 10-hour shifts with 2 15-min breaks (for relief and water) and 1 30-min break(for lunch). I learned how to do packaging slips for boxes, the shipping sticker, scanning the boxes into the database, packing the boxes and taping them up. The worse problem for me was that they told me I could come in extra days and then fire me the week before. No matter what they never tell you when they gonna start letting people go(they send you in circles on who to ask about it and you never seem to produce any answers)."
good,"Training new and old employees, handling food and customer serivce is a typical work day. Learned about food saftey and prep. management was a weak point of job. Very much enjoyed freinds made there. Nothing about the job was very hard at all. work enviroment was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Hard work..great people...good pay...standing, bending,"
good,"A typical day started with information sharing from a process supervisor ( safety reminders, problem areas, etc.).   The shifts were usually busy.  Management and co workers were friendly and culture is relaxed.  I learned attention to detail in a fast paced environment."
good,Pretty simple job just physical. This job is decent its physically tiring but that is expected its a warehouse.The pay is as told online. Management is management they are helpful when needed.
good,"Come in and work 10, 11, or 12 hour shifts depending on the season during the year. Since Amazon is a highly used company they are always busy and fast paced. Its pretty strenuous on the body giving you pick up from anywhere from a 1/2 pound to about 40-50 pound objects."
good,Très bonne entreprises mais mal organisée. Pas de vie personnelle a cotée du a la charge de travail.
good,"Fast paced environment delivering packages, up to 50 pounds, to customers safely and efficiently in a delivery van. 4, 10 hour days with 30 minutes for lunch and 2,15 minute breaks"
good,"Tend to mistreat their employees. Company indicated that breaks would be 15 min, but would turn out to be 3. Parking was terrible. Management would use vile language to employees."
good,"The job is very nice, but it is extremely face paced in terms of changes, things change every day, due to the fact that amazon hasn’t been on the delivery side very long  but I do believe the company will stabilize and be a great place to work eventually"
good,"chess board is provided, TT , and pool is also there , team outings are once in 3 months , company budjet is 500 rupees per hear , leadership is below power in taking decessions on staffing ."
good,"It's an adventure.  Like SEAL training or the Army Rangers - you'll be pushed to your limits and you'll grow.  But the majority of people either drop out or get performance ratings that push them out.  "
good,Muchos filtros para una semana que te contratan no es muy recomendable
good,The pay raise was great however if you state once an employee is there for a amount of time that they will be hired full time then do that. Don’t just string employees along due to you needing their work skills
good,Mi sono  trovato  bene  e nonostante  step rigidi   sono  riuscito a  ritagliarmi  assieme  ad  altre persone   lavori  Non  troppo  ripetitivi  e sono riusciendo ad accedere a e  mansioni    con  il  loro  p.c  stampe   varie  ed invii  Giffwrap .
good,"Highest paying job I had pays more all collision repair shops, I went to college for collision repair."
good,here at amazon it is a good place to work but can be very quite for work over quite times. perks of the job is they get you a van but you will have to pay £200 a week for that.
good,"Management discuss warehouse issues including safety for everybody in a daily basis. clean work environment and well organized.a good place to work seeking for part time job,request flexible work hours that works for your schedule"
good,"Professional and time management is key to succeed. Overall, is an amazing company always on innovation spree in market industry, particularly e- commerce."
good,"not a bad place to work, if you're willing to work hard.I worked at the fulfillment center, and I never did warehouse work before, so it wasn't my cup of tea. I wouldn't discourage any one else."
good,"The managers and team leaders are quite demanding, everything has to be on time for customers. They should look more for the workers because it becomes quite stressful."
good,"It's a job expect no benifits and to 9nly collect a paycheck. "
good,fun and fast pace but little  and odd hours  good managers horrible team leaders no assigned post always unsure were you would work at.not very good job security
good,It is alright.  Fast paced environment.  Management works hard and is fair.hardest part about the job is having to follow amazons constraints.  As a 3P it is difficult
good,"It's just as likely that you'll work on an inclusive, supportive & encouraging team with good leadership as you're to being on the exact opposite team"
good,you are basically just a meat sack waiting to get replaced my a robot as soon as bezos can figure it out. Thats really it... its not terrible but don't expect them to roll out the red carpet either
good,"Good for someone who needs extra cash in the future, as work/life balance is not a benefit one gets working in amazon. Good for meeting new people. Not many challanges as you only get two-three trainings for the first few years."
good,"Not a bad company as long as you understand you are just an employee to them. If you meet production and show up then you will keep your job."
good,Your entire body will be in pain after your shift. make sure your posture is good so your back doesn't hurt. You can't take any electronics inside while working and the factory is huge.
good,The job is ok. long work hours. bad management. disliked that I worked day shift but had to complete our shift work and finish night shifts but night shift was offered VTO. they shouldn't be offered Vto if they don't complete their rate and we were offered no veto.
good,I was not very much sufficient with my salary requirements. As being from a normal middle class family i used to be from not a good family background. So to take my family forward and to live a good and respectful life i have to earn.
good,Overall the company is very good to work for. You just have to find the building and job that fits you. I have learned so much throughout the years operationally and have also met so many good people that have helped me grow in so many ways.
good,I think I’m the overall perspective it’s not a bad company to work for these days. The management is horrible and they use the staff like cattle telling lies and being sneaky so they can get raises. Outside of that you lose weight sweating so much and the place is really what you make it honestly as long as you do your job and go home it’s the perfect place
good,Not a place for nightly drinkers. Long hours not super stressful unless you work for CAP or Packing. I had a being on-time issue due to drinking and staying up late. But overall good place to work.
good,Amazon was a good job I would go back if the hire me as a driver I like the hours an the work keep u on ya toes the hardest part was getting all the boxes packed up an route in time
good,"Basically, it is a work-from-home job, where they provide you enough devices to support your work, and also bare the Internet Charges. But, if you think about it as a job, it is not that good, no matter how good it may sound. You'll have a great time working there, only if you have got a good Team Manager by chance. And, I was lucky."
good,"A positive, collaborative organizational culture. Diversity of work. A sense of accomplishment upon completing tasks/assignments. A flexible schedule. Supportive and constructive feedback from managers and co-workers which help to grow professionally. Establish the quality of customer satisfaction to meet client’s expectations. Willingness to let employees pitch ideas and have an active leadership role in new initiatives. A promising growth."
good,"Engineering - Great team to support. Engineers report huge challenge transferring internally however, from a comp/advancement perspective. "
good,Fast Passed. Management could be better. I would recommend as part time.  The company could be more involved with employees at least at the warehouse I am located.
good,"it was a general warehouse duties."
good,"Dopo una nottata dura circa vorrebbe una pausa in più oltre alla mezz'ora a disposizione. Aggiungere una dopo le preparazioni rotte. Del resto tranne lo stipendio sotto pagato, niente da dire un lavoro stimolante"
good,It was a great experience working at amazon. However I did not like being temporary to the company. It was very hard to stay focus not know if Im going to continue working there because of the strict rules
good,Amazon is a great company to work for.However you primarily work shifts as you have to keep up with the US client base Which subsequently mean your home/social life will be non existent
good,"You definitely get hours and plenty of time for overtime. You’re kind of overworked and will feel too exhausted to do much outside of work. Time off is offered as vacation days, sick days, and unpaid time off. You accrue unpaid time off quarterly and vacation and sick days are accrued by the hours you work. There is a lot of favoritism with most managers so if you want to move up, suck up. Otherwise you may find a manager that actually cares about your performance."
good,"Problem solver, Packer, Picker, Stow, I.C.Q.A.       Oct. 2014 – 2018"
good,Warehouse was always shorthanded... This made it more difficult being that we had to load our own vans. The racks with your packages for your route weren't always in the correct spot or sometimes your route may haven't been pick.. this just always put you behind schedule even though it's a at your pace job
good,"Working at Amazon was cool at first, then things changed during the holidays. Work got more tiring. The management became less understanding and the work environment was no longer welcoming. From Amazon I learned basic warehousing skills and learned how to be more open with unfamiliar faces."
good,"Not enough hours to live on. Not enough work for to many workers. Unfortunately, good workers will leave seaking a better pay check. To much VTO (Voluntary Time Off because there isn't enough work)."
good,"Customer focused company. Employees feel more like numbers. They do provide excellent training. If you want to grow into a supervisory roll you must fit there cookie cutter, bubbly outgoing personality."
good,"There's a lot of money to be made and a lot of positions will let you trade your mental health and family/personal time for extra hours. This won't necessarily result in upwards movement as there is a big political component to being able to promote within. You are usually far better off amicably leaving Amazon for a year or so, and then applying for a higher level position in a different area of Amazon. Locations where the leadership principles culture is strong can be nice to work in as it tends to dampen the internal politicking effects, which is much stronger at sites that are not steeped in Amazon culture."
good,This is a job for those that are fast paced and are not easily distracted. You are expected to work at a certain pace and if you don't then there will be consequences unfortunately.
good,Benefits are fantastic and PTO VACATION AND UPT are typical but your only as good as your last day and unless you are a manager favorite you're expendable. 365 days at 100% to 150% and then 1 day 99.5% will get you a write up.
good,"That was what I wanted, so I had to compromise on the pay."
good,I didn't like working at the site I was at. I have nothing more to say about working at that particular site. It was very stressful working there and that sums it up.
good,"great co workers, fast paced work, lack of opportunity for growth, limited time, various positions available, great nursing station, great if offered for long term, not seasonal positions"
good,It is good to work at that company. We began at work early morning 7:3o and we had meeting what we can doing in that day. We began packing and we finish 18:00.
good,They did not treat employees fairly. They had alot of down days where we would lose money. I found a better job at whirlpool. I don't know if i would go back full time. I will part time though.
good,Please do not work here.  As it will be a life sucker. Do not work here because it is all bad here.  They overwork you here so much and I won't go back.
good,"..........Ok place to work.Promises of hiring for permanent then postpones often.Training is minimal.Little room ....................."
good,I had a lot of fun doing this job. Wish it would have been extended. They were always willing to work with you if you had things to take care of. If you like fast paced work then this is for you. I loved it because it allowed me to be there for my kids.
good,"Bonne expérience, renouvellé une seconde fois, bon tremplin"
good,Amazon has tons of projects to explore. But oncall and work life balance is very hectic and the compensation they offer for such a hectic work life should be much better than what they offer right now.
good,It was really ok environment was a nice as well to work. I enjoyed working alone with picking items for Amazon to mail out. The hours I work was great.
good,I enjoyed it the job in the beginning until the load became a little more than I can bare. The heat in the summer was a little to much. And the over load of work that we received was a lot
good,"On a typical work day I come in and check in with the upper management team to see what I will be doing, sometimes I am training new associates or working in particular areas with associates who need help. It's nice to have a routine where I am able to teach others as well as have the opportunity for growth myself."
good,I was a seasonal associate. Good job for college kids who don’t have bills to pay or people who don’t mind doing menial tasks. Good pay but very boring. I worked every day except Sunday doing 4 hour shifts which was pretty annoying but at least the shifts didn’t drag on.
good,Great please to work if you don't mind that feeling of being in High School again.  The social/political side of everything and everyone there is what kills the energy levels while trying to do your job. Constantly distracted by everyone's social problems there.
good,"A lot of work hours available. No opportunities for advancement. Very strict policies. Felt like i didnt know anyone, never even met my areas manager."
good,The great company not good for job security. great pay for motivated workers. you must maintain a great and safe work environment. also you must fulfill orders in a timely matter. you can not be off-task must say focused.
good,"overall, it is a great company with the most creative team mate and unique culture -- 14 leadership principle and two-way door way of thinking etc. ""work hard, have fun and make history!"". At the same time, not all the senior leadership thinks the same, espcially in unique china case."
good,Amazon can provide stability and can be a cool place to work; you will come into contact with some good people in life. Management and knowing how to talk to employees needs great improvement as well as earning paid time off needs improvement.
good,"Good money right out of high school, not much room to advance, easy to get fired. Very independent work environment, easy work if you stay on task and work smart."
good,The job was very fun and work hours was great..... I just didn't like the pay cut after being paid great at first.  The boss was great also my co workers were fun and supporting
good,Only issue was not being able to have the opportunity to work for the company was always thur the temp service so your job wasn't always secure you could be let go at any time and they follow a strict point system.
good,"This job operates on a point system and regardless to what your situation is you still accumulate points.  On two occasions I had to visit the ER and each time I receive points for those days, a total of 4.5 points. We were told if we had extenuating  circumstances these points could be removed. Unfortunate that did not happen even though I sent copies of my discharge papers and the return to work letter toHR."
good,Some jobs are extremely strenuous and yet the pay is the same as the jobs that aren’t. Benefits are amazing and start immediately so anyone that needs health insurance should apply. Managers tend to be lazy and will ask for a busy/sweating person to do even more instead of doing it themselves.
good,"It is a fast-paced environment but management has a high turnover rate and they always care more about productivity than safety or fun, in contrast to what they say. Numbers in the end is all they care about and this pushes some people too far."
good,"Great crew to work with, management need alot of improvement.need to improved on some safety issue. But overall it's good to work there.Need to also give alittle more hours."
good,Fast paced environment that is favorable for younger single individuals. Other then that it was fun to work there most days until the Christmas season hit.The it was very stressful for everyone.
good,I believe that management promotes pretty people and not all those who are qualified and they also don’t know the businesses that they manage. It’s a good company run buy young inexperienced people! I do enjoy working there as I know several of the businesses myself but inexperienced management!
good,The hardest thing is standing 10+ hours a day while doing your job.You are able to apply for different roles throughout the building in order to find the best fit for you.
good,"I liked working here. The environment at amazon was was diverse, friendly, busy. I honestly liked working there despite it being a warehouse job. I’d go back if I could."
good,"Amazon spouts a lot of good things and it used to be a wonderful place to work when it first opened up in our nearby city. However, they have compromised on all of the things that made it great and now it's quickly sliding downhill. The managers work 10-11 hour shifts, standing and walking. Associates work 3-5 hour shifts standing, walking, pulling, bending (it tears every ligament, tendon, and muscle you have and give a lot of people rotator cuff injuries and carpal tunnel along with nerve damage in feet and arms) "
good,Great benefits. The people are nice but the management sucks. Amazon have many outside activities which is great fun. They try a keep the employees happy but the new management dont have a clue. They make you think advancement is easy but in reality it is almost impossible
good,Fast paced and long hours. Break times arent long enough as they include the long walk to the canteen. Only good for a temporary job over the holidays.
good,This job isn’t for everyone. You need to be ready to work 10 hours standing or walking. Great benefits. Very physical job You need to work with others sometimes
good,"Long days, short weeks. Good benefits, bad pay. As a manager, leading a team of 30, and walking 15-20 miles a day on hard concrete I was making 17 an hour. Pay is horrible. No bonuses. Good benefits. It is what it is."
good,A typical 10 hr day for me consisted of standing on an Order Picker attached to a harness with a scanner while going in and out of aisles going up and down picking customers orders. Management is pretty good considering they run a pretty tight ship over there. In the duration of the day there is two 15 minute breaks and a half hour lunch. You need to be on your heels as the scanners depict your TOT or time off task. It is a very fast paced environment
good,Long hours during peak season. Lots of Paid Time Off during slow periods. Mandatory Overtime is given at short notice. No pay raises. Benefits were reasonable. Continuously working at a fast pace until each break. I wouldn’t recommend as a career. It’s nice if you just need a job fast until you find what you’re looking for.
good,"Only worked during peak season, they let everyone go after holiday was over. It was a decent job. Management wasn’t the best, but it was also a new facility so they were still learning as well."
good,If you were liked..you moved up. If you were not then you were on raked over the coal. They have a high turnover for a reason...........................
good,"J'ai beaucoup aimé le rythme de travail assez soutenu, ce qui pousse à se dépasser continuellement"
good,Very busy place to work loud and repetitive work easy to comprehend but you must learn good sequencing to be successful at Amazon other than that it’s a good place to earn a descent wage.
good,"Great company to advance yourself and make money.  You'll meet smart people and make long lasting connections.  Eventually you'll get stuck with a terrible manager or director and will hate every moment, but hopefully you'll leave with a good chunk of stock and money in the bank, plus be set up well for your next career move."
good,trained well on operations  by company but mangers do check or ensure that you procedures are followed. my second day there my order picker broke down because none of the maintenance checks were done properly for over a month. Managers chatted more than making sure work was done properly.
good,"Dort wird jeden eine Chance gegeben, Hauptsache fleißig... dort ist es Körperlich anstrengend"
good,"Physical job, leaders have too much power. Human resources is a nightmare. I only stayed because of my co-workers and the pay is manageable. It's like high school all over again."
good,"I loved working at the Amazon sort center, however, they would not give me the hours that were promised. I had no choice but to quit my job and look for another position elsewhere. It was unfortunate I would have liked to stay working there."
good,Easy job but . No job security like union and managers always look like they are stressed. And depending on the neighborhood you in there is a lot of missing packages due to theft. But overall is a good job.
good,Can be pretty clickish place and depending on who you know will give you a greater chance of advancement more than actual work performed or experience
good,I would not work for Amazon fulfillment again.  The place has a culture of wearing you down through long hours and constant fear of being replaced.  The facility did not have chairs to use during your time on the floor.
good,"you drive for 10 hours a day delivering packages, it is a physically demanding job. You don't get benefits for 90 days and if you get hurt while on the job our screwed keep that in mind ,"
good,"Una empresa genial para empezar y ganar experiencia, no tiene el mejor salario y tampoco es muy fácil subir de puesto. No hay mucha "
good,"I was employed by Amazon during the Christmas season which is one of their peak seasons. You are required to work 60 hrs a week during the peak..Five 12 hour days in a row for 3 weeks..Managers pushing you to move non stop the whole time. I worked 2 weeks before this began and about two months after. You are expected to work none stopped and are monitored by your handheld pc..which they speak to you through if you stop moving..time off task..you must stow (put things in bins) or pick (shop for customers,removing things from bins) non stop..its stressful because sometimes bins are so full there is no place to put anything but its your fault if it takes you longer and have no place to put anything..oh and they must be in the bins the correct way even if they're already full. I would only do this job for extra holiday shopping money..otherwise its not worth it.."
good,"I worked there through 7 peak seasons/years.  Over the years I was able to acquire many skills and learned a lot about the industry. I thoroughly enjoyed my responsibilities and jobs throughout the years. My biggest issue was advancement. Despite all my efforts and work I was never able to get above a Tier 1 spot for unknown reasons. Even as I accomplished goals for the company and was able to ensure meeting and exceeding customer demand, I never got the opportunity to prove I could do more. I had numerous fellow Tier 1 employee exceed my rank even though my abilities, reputation, skill set, work ethic and tenure far outweighed theirs. "
good,"we all worked together as a team and with receive and prep areas of the warehouse management seemed to be not so organised with equipment and keeping the work flow going as we was waiting for production at least a hour before we felt the support was lacking daily."
good,I went to Amazon and the work environment is good. The work is very structured. If you thrive in this type of environment and are willing to work hard. The work is there for you. This was a seasonal opportunity and provided a great supplemental income. If you are looking for a full time Job that is regular this is not the place for you as a sorter.
good,"Working at Amazon was an experience that I would not want to have as a career. Friendly environment, nice people, just not the job for me to go to everyday as an employee."
good,"No bad for work the only 2 thing I aways complaining is because I working like 7 day a week no break and I have my family, the other is the pick season is horrible and the manager aways complain about production numbers when is allot people in the warehouse to be fast like normal day."
good,"A typical work day; clock in, grab your scanner and work until break mid-shift. I have learned how to be fast paced and careful. I would say everyone is friendly."
good,During break the workers were able to get to know each other and play table tennis or pool which was a great timing to get to know other workers outside work life.
good,"Dont be late . Pass over the allowed UBT credit & fired!"
good,Stressante senza alcuna garanzia in termini di contratti lavorativi salario accettabile ma inferiore allo stress lavorativo
good,"When driving for Amazon Flex you are able make your own schedule. typically you would log into the app and find a block of time during that same day which would range from 1 to 4 hours.Most of the time I picked up the packages from the Amazon Flex warehouse, but also delivered for Amazon Prime, Whole Foods, and restaurants. It was a lot of driving at times, but a great way to make money on your own time."
good,"Analytics and Media is a new team at Amazon.com and since it is a new team you get a lot of opportunities to learn, drive new projects and grow. However, you would need to have a entrepreneurial attitude towards work to succeed in this team"
good,overall great place pay is the moat convincing to work here extremely high paced not for the lazy literally almost always on your feet time goes by fast
good,"Amazon Web Services is a fast pace and hard working environment. Typical work days are 8 hours minimum up to 16 hours depending on the day. Most of their sites are not centrally located so there's always a commute.  Overall compensation package is good (salary, bonus, stocks) but salary /hr pay by itself is not."
good,"As a company it's a great place to work. It just depends on where you work. As with this warehouse managers tend to ensure their favorites don't do much during their shifts. Rotation in positions are said but rarely ever seen. Just plan on doing the exact same thing every day, not learning others parts, no matter how many times you request to learn. If you bring it up to management you get the ""you're really good"" speech. Even though there's how many others that can ""learn"" to be ""really good""."
good,"Ho lavorato per 3 mesi presso Amazon Logistics a Rogoredo, dormendo di giorno in modo difficile poichè il mondo non si ferma perchè dormi, di notte il lavoro è alienante: spesso ho passato 8h a fare la stessa cosa, in piedi. La pausa è di mezz'ora ogni 4h. La paga è di circa 8 euro all'ora e la possibilità di proroga è nulla se assunti da agenzia."
good,"It's always about hitting rates and once you hit your rates, goals always gets pushed up even higher...working leaner with less people, pushing out higher volume is good for business but at the same time wears out your workers.  If you are lazy and don't like fast pace and 10hr days, over time during peak seasons, then this is not the place for you."
good,"Good for learning how to work in a social environment. Great benefits, the pay is decent. You can get promoted quickly if your willing to relocate. Relocation bonus is offered."
good,"The tasks were easy enough, repetitive and relaxed. They cared about your health and wanted you to succeed. "
good,"No he tenido mala experiencia.es un ritmo rápido,donde todo el mundo va a su puesto de trabajar.dinamica buena,las horas se te pasan rapido porque no paras pero por lo general muy bien"
good,Great work place for people starting new jobs or inbetween jobs. Breaks are paid and you work 5 hour shifts. 10 if they are back to back. 30 minute break between the jobs.
good,Amazon offers great pay for the type of job responsibilities and it perfect for a second job or a student . My only negative criticism of the company is the lower level management is slightly dis organized and seems to lack experience supervising a large work force and tend to treat workers like children.
good,"Fast paced, friendly coworkers and fun environment. Excellent benefits,  help with college and plenty of opportunities for advancement. I would highly recommend this job for anyone under the age of 40"
good,A typical work day started fast and stayed busy throughout my work shift. The people was friendly and they respected each other. The atmosphere was just very busy. I enjoyed going to work because the people.
good,Promotions are slow even woth military experience. Its not what you know its who you know. Hold someone accountable and you are screwed. The culture is great but the political BS is demoralizing.
good,Co-workers are great but some of the managers or leads are not helpful. There is a high turnover of employees. Must make production or they will terminate you. I was not terminated but I do know of people they have terminated because they could not make the numbers. What is so sad is that instead of working with these people that were there everyday they just decided to terminate them. This seems like a company that would rather constantly train new employees that hardly ever show up to work rather then work with the dependable employees that they already have.
good,"it's a great company to work for as a general worker only part time. Far as a making this a career move, I would say yes, but only if you will be in management it comes with perks."
good,it was fun and i enjoy working there for the season everybody come in go to there departments before every shift and after lunch u have alittle meeting no longer then 2min and u do warm and do little excerise. the hardest for me was when there wasn't a lot boxes coming down we had just stand there and wait for boxes those were the slow days its not a lot days like but there are some.the part I enjoy the most was my team members they made the night go by fast
good,"No proper management, very limited hours 20 or less when not in peak season. Not the job to apply if you need money and it is not peak season ( holiday seasons) ."
good,It's okay if you need work and they will work with your hours but it's not a career for someone who is older than 30 years of age and trying to advance quickly.
good,"Great company, innovative - But expect to work long hours - I had no work/life balance from August through December. Met great people, and am thankful for the experience that I gained through working at Amazon."
good,Great place to work. Lots of opportunity to grow. Physical manual labor. Ability to learn new things and go outside your comfort zone. Good hours. Benefits and able to manage your time off.
good,"This job is not for those people who cannot handle fast paced jobs and manual labor. Working nights when moving freight is not easy, but if you can adjust your sleep schedule and need the support than amazon is really helpful. The pay is exceptional, the management there is mostly amazing, and the work is rather simple if not physically taxing. However, only massive complain is that the system in place at my location seems like it was band-aid patched over and over, leading to a lot of new employee confusion"
good,"I worked as an associate on £8.00 to start off with and it was torture. The monotony was not justified on a barely liveable wage however after the pay rise a balance has been achieved. They are installing music into the FC which also helps massively. This should have been done years ago though."
good,"If you're okay with working long hrs for $16 or $17 an hour, Amazon is the place for you. The Job itself doesn't require much thinking but is physically demanding."
good,"Typical day depends on the amount of freight, shift is usually 4 hours, but can flex up to one hour. It's very fast past so the time goes by pretty fast. You will loose weight working there.  The supervisors at RIC5 are nice & respectful. The ambassadors will show you how to work different area's in the warehouse. Everyone there knows our main responsibility are the customers, to make sure packages go out on time & reach their destination.  Hardest part of the job can be handling of the freight if you're not use to lifting so when you get done for the day you go home sore"
good,Picking is boring and fast pace. System seems to favor certain employees to get multiple picks. Which lead them to having high pick number per hour. During peak season people with the highest pick number get rewards.
good,"felt like a prison you had to ask to go to the toilet and management was all over the place..\"
good,"This was a temporary job to keep me working until a better job came along with more money and better benefits. The hardest part of the job is that it is straight manual labor. The most enjoyable part of the job is the discount and also when they want to reward employees with food. The Management is ok, they are there to do a job just like you."
good,"When first starting was lead to believe that conversion to a full employee was not a issue as long as work performance was meet. Come to find out that was not able to even apply for any open jobs as I'm a ""current employee"" will have to reapply most likely starting back as a seasonal employee again once i'm let go."
good,This was my first job and I have been back so I cant say it was not a good job but the work environment can vary because management changes a lot but I am grateful for the experiences
good,"This is a challenging, very fast paced environment. Amazon is family oriented company who treats everyone with respect and has many benefits. This is a company who really values their employees."
good,"Very fast pace. Some of the people donot work collaboratively and I can tell they are there for a pay check.  Two of us complained that there were 3 ladies that were orange jackets (experienced people) that were constantly talking in their native tongue.  I saw the same ladies the second day of my training on another line that was doing the same thing.  Just from this observation, on my second day I got a negative impression, but since I was new I did not know protocol nor the culture. Now 14 days later I witnessed the same thing with the same ladies. I asked one of them to help me lift a heavy package, she walked pass me as though I had not said a word."
good,Easy work. just have to be willing to work. There are ling hours and mandatory OT during December 60 hrs a week. Its not easy but mandible. Everything is computerized. .
good,It's laid-back. Rules change all the time. Management finds little things to complain about. Overall it's easy work. Do your job and you will be fine.
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Amazon for the most part. It is a strenuous job where you are on your feet for 10 hours a day. Most entry level positions don't require a lot of brain power, but more just common sense. I was given proper training and accommodation for the positions I was in. The communication between leaders seems to be lacking in some areas. The fulfillment center is new and they are still working out all of the kinks and issues, which is to be expected. I enjoyed the team atmosphere. However, I don't feel challenged mentally."
good,"Management was terrible. The work environment is very fast pace, and if you cannot hit rate then start looking for another job. The dock outbound works you like a dog."
good,"Loads of intelligent and friendly people work at Amazon. They will, however, demand more work from you then you can deliver in 40 hours per week and that workload can vary quite unpredictably."
good,Very flexible had decent hours but not enough at the time. Self learning was excellent. All training done online at your own pace. The scheduling was based on hours that you were available.
good,The management teams at Amazon are fantastic. They jump right in and work with you. The only problem at Amazon is the treatment if you are injured on the job. Your manager works with you to accommodate your injury but the AmCare team will not!! You can spend all day in pain and they won’t treat you.
good,"4 star rating overall "
good,"Can be a fun place to work at times depending on the shift manager. You need to know your health&safety or you could get injured. You have to be able to stand up for yourself because of employee intrusiveness. Set your boundaries and you will be OK."
good,"Standard warehouse work that anyone can expect in that kind of job. The corporate mentality was no surprise either, your ""numbers"" are what is important while maintaining a semblance of quality. Management changed very often in the short time I was there, so you had to adapt to a variety of personality types and management styles. Your co-workers were what made the job enjoyable, as the pay for that part of the country was to low for the rising cost of living. I have heard that their base pay has increased corporate wide, so that may no longer be as big of an issue."
good,"I loved working at Amazon, unfortunately it didn't work out due to financial hardship. The environment there was amazing. It felt nice to not be pressured into dressing a certain way or having to act a certain way. They accept anyone and everyone. I love that they're lenient as long as you do your job."
good,"Amazon is a very fast pace job with little to no down time. I was hired on as seasonal, and was moved up to the highest ranking position available for seasonal. I'm looking for a job in which I can continue to grow with the company.  Im seeking long term employment that will provide for my family. Due to the hours I work for Amazon as well as the seasonal position, this job was not suited for me."
good,"Per chi ama i lavori fisici e faticosi è il luogo di lavoro ideale."
good,"Can be stressful on busy days like Christmas with no salary increase or anything, you are stuck with the same salary without growth opportunities. I had enjoyable conversations with the customers as most of them are in love with the comany, I am sure I'd have loved working for Amazon more if only we had the same benefits as U.S emloyees, Mexican law allows 6 days of vacations on the first year."
good,"On a typical day I would either do the three roles. I could be a person who makes sure that the packages that come down the conveyor belt have the address labeled up, I could be a diverter who takes packages off conveyor belt and puts it in aisle number order onto carts, lastly is a sorter which takes the packages off carts and puts in my bag order. ie. 13.1.5."
good,very fast paced job very self efficient job you do most things there by your self if you have any questions that is when you call a manager or get help.
good,"it was okay job, no advancement and no suck days. not the best but as a student good enough for me and my situation with also going to school and working."
good,Lots of political stuff goes on behind the scenes and doesn't foster an environment of cooperation and working towards a common goal for the company or team.
good,"fast paced. long work days. you work hard there is opportunities for extra training. needs better management, co-workers are fun to work with. the hardest part is making the out outrageously high hourly rate. you do not make it then they wan't to write you up. breaks are actually shorter then they tell you they are. they count the time it takes you to get from your work area to the break room in with your break times."
good,"It's part-time, labor intensive, enjoy co-workers, have a happy attitude. Accept any and all additional training. Be friendly and cooperative with all fellow co-workers."
good,Mostrre impegno  raggiungere I target  non fare sbagli e chiedere aiuto
good,"A typical day work is always long and stressful. This establishment doesn`t care about it workers. This job cares more about numbers than your safety, and your heath. The sad part about the job is that they aspect you not to slow down we are human every thing is scheduled. lets say I don't feel well and just need a break before the end of a quarter. if I were to take a break that break diminishes my number and I could face repercussions. I think the hardest part of the job is at the end of every shift being told that you aren`t doing enough or you need to do more. The most annoying aspect of the job is being told every twenty minutes or so to speed up."
good,It’s a very “who do you know”environment if you want to get promoted or further trained; not good so just keep that in mind and the managers are not that great but besides that its a very nice place to work.
good,Amazon is good for a kid that just graduated high school. However I am not an entry level person and I need something else that excercises my skills..
good,"Amazon is great as long as you are okay with repetitive work, handling heavy objects on occasion, don't mind your every minute being critiqued and counted, and can handle 10 hour work days. You can advance if you put yourself out there and perform well enough if you're looking to pursue management positions. If not, they do have tuition assistance for certain degrees, and accommodate your class schedule regardless of your degree. It helps to have basic computer skills as well, as most of your work is done with some form of computing device. "
good,Poor work life balance in warehouse. Excellent perks in corporate.  Lots of opportunity to advance uf you have the correct management backing you. Long hours.
good,"Amazon is a good place to work if you're looking for mindless part-time work that is highly flexible. They offer Verified Extra Time (VTE) if you like to pick up an extra shift every now and then; Verified Time Off (VTO), most of the time, if you have a shift in priorities. If you are unable to get VTO for a shift you have to miss; you can use your Un-Paid Time off (UPT) that deduct time out of your bank when you miss a shift. You receive an additional 20 hours of UPT, every quarter. Overall, it's a pretty good place to work, if you don't mind fast-paced physical labor."
good,This is a fast paced job and easy to get used to. Not a hard job to get done and is not tiring. You can get a shift that can work around your schedule.
good,"Cut-Throat environment as a Data Center Technician, tickets to work are hard to come by and when they are plenty of tickets they get stolen by other Technicians. Not every site is like this, if you have a lead that knows what he is doing he'll assign tickets to Techs to get them started."
good,It was an ok place to work. Lots of hrs at Christmas but thats to be expected. I enjoyed getting to me new people but like any other job it has its ups and downs.
good,"Amazon gave me the necessary tools and training to hone and develop my leadership skills throughout the time I worked for the company. However, the company does not promote from within very often and requires an extensive amount of hours to be put in. This company is not a good place to work for someone seeking work-life balance."
good,"The job itself was easy, it was very physical and very repetitive.  The Culture is what is wrong with Amazon, it also depends on the manager. Most managers don't actually care about their associates and aren't very helpful. Out of approximately 25 managers in my "
good,The place is a good company to work for. The scheduling is way off balanced. Every 3-6 months its a mandatory shift change which is so inconvenient. The management has poor communication skills.
good,I was required to lift heavy boxes. They were supposed to be no more than 50lbs. However some were more than 50lbs. There was no air conditioning except in break room.  I will not work as a warehouse associate again.  I would consider a different position with Amazon.  They really have a good business model.
good,Amazon venait d'ouvrir le travail était donc très dur car il n'y avait aucune organisation de la part des responsable sans dénigré l'entreprise bien évidemment j'émets juste un avis qui n'est propre qu'a moi et moi seul évidemment
good,"I've been with two different types of buildings now over the course of 5 years. Sort centers are WAY more organized than AMZL stations! Poor management always seems to be the morale killer... It can be fun but that's all up to management. You feel overworked, underpaid, and undervalued a lot of the time in the part time buildings. Can't speak for fulfillment centers. In most part time buildings there's slim chances of advancement. They are VERY frugal."
good,"When I first hired on, I was able to work 6 days a week, but then they cut back the days to only 3.  I would like to work more days and hours so i can take care of my family and responsibilities."
good,A Typical day at work went be very busy. I learned that it is very challenging.Management is not helpful.The hardest part about the job is making sure that you scanned the packages that you put on the pallet.
good,Good learning experience for logistics field position very fast paced . Must be prepared to multi task and have managers straight out of college with no warehouse experience.
good,"A great place for a college student,  but not for a person needing a full time income. You work 18 hours a week with the chance to work more during holidays, which ends up being about $180/week."
good,starting off and gaining the experience is great but staying there permanently inst so good you will notice that most of your check is going towards benefits
good,"Drive and deliver customer products to their desired drop off location in a timely manner."
good,"Long hours, solid team members, but the work environment is brutal.  There is very little work/live balance.  The pay and benefits do not make up for lost family time.  Culture prefers to promote from outside, burn them out, and replace them as opposed to promoting from inside."
good,"I believe this particular facility has little value for employees over 45.  There is almost no active help in facilitating chances of promotion or transfer.  Most of management is bearable, the first level more in tune with workers, but the second level of management is more disconnected.  Culture is stressful.  "
good,Good entry level job for anyone. Easy work. Good job ethics. Not physically draining. But you’ll still feel like you worked and earned a check. I liked working here.
good,"The facility is clean and well organized.The breakrooms are well stocked and clean. The work is physical demanding but do-able. Standard production work, pay, breaks and lunch breaks. For me, the hardest parts of the job was working all night and trying to keep up with the productivity rate. I was not able to adapt to that combination. "
good,"I worked the late shift and I would get there and use my ID card to get in and clock in for work. we would stretch and depart into our job stations... we would work for so many hours then have a break the finish what we started and clock off.. during the holidays we would have over time. they are very strict on following the rules so don't break any. if you want to move up, just say so and prove your work ethic and you'll be noticed."
good,It's a ok job it should be full time managers have smart mouths and talk behind your back no paid time off most of the ambassadors don't know all the job functions
good,"interesting place to work. Great for first job out of school for advancement placement for career. If your looking for place to have fun and work in a structure environment, then amazon is the place for you."
good,"Work began 30-45 minutes before shifts for managers with a pre-shift meeting to discuss the goals and metrics the team was striving to meet. Depending on your department and whether you reached those metrics, work could end before end of shift or well after. Management and culture varied dramatically building-to-building but the most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to influence change and make decisions."
good,"working in amazon fulfillment centers can be challenging physically and in terms of work hours."
good,"shift started with stretching exercises, brief meeting on previous days work. had a daily schedule of work tasks which changed daily."
good,"The day normally starts off busy, but then it will slow down a little. A lot of times, the days go by slow since it is the same thing, every day. Its a little hard for me then. But I do love meeting all the new people, although they sometimes discourage talking while working."
good,A typical day at work can be very unpredictable as people get bounced around in the areas where they are needed. The company does offer good benefits but the work is very demanding on the body.
good,"Great opportunity, but management teams can be clique-ish, which could impact future advancement opportunities.  Within daily operations, work-life balance is challenging."
good,hardest part of the job is the 10 hours with 2 10 min breaks. your feet hurt soo very badly. there are very high expectations on productivity and quality. some days it is very easy to meet the goals and some days it is nearly impossible
good,"Amazon has great leadership principles and many fantastic projects. However, culture isn't the same in different parts of the company, in spite of similar roles."
good,"Heavy loads each day that had to be delivered. "
good,Enjoyed working daylight shift. Time was never an issue it always seemed to fly and before you know it it was time to clock out.The staff and leads were helpful and made you walk away confident on the question or training you needed.
good,"I learned many new skills working at Amazon, However i did not like the fact that they force you to work at different stations before fully mastering one."
good,"counting bins, making the number rate, picking numerous of items for customers. got to meet a lot of new and outgoing people every time they was new hiring."
good,"The Amazon culture is very stressful, managers play favorites. I worked there while going to school. It will work with your school schedule. You only have to work 20 hours to be considered full time while going to school."
good,"No stress in this job, well at least when you come from a sales background, Easy £350 a week. People in this factory/warehouse are the reason people go back, i was on the N/S, great squad."
good,"This job was very fast paced but not timed. The breaks between the groups were not as long as expected, longer breaks would help for those who don't have lockers."
good,Amazon was a great place to work in the beginning. I feel your management is what will make or break a company and honestly the management at my warehouse (SDF9) broke it.
good,"Picking & packing delivery routes, responsible for your route, great teamwork, training new employees, paid vacations, located in an expensive suburb of Moonachie, warehouse is clean and organized for the most part"
good,The pay is too little. The days are long and there is only two 15 minute breaks and 30 minute lunch (which is unpaid). Is a good job for a young kid but not for grown adults who need money for bills.
good,"Performance driven. Making rate is absolutely necessary or you are out. High expectations from employees with many barriers that make it hard to always make the numbers. Very fast paced. Not for the frail or weak. Your body will be worked. Standing, bending, walking, lifting. Keep a note pad with you. If a barrier happens. Call it out, jot it down. Manager communication is inparative on your part. CYA!! It is up to you to watch out for rate and find out where you are at during the week. Quality is important too. While performing with lightening speed you must also keep quality standards which is a given. It feels impossible but goals are obtainable. All and all its a decent place to work. They say pay is competitive with other companies in the area. However, no cost of living increase. Minimum wage goes up but the start up pay doesn't. They say the rest of the compensation package makes it better which includes Medical, dental, vision, 401k, RSU Stocks. Good plans but pricey for the employees. Comes out of check bi weekly if you opt in for benefits. Management constantly changes. They are always changing something in the building. They call it Innovation. Not always straight forward with employees not sure if it's on purpose or A doesn't talk to B before communicating to C.  lot of things will not make sense but I guess there's a method to thier madness, it seems to work for the company. While at times you can feel like just a number and replaceable they do nice things for employees too like occasionally a catered lunch, pizza parties. Holidays we usually get a yummy treat."
good,"Amazon is good paying job. It is very fast pace and challenging. The  supervisors or managers are very demanding, so your going to have to work very hard. The health benefits are excellent. It great for a young person started off in life that want to work."
good,"A day with full of fun and learning new things and with great workplace culture."
good,"If you like to walk and move all around some boxes okay, people is good culture and can find many new friends. Management its not what you expect, they think you are machine and you have to do all fast and relocated all time to new place to help somebody that work slowly or just have more work there, so don't show that you work fast bcz they will send you to the most difficult place all time."
good,"I disdain from complaining and neglect pointless reviews. It's a job like a job is a job, aka job-like in its job-like nature. For jobs you must do a job."
good,"I was a temp, so not much of any benefits or job security.They had us move around to many different job functions within receiving. I was told I was one of the best Kiva pod scanners and would like get hired full time, didn't happen."
good,"Bonne entreprise, bon management, bonne équipe, parking immence"
good,"I would go into work. Walk to the Stand Up area. We would hear announcements and stretch , look on the work board as to where our assigned station is for the day. Login to our station scan the totes. Grab a box off the line. Scan it count the items while scanning. Sort in the totes or reseal the box, or Send the products into the totes. "
good,"Very productive but also very stressful.  Seem to be no more than a number.  Not very consistent.  High turnover.  If you don't mind a fast pace workplace and can make rates, it's  great place to work.  But your pay caps at 3 years unless you get promoted, which doesn't really seem to be a fair process.  More of who you know and not what you know."
good,"You get two 10 min breaks with a 2.5 min walk time from your station to break and 2.5 min walk time back to your station, if you are late you will get in trouble. There is a 30 min non paid lunch break which goes by way to quick, pretty much have to scarf down your food. if you're slow this job is not for you. You will get write ups for going too slow and if you get 3 write ups you're gone. They said its temperature controlled but it feels around 78-80 at all times. Starting April 1st the schedule will be four 10 hour shifts with 3 days off. All the managers I have met are very cool."
good,Not a bad place to work for a short while. Most managers are cool. Others are very bad.. Pay is too little for the stress involved with the job. Not enough hours.
good,"if you do not mind working long hours in a hot climate then this job is for you."
good,"Great benefits, simple job, relaxed work environment. The company will promote from within but you receive the responsibility but no pay increase. To use the restroom you have to stand in long lines using your entire break. If you use the restroom while on the clock the line leads yell and question the length even though its a long walk across the building"
good,"4 Days on 3 Days off is a struggle but once you get your stamina, 10 hr work days are doable. Productivity is graded and you have to make rate, but if you work at a consistent pace its very easy to make rate."
good,"I worked for Amazon for over a year.  There were continual management changes until the last 4 months I was there, then it stabilized.  However, policy changed every time the floor manager changed.  Generally a good management team, but still had a few problems.  They give you a set amount of unpaid days per quarter, but if you go so much as one hour over that, you are fired.  Be aware that they have 100 people waiting on your job.  I became seriously ill at the end of November and went over my unpaid time off limit. I was told to bring all kinds of paperwork from the hospital and my doctor.  But, was then informed by HR that I was still fired.  I hold no grudges, especially since I knew their policy.  It can be very boring during off season and at that time you will be lucky to hit fifteen hours a week.  Then during the holidays, you can work as many as sixty hours a week.  You will meet people from all over the world and it's a fast paced environment."
good,"Pack out single shipments, pack out multiple shipments, rebin, slam, dock. Problem solve which includes running shift when PA (process assistant) is not present, getting cpts (Critical pull times) packed out and on the truck on time, solving packer’s problems, and being creative when faced with an unusual problem. Often times stressful."
good,The there are great the only thing I disliked about working for this particular company was the breaks were rushed as you were working 11 hours standing
good,"The cultural work day is very micro-managed as if we are in prison."
good,"Good for a first job, but not  a place you want to move up in.  Would recommend working here during their peak from October to December when they offer a lot of overtime"
good,a very good place to work trained you well in all aspect of the jobs .management had good communication always kept busy and friendly good people to work with
good,"Amazon is a fast paced work environment. Benefits are excellent. They give you a lot of excused time off, but you need it to recover from Prime week and Peak season. It's hard on your body."
good,"A place to sharpen your skills, push yourself, and learn at scale."
good,"Very fast-paced, more about quantity than quality. It's hard to care about doing a better job when those around you don't care enough. Only offer 4 hour shifts and can be flexed up/down by 1 hour."
good,"Virtual job taking inbound calls. Hired to assist customers with returns, exchanges, placing orders and inquiries about arrival dates of merchandise. I really liked working there but major portion of inbound calls were from irate customers who vented their anger strongly before allowing you to assist them.  I enjoyed most the happy people who just wanted to place an order or wanted information and who were happy with the assistance I provided.  I liked working from home but that also posed problems in that my supervisor went on vacation so when I started I was on my own and felt lost for awhile.  During the holiday season they also offered as much overtime as you wanted.  I would have liked to stay but it was just seasonal and no benefits.  I learned empathy and to keep smiling no matter what."
good,At Amazon I was a packer along with many other packers and we would compete with each other. I can't lie it was  fun. Unfortunately it was only a temporary job.
good,"There is a vibe and energy at Amazon that is awesome for the right person, at the right time in their career.  You can make things happen quickly, but the pipe is so big, you need to commit 24/7."
good,"Work experience is awesome."
good,The job is very fast paced. There are a lot of packages thrown at you at once. Wish they could pay you more for the amount of work that they give you.
good,"Amazon is one of the biggest retailers in the world. Production based and safety focused distributor."
good,"Work consisted of a lot of walking and a lot of lifting. You are required to go as fast as they ask you to, ""rate"". There were times making the rate was possible and there were other times it was not. There was a lot of different functions to learn and they give a lot opportunity to move up within Amazon. The managers rarely stay for long periods of time. Some who came in were fair and some were not. The hardest part of the job is that it is hard labor and you are there for 10 hours. Your co workers is what makes it most enjoyable. Amazon is awesome for hiring a lot of different people and it is very nice to meet them all."
good,"You get paid decently for the work you do with raises depending on how long you work there. The work is physically demanding (you lift up to 50lbs all day everyday) and you have to be able to stand and walk all day. You get benefits from day one including PTO, dental, medical, vision, 401K, stocks, and more. However, they are VERY serious about meeting quotas, days off, and perfection. You have to be 100% on your rate, quality, safety and time off task 100% of the time. Management will favor others. One little mistake could cost you your job (even for leaving or coming back from break 1 minute too early or too late once). They aren’t really understanding if you are sick or if you need time off for emergency. You have to use your PTO or UPT and if you don’t have any time for some reason then you are basically screwed. Mandatory overtime will be called especially around holidays (Christmas time) were you will have to work up to 60 hours a week no exceptions (which is good if you need extra money). But, typically you work 4 days a week, 10 hour days with three days off during the week. If you are working 60 hour weeks it is either 12 hour days 5 days a week or 10 hour days 6 days a week. They do raffles around prime week and peak season which is when you work overtime and they giveaway gift cards and prizes."
good,decent place to work. very fast paced. Ambassadors/trainers were always extremely thorough with the training on how to accomplish each task. Management was also helpful
good,"If you like to work hard, a good paycheck, and meeting new people then Amazon is the place for you.  Not likely to be long term unless you like a lot of change"
good,I did not work there long enough to really give a great picture of what to expect. I enjoyed my time there and it's probably different now. It would be better to ask someone that's worked there more recently.
good,I worked there for a seasonal position. The work was very easy and the rates were very obtainable. The management was very friendly but never introduced themselves to new workers.
good,"due to the competitive nature of the company, environment can be very cut throat with high churn of management. a large corporate company with typical political issues."
good,"The fast paced environment makes the day zoom by.  Most co-workers are not team players, Management communicate with employees on a timely and friendly manner."
good,empresa dedicada a la compra online me ha servido para adquirir experiencia para trabajar haciendo picking.
good,I your are a college student and needing a part-time job this would be a job for you. Also there is some heavy lifting envolve in the job and you are on your feet all day too.
good,"All long as you're not lazy, you'll be fine."
good,"learned time management and working under pressure, lots of hard labor, the enjoyable part was being able to move up and going up quickly, nice environment"
good,"The culture was easy going but very competitive, managers were Hard on a select few, nevertheless it was a great work environment, and i would refer this job to any of my friends."
good,"Amazon is a huge company with many FC centers throughout the UK. However this does not mean its a good place to work. the job role and requirements themselves are not only easily but easily met as well but the amount of staff members i've had encounters with are rude, condescending, patronizing, arrogant and generally have a lack of respect for new staff members. i have been countless-ly spoken too on a number of occasions rudely. the phrases used most by the staff members are as follows "" Oi you get here now !"", ""  i don't know so i cant help you."" and my personal favorite is "" i dont really care."""
good,"I was basically receiving items and scanning them into their bins for the pickers to pick. I was also tidying up bins, running carts and also doing some picking. Hours were long and you walk a long way each shift but its what it is, you don't expect a holiday camp now. Staff were friendly and helpful. My contract was however abruptly terminated due to the lack of communication from the agency I was working for."
good,You get what you put into it.  If you are willing to consistently work and be dependable you will go far.  If you are just there for an easy paycheck and are not reliable you will hate it.
good,12 hours on your feet with 2 15 min brakes anoutb7 hurs apart and one 23 minute lunch brake your walking at least 5 miles per day because of job duties
good,"Focus was on productivity but being a temp position, predictable work schedule was impossible to get. Never knew schedule or hours on a week to week basis"
good,Great for people who are into fast paced work and can handle extreme stress during their busy season. Lots of fun and interesting people who you can be personable with. But be ready to work the exact same schedule for the rest of your time there.
good,You can move up quickly. I became an ambassador (after 2 months) but had to leave because of unforseen circumstances. Wish I could go back where I left off. Worked hard for that promotion.
good,I enjoyed working at Amazon it was just to short they try to help me out by showing me how to get faster but it did not work out. Friendly people to work with.
good,"Worked mostly 11-12 hours a day Sunday though Thursday nights"
good,A typical day is going to stand up in the morning with your team mates looking where you are assigned for the day and repeating the same for lunch.  There pretty much goes about your day everyday same thing.
good,"A lot of people seem to like working here. They pay pretty well, especially if you work nights/weekends. 10 hr shifts can be very tiring. Always making changes"
good,"I enjoyed myself in the time that I was employed at Amazon. My schedule was part time so I only worked 20 hours per week unless it was holiday season then there was room for extra days to work. I learned how to use a scanner. The managers were ok, I feel they could have helped out more on the floor when we were short staffed or behind schedule instead of just walking around & giving orders. The hardest part of the job was standing the entire shift. The most enjoyable part was that I did meet a lot of nice people from different cultures while working there."
good,"Amazon is a big company that changes almost monthly internally.  This is good because it is exciting.  It is disappointing because you are almost never told when and what changes will be made.  The company is a true advocate for its customers, but because it is so big it has a difficult time being a watchdog for all of them.  It is not for a lack of effort."
good,"no job satifation when complete, word hard hits targets and dont get reakonized for it long long hours only thing thats good is the pay. managers and blue badges holders look down at you with no respect"
good,You never spend your money due to always working. Peak season is even harder. Up to 6 ten hour days. They did offer VTO after Peak season. Perks should be better but Heath and dental is great!
good,"This job is flexible. The management is okay and you can accumulate sick time fast. They always offer extra days for work, but you can only max out at 35 hours unless approved by upper management. This job provides you with an insight of how a warehouse environment can be and how you can easily make friends."
good,"I think it's a cool company to work for although I wish I can some type of compensation such as work benefits however the work is steady, relaxing and too stressful"
good,all day long was working from one side to another was really active place but poor poor management few were good but was a good place  to work with a lot of benefit .
good,"Working at a Amazon FC can be great experience. But the hard part about working there is making sure you are fulfilling peoples orders in a timely manner. As a picker you have to reach a 390 goal with scanning items everyday and that can be hard for some people, but if you don't reach that goal you can be written up for it."
good,Simple part time job not hard and you get paid every week. Everyones pretty nice and mangers are pretty cool. The work enviorment is chill and relaxed.
good,"There's a huge disconnect between management and entry level but the pay, benefits, and people are generally great.  It's also a bit difficult to get employee voices heard despite an open door policy and hr team on site."
good,poor management no compassion.the job was great aslong as u do what ur suppose to however. someone who didnt agree with my life style of a transgenderness lied and said i was stealing with no proof or evidence they termiated me wrongfully.
good,Great place for fresher to launch their career and people in the company are ready to guide and help in the development of one's career. the workplace in the Amazon is great.
good,"seniority doesn't matter"
good,"i am on a contract basis and i still work here now. Its a great working place and the tools they use and the hardware they use are great and the management of the hardware is too good independent on any other external companies, they have their own OS."
good,I was go in at 11:15pm and leave at 5:45 am. I would pick packages by my assigned nest. And sort by addresses. I learned that working in Logistics is fast paced and not easy. Management would keep a close on you to insure positive work preformance.
good,"tres bonne entreprise "
good,"Amazon is a good place to work if you are willing to put in allot of time there.  There is little work life balance if you want to work your way up in the company.  If you want to stay in the same spot, put in the normal 40 hours.  You will need to put in more then 50 to 60 hours a week if you want to be noticed."
good,what I learn a lot from Amazon is challenge myself to learn how problem solve works. I learn how to manage the time and make sure it is get send it out ASAP..
good,"Very easy to learn and the job itself was not hard at all. But It was monotonous, same thing every day. As a receiver you're on your feet for 10 hours a day stuck in the same spot. Very short breaks. Management was never anywhere to be found, didn't actually meet my manager until my 3rd week of work."
good,My cousin has recommend me this site and said he is 100% sure that i m gonna be happy.hope i am going to find a good job soon. Love indeed  . I reckon best in the world
good,fast paced work. just be careful and make sure you are doing what you are supposed to do and everything will be alright. they do notice your hard work and it will get noticed.
good,I liked it . It was very crowded . There is a lot of people working there .. I hardly ever talked to the supervisor or manager . The breaks are short .
good,Many supervisors walk around giving orders but won't help move the work along. A lot of complaining lazy employees. Machine breaks down constantly slowing work productivity.
good,its a nice place to work they were really nice i just dident talk how everything was never im order . there was some hard parts where they dident know where to put you to work some days
good,Good place to work but you see employees come and go due to not enough or bad training. You receive benefits and time off on day one. Breaks are not long enough.
good,They do not really care about your health. I was a picker and I had asthma issues. I coukd not make rate and they fired me for that reason and never accomodated me even with a doctors note.
good,"Typical day is getting prepared for what may happen."
good,"Promises were made and management did not follow through for a full time position and also advancement to be a line lead. None of those things happened so therefor, I wouldn't go back there"
good,The life of working in a warehouse is hard on the mind and body. Long hours are rough and at time impossible to get through.  The payout however is worth the strain  from day to day
good,Amazon is brand company...its started in 2011 in Bangalore city..this is online shopping  company..this is very largest company. and Amazon is Asia's  no 1 company  in doing the work for online  shopping....
good,"It was generally a nice place to work. Fast paced, big on safety, strict on time off and breaks. I enjoyed the people (well most of them).Management was good until they switched , they did that to much.The hardest part was advancing."
good,It may not seem like a lot at first but being a shipping associate does take patience and will interfere with your sleeping schedule and social life. I worked overnight so i slept during the day most of the time. I would get very short breaks and had to lift sometimes 80 pound boxes and still maintain a fast rate of storing 150+ boxes per hour
good,I have sometime fun in amazon. work pressure is too high. but salary is not satisfied against the job work. And permotion chance is very low in amazon.
good,The process and functions are standardized in a way that makes the employee process flow easy and self explanatory. They do lack a concrete structure for area mangers and can improve on company culture.
good,"Amazon is one of the best place to work with employee friendly policies and good workplace. But the only disadvantage is that salary fro employees are very less. Compared to industry standards, employees pay grade is very less."
good,This is a fast paced dynamic environment to work in. It is extremely demanding with no work life balance.. It is exciting and fun for some and extremely difficult for others.
good,It's a good job overall hours are long but you do get 3 days off a week so you cannot complain the staff at Amazon are very approachable if you ever had a problem.
good,"Very good place to work for starters. The learning opportunities are at a very minimum level. Still in the start up phase, never know things might improve."
good,"Scanning, wrapping, and shipping packages off to customers. Working a typical day at amazon was easy, but management was always on us and trying to look for reasons to write us up. The hardest part of this job would probably be wrapping because it takes a lot of upper body strength just to wrap one pallet."
good,"The atmosphere was a good one for me, everyone was pretty friendly but they'll fire you without warning or knowledge of why you're now out of work. It's an easy job though, very little pay."
good,"Easy to get your foot in the door, but can be cut throat to keep it there... getting noticed is easy but getting recognition in a company with a growth rate like Amazon and you get left in the dust."
good,Every day was fast paced. I learned how to manage associates in a highly controlled environment.The hardest part of the job was staying on cue with having 5 diiferent managers at one time and trying to satisfy them all.
good,"Although the late finishes were disruptive to home life, the work itself and especially the other staff at Amazon were nothing short of incredible."
good,A typical day at work was real stressful. I say that because nothing is organized they work you like slaves and nothing ever goes right with the pay. Management never help with problems when asked.
good,"My main concern with working with the company was balancing work life and home life. The hours were long and labor strenuous on your body. By time you got off work you were too tired to do anything let alone eat. Then its back to bed to get up and do it all over again. The benefits are good though. The other employees were nice and there is a good atmosphere, the job just isn't for me."
good,"Handling Team"
good,End to End Recruitment with no micro management. Ownership given to execute and impement new strategies at work. Stakeholder relationship built with understanding of the need and working accodingly.
good,"The best part about this place is that the management team makes it a fun place to work.  It is a physically demanding job, but the benefits are great."
good,"Nice place to work, supervisor are very co-op and also good  environment with nice and co-op people, I learn a lot at amazon, work as an ambassador to help the associate."
good,"All'interno dell'azienda si respira un'aria socievole, i responsabili sono molto comprensivi, anche se devo dire che i ritmi di lavoro sono molto elevati."
good,"The jobs aren't bad, but there;s a pay cap for tier one associates. Moving up can vary depending on your building, and transferring to other buildings can be hard. Management care about numbers, but they don't pay enough attention to what's really going on as opposed to their computers."
good,management likes to be heard but them themselves dont like to listen needs improvements. Healthcare was great benefits and the extra that they offer works awesome. life/work balance not so much you pretty much year round unless you use your time to take off to enjoy most holidays with your family.
good,Le plus difficile a mon poste est de marché sur de longue distance avec des chaussures de sécurité et de porté de lourde charge.
good,I learned a lot about myself while at Amazon. I learned perseverance and how to be dedicated to my work. I felt that Amazon wasn't the right place for me once I mastered my skills and was unable to advance due to not earning a Bachelors degree. I will now graduate in May.
good,"The work is hard. You're on your feet 10-12 hours a night, and you are moving that whole time. Only get a 30 min lunch, and for the most part, you're exhausted when you're done. During peak seasons you work 6 days a week. So not much time down. But the paychecks are huge at that time."
good,"Overall a good place to work. My job consist of problem solving. Correcting merchandise that came into the warehouse wrong.  Plus I also did Receiving, Stow and Picking of merchandise also."
good,"I have been working there about 3 months and it was tough at work. Again, it is my first job experience. Environment workplace is very fast pace. I love their job but basically, they keep changing new rules every day. Everyone are confusing about new rules every time."
good,"A typical day at the office included software updates, product releases, training, customer support, answering phone calls, training peers and coaching sessions."
good,"La única queja que tengo esque la ett que nos contrato nos vendió muy bien la oferta asegurando que trabajando bien nos quedabamos en la empresa prácticamente seguro y al mes y medio me encontre en la calle, cuando habia dejado un empleo fijo por estar alli"
good,"Never a dull moment "
good,Good benefits comes with headaches from management production is alright to work with with the right management. Expect a high turnover rate with production managers.
good,"I worked at nights, the management was ok they worked with you hands on. the work place is very big and loud. the hardest part is pushing the cart full of items. the enjoyable part of the job was payday."
good,Amazon is a very demanding job. Its hard to keep up and had a lot of inside politics. It's a good place to make money because you get paid weekly.
good,"The first 5 months flew by before i knew it! I am a reserves customer service associate working from home. The reserves program is excellent for flexibility but it also takes a strongly independent individual to complete the training and work day in and day out without ever meeting or even speaking with another Amazon employee. Regardless, the atmosphere is awesomely positive. Our customers adore us and that makes for a great feeling of satisfaction. "
good,"Really smart people, a lot of opportunity for growth, always encouraged to be innovative, think big, and create something new. Competitive salary and benefits with other major tech companies. 100% self motivating work environment. No dress code and 4 legged friends are welcome."
good,"Working at Amazon can be rewarding if you put your mind to it. A typical day at Amazon for me is packaging orders and making sure product is not damaged. I learned that a lot of different aspects go into the process of finding the items, packaging orders and shipping them out. Management is pretty well rounded, and easy to talk to. My co-workers are the most enjoyable part of working at Amazon, they keep you going throughout the day."
good,"Amazon is a very Customer centric company where the customer is always first.A good place to work at as long as you are a master of your trade.Start performing from Day 1 All your colleagues will be super smart.Friendly environment to work in, but know your stuff.Automation at its best and everything is self-service.No spoon feeding"
good,"Poorly managed, careless employees, results driven culture, if you don't meet expectations you're quickly removed. All you are is a number. Good for a quick job because the pay and compensation are decent, not as good as some jobs but better than most."
good,overall the job was demanding. some departments more demanding than others. The job work/life balance was difficult. long hours somewhat underpaid for a supervisor job. difficult to get in touch with HR.
good,It was seasonal and full of workers.great place to work and its conveniently close to where i lived . the pay was great and so was the staffing agents
good,Great place to work good benefits. Long work days 10 hours a day. Great 4 day work weeks. Bins are high and low to reach. A lot of rules for a strict timekeeping of work environment.
good,"Great place to work laid back atmosphere friendly staff and employees,clean working environment team driven employees working hand in hand in order for completion of duties"
good,"fast pace but easy to learn on your feet for 10 hours a day good pay and great benefits , however not very consitant with everyday work flow, must be able to lift up to 25 pounds , everyone there are pretty friendly,  the hardest part is getting use to being on your feet for 10 hours and the lifting"
good,Hard work but worth it. Good culture and always useful to have Amazon UK on your CV. Early starts not a problem after a week. Work targets were a bit tough but I still coped with the temporary contract.
good,its a cool job but we do not be busy enough sometimes. some managers have favorites but its is a pleasant environment to work in. the most enjoyable part of the day is lunch get to interact with coworkers a little help us know each other more and be able to work together
good,"The role was interesting with good hands-on experience. It was a quick-paced organization where the encouraged to fail quick and learn faster. The management, however, was ill-equiped."
good,"Travail surveiller, cadence à la chaîne, évolution si affinités."
good,My normal day on the Ship Dock at Amazon is very busy and fast-paced. I learned not to miss opportunities. Management is alright but doesn't seem to listen to their associates' ideas. Co-workers are pretty easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is making sure that all of our critical departing loads leave the building at specific times. The most enjoyable part of my job is operating the forklift.
good,le côté agréable est de pouvoir mettre en évidence les produits dans le salon et en vitrine pour faire évoluer la vente
good,Das komossinern der wahre  und das prüfen der wahren Eingange
good,"Amazon is easy to work with but you have limited hours for time off and they don't give you extra time off if you get sick, if your kids get sick, or if a emergency comes up. if you have to leave and you have no time off you can take a leave of absence but you have to take it for 14 days without pay. they are not flexible on hours. it is very hard to get your schedule change because its first comes, first serves. when I hurt my back I ask if I can get volunteer time off and my manager said that he couldn't because than he have to ask every one else but the next day he gave the people that are playing broomball volunteer time off without asking the other employees. also you have to make rate unless you can get fired. but sometimes they will excuse it if there was a reason why."
good,"You scan packages, you learn how to work with alot of different personalities. Managers are nice co-workers are fun getting the product out in reasonalbe time depending how your night starts off. Having fun."
good,Co-workers are very friendly when you can talk to them. This is a very loud work environment due to multiple conveyors running. You are not allowed to take your cell phones into the building which encourages you to get to know your coworkers.
good,"Amazon offers a great benefits package, If you can get past all the drama, favoritism, and lack of concern that they are running you into the ground, its  not a bad place to be. The work is easy but the demands of rate and expectations can sometimes be more than even the best employees can fulfill."
good,Co only hired New Community college grads with no degree in the filed and no experience and no idea to what they were doing.
good,A typical day would be clock in and would have a short stand up meeting and then head to our stations and start counting items within the pods that would come to the station I was assigned. Takes your breaks throughout the day and have another standup meeting after lunch. I work a 10 hour shift from 6pm to 430 am.
good,Amazon is a fast paced environment. Overtime opportunities available in bulk to earn extra cash. A diverse culture and open door policy for addressing issues and management. Long hours per days but more days off- four ten hour days.
good,"At my location I could only work 10 hour shifts. Job was pretty simple. Co-workers were great, lots of cool people."
good,"When i used to work at amazon i learned  how to receive pick tickets from supervisor,reading orders to find out catalogue number, size, colour, and quantity of merchandise,packing and weighing orders,placing incoming items on records,"
good,"en general es una buena empresa, con varios beneficios para los empleados."
good,"it's hard job, however, the environment was healthy, i have learned to work  individually  as well as in team,people there were so coopeartive."
good,"Everyday we go in and do the same thing, the management has no idea what they are doing and give write-ups like candy for the littlest things they can find. I personally would not recommend anyone to work there."
good,"A lot of hard work Expected to work hard, sometimes doing the work of multiple people. A lot of physical lifting and walking required. The expectation to be very flexible."
good,"Working at amazon had its advantages and disadvantages, Targets on everything, Could be a fun place to work but the advances into higher roles were not very easy if you didn't know the right people"
good,"It's a temporary staffing agent, they help you find job that company is often. If there have work they will call you for it"
good,Good place to work at if you are in need of a job. Not what it used to be but it will hopefully get better if they start treating their workers better than they currently do.
good,if you have all day to devote to the company and dont mind working 10-12 hours 4 to 5 days a week great job. hard day at work all day long very few breaks. Managent only cares about things that are on paper and not the impact on employees. Was relaxing at times being alone for a few hours working.
good,"Amazon is an OK workplace. Since I were a picker, my job description required me to do A Lot of walking. The walking, to me, were fine. It only hard part was to keep a certain speed and pick certain number of items each night. If someone didn't get it, then the system will give out write-ups. If 3 write-ups are given, the that person will be terminated. Overall, the pay is great and can help someone to lose weight, I did."
good,"It had a nice comforting feeling of friendliness without being too relaxed, you didn't feel like you were just a cog. The management understood that late shifts can be even more tiresome than early shift, so they were a little more lenient on the bathroom breaks. I became quick friends with my co-workers and with us together, we were unstoppable working machines. The hardest part, personally, was standing for 9 to 10 hours. The most enjoyable part of it was the paycheck and the people."
good,"The hardest part of this job was there was no variety, I enjoy learning and being able to perform different duties on the job. The more variety the better. I really enjoy meeting new people and learning new things."
good,"Security specialist position at Amazon was productive and busy work place a lot of meetings, a lot of customer service was involved for this position."
good,"Managers are terrible and lazy. Spend over half their shift sitting in a break room.  Work isn't too incredibly hard, but can take a toll on your body."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work, however to truly appreciate and benefit from this you need to be directly employed by Amazon and not contracted to deliver services i.e. facilities and security?"
good,"i enjoyed my time at amazon,really enjoyed working there and the people where great.the work was really hard and it was long hours but the wage was really good."
good,"my review is that its a good place to work, good payish I suppose,"
good,"The company is great but they also have some policy restrictions that a representative can't grant to customers, such as if there package isnt delivered in a timely manner we arent able to grant them the full refund for irt. The customers of Amazon are extremely spoiled and they feel as though as a representative we are the post office or ups and we know that we can get there package to them. Then you have to contact management and they cant give you a straight answer and it goes back to the policy on what we can offer. You have to apologize and show empathy and then if its from a third party the waiting process for a customers refund takes two weeks and once again we have to explain the process.  I'm a great agent when it comes to problem solving but when a package isnt delivered this one is pretty tough. I've worked for pretty stressful companies but this one by far has me questioning"
good,"Fun, Hard, Work. Typical days were good. But when you need to know something even HR didn't know simple questions. always pointed you to a call center."
good,"Fun work place. fast pace, the most enjoyable part of the job was working with my colleagues, also managements would put teams together to make work more enjoyable."
good,como todas as outros sempre buscando seu lucro em dependente a qualquer coisa.
good,"This job would be a good start for someone that is just walking into the working world. However, it can be very physically demanding and tiresome after long ours and pulling various amounts of overtime. On the bright side, advancement is an opportunity. And the pay is really good considering it is weekly."
good,it is a great job to get you where you want to go in life they are flexable with work shifts have great  benifits and there management is not there strength in the company they like to promote guys from college that never had hands on experience in the job invirement odd right other than that thats it
good,Overall fairly good company that any individual would enjoy as a temporary position with above average pay not of the typical job.
good,it is what it is poor management. coworker are the best hardest part about the job is dealing with the managers.the most enjoyable part of the job is clocking out
good,Excellent place to work if your young and just out of high school to learn and manage your own time well. Decent pay and incentives to motivate you to make rate. Learn customer skills to make critical pull times for delivery.
good,Job Work/Life Balance sucks. The salary and benefits are good.  The people there are very smart individuals. I learned a lot about managing people while working at Amazon.
good,"I have learned a lot and grown more than I could have ever expected.  Thank you for a great run Amazon. If you go in with the mind set that this is going to be your life while working there, the results for career development are endless."
good,Nice people fun managers never was bored they where always talking about safety better the item get damged then yourself. had very little time to go home with and spend time with my family always felt too tired
good,Day do day site management. I learned about new site build outs and project roll outs .Management was not onsite so i had no . I had a good working relationship with my co workers and tough them everything i know . Working 18 hours a day was tough as i had to commission the site from scratch . Being part of a Global company was very rewarding as i had the opportunity to travel overseas
good,Good money and hard job as I've been working night shifts. Very happy about the overall process of how the warehouse was managed wih so many employes out there. Very high standards of health security as well which made Amazon a really safe place to work.
good,"I worked for Amazon for just under two months. I worked 40 hour weeks 4 days a week. The pay was good, but the work was hard. The management were positive though strict. The job could be stressful due to very precise monitoring of daily duties and high productivity goals. The job was manageable but mind numbingly repetitive and quite isolated."
good,"A fairly simple job as Order picker. quite repetitive but enjoyable at times."
good,Different jobs each day a lot of opportunity possibly available but is very hard to advance to the jobs you would like to apply for it is a process to even get into Amazon so thats an accomplishment in itself.
good,"Amazon is a great company - the growth is amazing. In my role, there is a lot of travel. I interview 200+ people per year! The management is very busy - assignments are ambiguous and you just have to figure it out and carve out your niche."
good,"A typical day at work at amazon starts with a 5 min stretch before any works done. Then, we check the board to find our station and begin working. Work consists of first retrieving a cart full of items, then scanning and packaging items according to size, and finally we tape and attach shipping information for transport. I liked the people and management it was a fun and challenging work which I loved, and the only hard part was leaving."
good,"Another difficult job, sorting orders in a timed fast pace way was very difficult, but enjoyable as well. I would welcome any challenge again"
good,"I enjoyed working at Amazon. It was for a short time due to working nights, and having a two year old. I liked the jod I was given, and it was nice meeting the people there."
good,A lot of Different Opportunities there Very productive constantly working supervisor acknowledge your work and employees work together to help your day go by.
good,"Monitoring and escalating daily trafic ,booking and changing  customers apoitments- Dealing with process and documentation for “in” LTN2 to UK FC’s transfers."
good,Hardest part of the jobs was the hours 10 hour work shifts. Overall fun experience and great people that work there. The managers are very helpful and the employees are very nice.
good,I worked in ONT6 my area manager was great but his PA played so many games it was all about who was sucking up to who. When it comes to HR they were an even bigger joke
good,"This has already been reviewed previously in this application, nothing else to add to this. I have no more to add to this."
good,"i always started my day with a thought that today i will learn new things and show good productivity,our management was good and very helpfull.my co-workers were loving and always keen to help eac  hothers..hardwest part was leaving job and my co-workers,enjoyable moment was luckydraw in best attendence.which i got"
good,"There are different types of jobs at this facility and each one involves different types of skills. I am a picker and I believe this is an excellent job for young people; however, older employees (not all of them) tend to struggle to keep up with the demanding rates. Some of these jobs, such as ICQA are easier and less demanding."
good,well a typical day at work start off with a stand up meeting and checking staffing while that is going on we are strenching.After that you go to your station and begin working. I work on sort side of the department and you would start rebin items into the wall..Your station tells you what location to put it in. The hardest part of the day is probably standing up all day but you can get through it. The most enjoyable part of the day is after lunch beacause you ready to work and it goes by fast
good,was an ok place to work. they do not hvae and understanding that sometimes you have to take off to take your child to the hospital cause theyb are very sick.
good,Vvvery fast paced on your feet 12 hours a day need speed and memory a must minimum breaks did not fit the hourly work culture but fun highly competitiveand challenging job vvery few mistakes and deadline for product pick up a nice place to work for those whom have ambition and drive
good,the management decides on day one whether they like you or not and from then on there is no changing their mind
good,"searching and buying online ordering, now a lot of present for Christmas and new year"
good,Rotina tranquila de trabalho no dia a dia e bom relacionamento com equipe
good,Long hours and disfunctional management. Not enough training for all employees.
good,"I go in at 6:30p.m Sunday-Wednesday get off at 5:15a.m. I have learned to work in steady but fast pace. The managers I work with are cool, and I love my teammates we work as one. The hardest part of the job is the hours, and they have a very bad turnover rate. The best part about the job you get to meet a lot of people, and there is always a job for you."
good,a lot of walking. a lot of standing. but great coworkers. management was not that polite.
good,Very good place to work. learn different - different types of inbuilt tools. Very helpful co-workers.
good,Loved working for this company but the shifts were long which the body has to adjust to but the management is really nice and supportive.
good,"With good guiding principles, smart data-driven decision making, and great compensation/benefits for full-time employees, Amazon can be a fantastic place to work. But the corporate culture of Amazon does not promote a healthy work/life balance, and trying to land a full-time position can be daunting and puzzlingly difficult. Some people will find the hands off, self-directed management style of Amazon refreshing, but poor coordination between different departments and the mishmash of stopgap tools used from team to team can make most projects unnecessarily difficult. Still, working at Amazon can be very rewarding if you're interested in the task and can deal with the ambiguity."
good,You will not be able to keep a life with this job. The breaks are horrible and no matter what after work you will be tired.
good,arrived at work quick drink worked lunch worked breaks i didnt interact much with managers i just gt on with my job it was fun very physical been on feet alot the job wasnt hard at alli always tried to meet my targets n succeeded alot im really shocked i was layed off
good,Allowed the employees to seek free certifications and additional training to help serve the customers.
good,"Currently a picker at Amazon Fulfillment Center. Once you learn the minor details of the job and get use to being on your feet for long periods, the job isn't too difficult. The hard part is making rate. Once you learn the basics, the rate does come. There is cross-training in other departments available. It's good if you are wanting to see what other departments are like in case of transfer opportunities. There is room for advancement within the company and transfer options available. Competition is high within the facilities. Be prepared to work hard."
good,I think over al this company is just fine and well on it's way of hiring and keeping the best employee's.
good,Well I start my day with stand up and exercise.  Then we start Picking product for customers orders.  The walking 17 to 25 miles a day is the hardest.  Everyone I have met have been very nice to work with.  The most enjoyable part is the exercise I get from walking 10hrs a day it has got me in the best shape of my life but still working on that...
good,Was very hot in the building and had to walk every were to get to check many diffent problems all in all very good place to work.
good,the typical day at work would start with the stand up and then everyone grabs their scanner and a cart and go to pick up the order which is placed the line. The hardest part of the job is to work the 15 miles daily routine.
good,amazon isn't a bad place to work. but they could be a little more understanding and patient. they can find things to make our jobs a little easier.
good,"nice place to work and exercise, fun and a lot of incentives to keep you working fast"
good,Amazon true customer obsession company. Work Hard Have Fun Make history is the true headlines that company provides to its employees
good,All in all my job at amazon fulfillment center is not one I have anything negative to say about.  I enjoy the work that I do on a nightly basis. Mostly all the work I do is through different applications on a portable laptop. I make it so that all of the associates can continue in their functions by eliminating problems as they appear.   The most enjoyable part of my job is the feeling of being needed. I know that without me being present everyday there's certain things the associates would not be able to accomplish.
good,"On Month ends,"
good,"Amazon is a warehouse environment that ships, receives, and processes the goods they sell online.  I worked on the Inbound side of Amazon, where product is coming in and being received and processed.  A typical work day at Amazon consists of the following activities: moving and receiving product on a conveyor belt, down-stacking or arranging pallets of products for receiving, stowing individual items or pallets, solving problems with shipping and inventory, and loading or unloading trucks.  I learned how to do the following at Amazon: unload and load trucks, operate various types of machinery, process freight and receive products as pallets and individually, as well as transport and stow freight.  Management was unanimously decided to be Amazon's biggest downfall according to Tier 1 associates.  Management was often hired from outside with no previous knowledge of Amazon and had a hard time understanding the needs of their fellow co-workers.  Communication was the biggest problem, among manager, as well as associates of all levels.  My co-workers on the Tier 1 level were usually great to work with and worked well as a team.  I did not have problems with any co-workers and found most all of them very easy to work with.  My co-workers are what made me enjoy my job at Amazon.  The hardest part of my job at Amazon was dealing with the lack of change and the extreme repetitiveness of the nature of my job duties.  I did not feel challenged enough to focus on my job and often became frustrated by doing the same actions for 40 hours a week, with no opportunities for advancement.  The"
good,Its your typical warehouse job.  Decent pay for what you are asked to do.  Definitely not for those who do want to earn their pay checks.
good,Amazon was a great place to work at. I love training and Amazon gave me a great opportunity to grow in the company.
good,"I learned to work as a team mate, I didn't like that it was a seasonal job. I was a nice paying employment"
good,"A typical work day consists of clocking and then going to ""stand up"" which is where we stretched. Then we would go to our stations and scan packages/products for 10 hours a day. We would get a 15 minute break at 9:30am and at 3:00pm. Our 30 minute lunch would be at 11:45am."
good,this is a job not a career at a level 3 or under. This company doesn't promote from within at that level or below. Un written rules or politics.
good,nice place to work for but too american.the staff and people easy to get on with
good,Repaired Kindles and helped with purchases
good,"At the beginning of each shift every department has a safety meeting, and stretches. After the meeting the crew is dispersed into whatever stations they need to be in. Or into another station for cross training. Warehouse wide standard goals are set for each department and hourly updates are available for review of progress."
good,"Amazon is a very big and warm, busy wearhousee you not alowed to run or nothing like that you can fall and hurt yourself in the wearhouse always tie your hair back and were these safety boots and jackets"
good,"Good staff, fast pace, working hard, feet hurt a lot. I didn't like all the walking that had to be done in the company."
good,work staff like all the time. Long days and hot in summer and cold in the winter.
good,Dedicated to there customer base (check web site for full details).
good,"Travail d’intérimaire à Amazon pour les vacances d'hiver, un travail physiquement fatiguant et répétitif. Être en condition physique pour pourvoir marcher pendant plusieurs heures."
good,the company is ok but the people who run it is they don't care bout nobody bout themselfs they fire you for the stupedstuff ever an don't even gibmce u a second chance
good,"Overall working at Amazon.com can be a fulfilling and rewarding experience. Since it is such a large company however, it varies widely between teams. Some departments tend to be much more competitive in nature and others have a strong team mentality. Fortunately if you find yourself on a team that does not fit your needs, it is easy to transfer within the company."
good,Great place to learn. Great place to get the basics of management.  It's different than most companies that I have ever worked for. Very unique.  Associates are allowed to come and go when they want too just as long as they don't use up all of their time.
good,It was really nice in the beginning but it wasn't as fun when management had there favorites picked. They really try to not have favoritism but some did not all managers only some of them. Overall a good place to work the pays good. Just minor issues.
good,Hard work but good work. Have worked in warehouse jobs for many big companies and they are the cleanest and brightest workplace. Wish I was still working there
good,Very good friendly atmosphere... Makes work life n family blife easy since work from home option is there. Would recommend to join amazon to all my friends n family members.
good,This is a very Physically demanding job. If you are unable to stand for 10+ hours then this is not for you. If you love constant movement and some heavy lifting then you will love this job.
good,Good place to work. Very busy they have good pay.  a typical day at work is working til the work is done and the job is very fast paced. I have learned to faster and more productive.
good,"Every day is similar but aslong as you reach your targets every day it is ok, Good basic pay and decent work hours, The hardest part of the job is walking around for 10 hours a day."
good,"its always first day at work. Its fast paced work life . It all depends on your manager how the work is allotted and completed in time. Given the hectic schedule, work life balance is a challenge"
good,"The job was good, but because of the distance I couldn't manage my monthly bills. I left, just before the salary increased, because I found a different job near my house."
good,Excellent training first class working . Nice people very fast pace.reccomend to young people .food very cheap and good.i don't know what else to say job job yop
good,Satisfactoria pero no llegas a cumplir las expectativas económicas
good,Benifits start the day of hire and they're good benifits. Downfall of working here is changing shifts is extremely hard and 12hr days will wear you out.
good,In my time of being an amazon employee (warehouse associate) was great. I enjoyed growing and learning the different aspects of the position and working stations. I was able to work my way up from a scanner and shipment moving to staging and placing pallets to where they need to be in order to be shipped.  In addition the people I worked with were amazing and very helpful during my time being there.
good,Working for Amazon was okay as far as work load. The manager and some of the company policies are what make the job difficult. The pay is good starting at 15 an hour.
