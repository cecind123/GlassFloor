rating,review
bad,"Management got they head so far up they butt you need a cummalong to pull it out they are contridictive dont care about noone but themselves they hold grudes they ""ALWAYS TRY"" to make you wrong in situations when half the time they are wrong i wouldnt recommend no one dont have nobody die in your family because they gone think your lying this is the worst job I have ever had in my life. Good Day yee yee cant say wat i want but yall get it"
bad,"Terrible company to work for, very inconsistent with write ups, lots of favoritism, and management is terrible. They ask for more and more work and not enough pay. BE AWARE YOU DO NOT WANT TO WORK FOR THIS COMPANY IF YOU ARE NOT ONE OF THE FAVORITES YOU CAN BE GONE IN THE SNAP OF A FINGER, regardless of how good you are at the job."
bad,Absolutley the worst managemment I've seen in my 40+years very age discrimatory   and if you aren't buddying up.to the boss forget about getting anything out of them work conditions are very bad no Hr no IT mandatory it what a s***hole
bad,Man the place is a joke upper management is terrible they have cameras everywhere just to watch you the place is like a prison they tell you one thing and do another they claim to be a family but everyone is expendable as long as it covers their upper management
bad,"Very poorly Managed Facility. The Company was acquired again last year by a good Company, but they havn't got adequate Leadership at this Facility yet."
bad,ASchulman ran you to the ground the front office people were horrible the hr lady took forever getting your hiring papers in if she didn't lost them first and had to start all over with paperwork
bad,"Hurry,Hurry got  to get product out is a typical work day.While it sits there.All about the numbers.If your not a friend or family member you get no advancement and you are nothing.Management we get points like little kids.Workplace culture poor morale.Hardest part of the job no respect.There is nothing enjoyable about working here.Benefits are horrible,and health ins is bad,bad.They need to update equipment. But they want product to produce out the the  door. Higher bonus's for them. While we produce and they sit back.If you want advancement time for a test. While you wait for an answer to take the test and never happens.Hold on will get back back to you and that is never."
bad,"No organization, they don't promote from within , instead the hr lady hires her friends and people she use to sleep with to put in power. This company is a joke."
bad,"Since a. schulman took over ECM plastics, the work environment is horrible. no compensation, very strick and treat workers like robots."
bad,"The pay is terrible , you complain in response they’ll tell u turn in your pay for skillz but they will never sign off on it . But will ask and expect you to go above and beyond and will not pay you for it . Management manipulates and threatens employees. DO NOT info management about any personal business , it will be known by everyone . Management does not follow the handbook and make aagreements that aren’t kept and will. . The pay does not substain the cost of living. And there Lala no overtime . . U will make more money working a gas stations. Don’t waste your time ..  throw you under the bus ."
bad,"Hours and schedule can change daily, even multiple times. Communication is lacking and managers have no knowledge of all department's duties. Lack of respect for all employees, and lack of caring on life/work balance."
bad,"Plant management does sit up front and cuss and talk about the employees constantly behind their backs. They do not follow their ""work place culture"" at all, they will lie to customers and their upper management to hide their screw ups and manipulate numbers. Management pretty much does what they want to there.It does no good to go to the H.R. because they are just as bad.It is just a ""good ole boys club"" when it comes to the plant management. You will get worked with no concern for you or your home life. As long as it doesn't affect them, they don't care.If they don't like you they will target you and retaliate against you.Once that happens you might as well start looking for another job.The turn around there is thru the roof and the head office doesn't seem to see a problem with it. If you fired current management and re-staffed the plant management it wouldn't be a bad company to work for."
bad,"I would have rated this a joke and complete waste of time had it been an option. Worst company ever! "
bad,"Little or Poor Training, Then expected to do things. If a mistake is made Watch Out they want to hang you."
bad,"When I started at a.schulman it was challenging and I had a very truthful, and educated manager in Maintenance. He left for bigger opportunities and the project manager has took over since then. He yells or makes smart comments and is very uneducated, and he lies to save his own self. He has ran most of the good help away. Some of the techs have reached out to HR but it get thrown to the side and doesn't get investigated"
bad,"They will work you to death and then let you go for no reason,if they don’t like you they’ll let you go. The chemicals could literally kill you for 14.50 a hour it’s always 110+ degrees in the factory. You have to wear thick clothing they provide. If you even touch the product your skin will itch for hours on end. Formans are terrible never there to help they want you to work and get out. Would never ever recommend this job to anyone unless you wanna work and have organ failure in 5 years"
bad,There was a good balance between personal freedom and internal structure.  Personal relationships were friendly and non-competitive. Job definitions were clear and unambiguous.  The atmosphere was supportive but efficient.
bad,"This is probably one of the worst places I've worked in the past 10 years. The management says they want want your feedback and help when it comes to new and helpful ideas regarding the workplace, and then when you try to offer a idea they immediately silence you. The benefits are pretty bad compared to other like companies. Would not recommend friends or family to work here until significant changes are made."
bad,"Empresa sem direção e muito fraca em questão de segurança, gestores sem conhecimento em atos operacionais."
bad,no parts and having to work 6 or 7 days a week for no reason when there is no parts to work on poorly run factory. no people to run presses. they cant seem to keep people because they work them to many hours no time for family life. they treat you like your nobody just a number.
bad,"Good overall. I really  have  nothing negative to say about A. Schulman.  Again, I have nothing bad to say about the company.  The employees are really nice."
bad,"Ran by a loosing managing team. The product quality is always receiving customer complaints. Bonuses was not given out year after year due to poor product quality and too many customer complaints. This place was a big waste of time to work at. It's filthy, and doesn't have a leader. The only leader the company did have was the maintenance supervisor and he was smart to leave the company. Most of the maintenance department employees has left because of the manager we have now and the rest are looking. He doesn't treat anyone with respect and blames everyone but him self. The company is up for sale and if it don't sale soon i'm afraid it will shut down because of the management team."
bad,Worked there for 3 years and knew more than most supervisors. You get treated less than even when you do more than your job. Its ran poorly. But benefits are nice.
bad,"Turnover is crazy if management knew how to hire people and actually cared about them it wouldn't be a bad place. I worked there for about a year in the warehouse. Their exit policy said to give a two week notice, I did this and was told not to come back to work. Management is just a group of buddies that are very rude and cuss their employees. They chose an employee for a supervisor job and then argued about who wasn't going to train him. This could be a good place to work but will need a new manager. HR is no help either, HR isn't even at the Bedford location. Maintenance is lazy stuff is breaking down everywhere. But you are expected to run no matter what and if you don't you get chewed out over it. Night shift never sees management so you can't get any questions answered. If you have a choice find another job. This is not a good place to work."
bad,At this point they have an acting plant manager who is not professional or personable at all. The HR department is a joke and very unprofessional. No accommodations are made or considered when it comes to scheduling.
bad,It’s a new company now they were just purchased this year and it is a very stressful environment they are extremely understaff co workers are telling on each other it is a 0 tolerance rate for safety so if you hurt yourself minor or major your gone You don’t even have to hurt anyone or yourself and you gone if and minor infractions with safety is involved
bad,"This company does have good pay but it is not worth the headache you will experience in AP. It is unorganized, management is awful, poor attitudes, no work ethic, no follow up, management will talk about other employees to employees (ex. I was told by our manager to not believe anything this one girl says because she is a liar.) and no accountability. The amount of naming calling from management was astounding. No staff is ever there to work. The amount of crazy things that I saw when I was there; well let's just say I could write a novel.   "
bad,"The interview process consists of:"
bad,"Upper management doesn't understand or communicate with the people who work for them. Hardly room for advancement, low morale. If you're looking for a dead end job this is the place for you. The benefits are OK, healthcare dental 401k... This job is great if you want to clock in, make plastic, and clock out. Alot of good technicians have left recently because of low workplace morale. Temporary workers are in and out daily, so training the same simple jobs to 30 different people is highly likely."
bad,"Managers play favorites, poor pay for amount of responsibilities, do not trust site management- they will throw you under the bus without a second thought."
bad,produce product and dump into boxes or load out to a railcar. they teach us valuable knowledge on all things that go into production processes. management needs improvement good coworkers for the most part hardest part of the job is locating tools to accomplish task and making blends. most enjoyable part of the job is continuous knowledge gaining
bad,"Corporate office is not connected well with this location in Illinois, and communication was poor at best. This location feels very disconnected and like it could be spun off easily."
bad,Terrible long hours. Very hot environment. Very very dirty work place. Management is distant and inconsistent. Training is non existent. Would not advise others to work there.
bad,If they had better management the company would be a good place to work for. I think the people are fed up with management and they don't care anymore  make it hard on the next man that has to pick up the slack.
bad,Upper management micro manages production. New employees get all the perks while employees that have been there get nothing. Shortages in material causes weekends to be scheduled
bad,Plenty of overtime. Good place to begin your work history. Prepare to work 12 hour shifts with about 1 weekend off a month. Work/life balance is poor. No formal training program in place.  Progression and development within the company is entirely up to the individual. The company does not encourage or promote advancement. Good insurance. Company generally shouts down for most holidays.
bad,Needs to improve a lot on its policies and it’s current employees need to be better compensated in all aspects of the company! Can be a great place to work if it gets back to what it can be!
bad,"I'm the only one who can keep 2 units running.  Was told they wont promote me because they don't have anyone who can run the unit as well.  While it's a compliment, I know I will never move up"
bad,There is no work/life balance.  None.  They will work you 12 hours a day for 5 days straight or they work you 10 hour days 7 days straight and every other Sunday off.  You're married? Not anymore! Wife will take 50% of your stuff and leave you if you go here!  Management has a shift manager on first and part of second shift that is a real piece of work.  Do not ask him for anything even if your situation isn't your fault.  Ask the floor manager even if it isn't his job.  He'll set you in the right direction.  Poor payment and the heat is massive.  There isn't any airflow in the factory.
bad,"Es una empresa con buen ambiente de trabajo, donde se puede desarrollar la carrera profesional"
bad,At first I was excited to work there because I started making $15/hour with a $.50 shift differential for second and third shift. After touring the plant and working there for awhile I realized it's very  unpleasant and seems to me even dangerous due to all the dangerous vapors in the air. At my orientation I was told wearing a respirator was a job requirement. Yet they never gave me one in the ten months I was there
bad,I worked at Ferro for 32 years and A Schulmans bought them out. They cared nothing about any of the people working there. They closed the plant after 6 months of buying it . They did not want a union.
bad,Everyone is hands off. There is little or no direction on what has to be done and production employees seem to have more say than management does. Good benefits though.
bad,"Increasingly poorly managed. Associates are being set up to fail, not succeed. Extreme cronyism encouraged. My personal belief is this local experience does not reflect the corporate vision but is allowed to flourish regardless."
bad,"Empresa precisa desenvolver melhor os gestores para auxiliar melhor os profissionais assistidos,  possuem uma boa estrutura."
bad,Coworkers pitch in if they see you need help. Maintenance personnel were great but there was a high turnover rate in maintenance and production line personnel. Lower management was difficult to work for and displayed a superiority complex. Middle management was good but had to support lower management even if they were abrasive and violated safety rules. Production personnel were fired over safety infractions but lower management wasn't punished for violating OSHA standards.
bad,"Work Life balance is zero. A lot of office politics. "
good,I started there before it became a.schulman and went through 5 sells everytime it got new leadership it got worse for the employees on the floor making the company money no advancement opportunity. No raise for almost 3 years before I left can go straight to their competitor down the road and starting pays more than top out pay at A.schulman
good,"Falta oportunidade para crescimento , desigualdade entre funcionários , salário defasado ."
good,"poor management makes work/life balance miserable. the work is physically demanding, but bearable under better management. the expectation for lower level employees is ridiculously high for the amount of pay they offer"
good,Em geral é uma boa empresa. Alguns pontos negativos que fazem muita diferença no dia-a-dia do colaborador.
good,"There were some things i liked about this company but overall it was a bad experience. HR never spelled my name correctly,  i never ran a press here although i had 3 years prior experience and knowledge, favoritism and promotions to associates who had their heads  up managements tails, and hardhats/long sleeves required. Overtime was scheduled although we didnt have sufficient resources to get the job done some days (out of mix,out of inserts, ect.)."
good,Management is horrible. All upper management who sit in the front office cuss and threaten the people on a daily basis.The supervisors on each shift are great and help with the stress. This could be a great place to work if two upper management would be thrown out.
good,"leadership of maintenance department not very strong"
good,"Turnover rate is so extreme that YOU WILL work night shift. Long hours, constantly moving, sometimes stressful, really really hot during the summer. Good benefits, decent management and co-workers. You will top out your salary within two years, which isn't very much. Not a lot of room for promotions."
good,"compression mold, so it is hot."
good,"Empresa com minímas chance de desenvolvimento interno no sentido de crescimento profissional, não prioriza na formação de lideres sucessores."
good,"Working conditions dirty,  work responsibility changed daily. Little inventory to work with, very hard to get supplies."
good,"Decent job with a good amount of physical labor. I think that some of the equipment that we work with could be repaired with greater detail.  The plant is more like a warehouse and not like a typical gas/power plant that I thought it would be like when i first head about the job. Compared to the Chevrons, Goodyear, Exxon and Valero plants the pay is towards the bottom of the pay scale. It feels like we do enough work to be paid as much as the bigger plants but that is simply not the case. The ceiling for advancement seems low at this job. There is not much you can do in they way of moving up in a career."
good,If you are single and can deal with rotation 12s it’s a great place.  It’s a fairly easy job it’s just a pain to get in the hiring process is slow but thorough
good,La empresa tiene colaboradores muy amables en su mayoria.
good,Empresa muito endividada. Gerava muita instabilidade entre funcionários.
good,I was working as a quality engineer in a plant that was in the process of being sold. This made my job more difficult.  This was also a union facility.
good,Ich habe viel gelernt in den letzten 13 Jahren. Vor allem selbständiges Arbeiten und auch vor wirklich schwierigen Situationen nicht zurückzuschrecken. Ich habe an meinem Job  die Vielschichtigkeit geliebt und den Kontakt zu Menschen.
good,"gestione rapporti con altri responsabili di divisione e dei miei collaboratori, ottimizzazione del tempo."
good,"A good place to work if you are up for a challenge. Alot of upsides and alot of downsides. If you like hard and challenging work, here you are. I wish management would hear some people about their issues. Been there for 2 years and I loved what I did. The recent schedule has put me back into finding another job. Work and life balance is thin at times."
good,"If you want a job that you work mandatory Saturdays sometimes even sundays every week and have no social life, this is the job for you, yes it pays okay, pretty good benefits"
good,"Fast pace production.  Pay and benefits are well.  Safe and clean environment."
good,"A.Schulman has been a nice place to work. The people are genuine, polite and respectful. Management has been very reasonable and understanding. The hardest part of the job is properly prioritizing the workload."
good,positive work enviroment good co workers fair benfients offered to employees and attendance bonus usually able to stay busy help offered often easy to get teamwork help
good,"People who work the floor are outstanding. Managers do not know what they are doing and will not approve over time when needed. Overall great company, just awful management."
good,It takes someone a long time for them to get hired in. They would keep you in the same place press everyday. The work was boring and very tiring.
good,"	Professional with 7 years of experience in plastics and rubbers industry. The main functions include: technical analysis laboratory to control properties and release of finished products based on PP, PE, ABS, POM, PA-PS, polymer blends, and others.  Elaboration of Work Instructions based on ISO and ASTM standards, create documentation required in accordance with the standards of each product, approval of suppliers of raw materials as general thermoplastic resins and additives, technical consulting business, sales and technical support after sale, development of new customers, open and appointment of new products and markets."
good,Hay muchos favoritismos y mal ambiente laboral por dicha causa
good,Mandatory overtime is the norm. Prepare to Be short staffed regularly. Dirty job with lots of exposure to many different chemicals and fumes. Many hazardous chemicals used. Training Depends on if the trainer likes you or not. If not you are destined to fail.
good,"I learned alot at this company.  It was ECM Plastics when I started on June 15, 1998.   It was owned by four wonderful gentlemen.  They made you feel like family.  I started out as the Receptionist and then started to learn Accounting duties.  I then was doing Accountant work, mostly extensive data entry and I became the back up to the Receptionist.  Later down the road I started to learn Accounts Payable, taking calls and working with the customers and vendors."
good,"great company, never had any problem with them .  benefits were excellent but they sold the plant and I lost my job because they closed due to the Union"
good,"The hours were very demanding, but the job security was well. They were also very helpful when life issues came about, and they worked with me to try to be as flexible as possible."
good,at typical day at work would be fun i learned how to operate a number of machines that make different things to assemble management was good and fair the hardest part about the job was getting all the work done by the time the shift ended the most enjoyable part of the job was the people i worked with
good,"Good co-workers, good benefits, relaxed atmosphere. Job is fast pace and dirty.  lots of over time.  This company likes to promote from within. Not a bad place to work overall."
good,n/a  I have nothing to say  at this time about the company A. Schulman. So far this company is a great place to work but a big turnover in the production area
good,"Not there long enough to form an opinion,was not my favorite place. The work was good,plenty of it,but I had no experience in plastics,so I was not able to appreciate   the importance of it."
good,I never really got into a normal work environment as our plant was part of an acquisition and was thus slated for closure. The company was very fair with the benefit package provided.
good,Empresa tem uma boa estrutura porém não dá oportunidades de efetivar aprendizes.
good,"Se establecían los planes de trabajo por dia para realizar cursos de capacitación, en las sala de junta el personal no llegaba a tiempo, se realizaban los cursos con excelente participación del personal."
good,Self management of time to complete jobs assined by supervisor.
good,Working here can be both rewarding and frustrating. Company offers good benefit package from day one and pay is in line with what everyone else seems to be offering. The plant is hot during the summer and dusty always so if you don't care for either of those conditions best to take a pass. Co workers were good people and everyone seems to jive most of the time.
good,They were fine to work for the two years I did. Had differences with the management though. It seemed to be the reason of my leaving. They care greatly about your safety on the job. It does go to the border of maybe a little to much goes into it. It does feel like they do have people that don't know the jobs making the rules on them with out looking properly into them.
good,"Aschulman is an enormous company. The compensation and benefit packages are better than average, from my experience the work environment is safe and clean, but can be uncomfortably hot. t"
good,"un día muy dinámico, la experiencia que obtuve durante el tiempo laborado , de la gerencia bien hasta que cambio, del grupo de trabajo uno de los mejores, de lo difícil los rechazos que se llegaron a tener"
good,"I worked there almost 5 years. When it was Prime Colorants and family owned it was a really good place to work. After A.Schulman bought it out, the quality started going down hill and future of the company looked grim."
good,"A. Schulman provides a safe working environment with plenty of day to day challenges that put personal skills to the test. You are able to work independently, and are given ample opportunities to make value added decisions. I thoroughly enjoy the workforce and have made plenty of life long and valuable professional relationships."
good,"Firma war zu groß und gut"
good,Biggest frustration was the ever changing work schedule. Walk into work only to be forced overtime without prior notice. Same with weekend OT.
good,"I have no comments about this company workplace, accept, I had a great supervisor. I only worked at this company temporary and wished I had got hired."
good,It was a great company that helped develop my career. I was promoted twice in 6 years before the company was sold. I worked with a lot of great people.
good,Safety is number 1 before each job you always have to look everything over to make sure you can began to do the job safely if the job can't be preformed safely call supervision or who ever necessary to help make the job safe before starting
good,A.Schulman is a great place for employee involvement.  We practiced self managed work teams that gave the technicians a sense of ownership.  They had a lot of pride in the around the amount of training they provided.
good,"The management staff was supportive and helpful if needed. Hours, benefits and overall job was good. I had way more experience than was necessary for job, so I taught others useful things to apply to the job."
good,Schulman is a decently sized company that is int he process of going from locally managed to globally managed and evolving to a corporation.
good,They taught me a great deal which I was able to transfer into my own personal business.
good,"If there was more room for advancement and more communication between management and employees this would be a great place. There are certain individuals that receive all the work that needs to be done while others skate by. Accomplish goals take to long because of funding or time. Production needs more training and leadership. My maintenance boss encourages the department to move ahead and don't get tied up in the employee negativity, my maintenance lead is very high strung gets mad a lot but willing to learn from his mistakes. The department is changing since LYB purchased the company and if we all could figure out how to help each other out we could have a great team."
good,Interesting place to work. I learnt to work with different people with different backgroung. I learnt to work in a team . The management team was very great.
good,"There's room for improvement in every company and workplace, but A. Schulman does their very best to find and conquer any issue. They are all about  the safety and comfort of their workers. It's a comfortable amd friendly environment and all of the workers are like a family."
good,"When you work at this location, you easily feel like you are working with a family. They truly care about you and your family."
good,Valeu a pena trabalhar nesta organização. Ótimo ambiente.
good,I am glad A. Schulman bought Citadel. I see good things from A. Schulman in the future for the companies and employees they acquired.
good,Great place to work in a lab and your giving complete freedom to go above and what is exepcted of yourself.
good,"El día empieza con reuniones en piso para analizar y solucionar problemas en el piso y llevarse compromisos de solución"
good,"lack of training ,good place to work, its cold in winter hot in summer very dirty  .  it a good old boys club . if you are in that you are good . a yes man you have to be to move up"

good,"A. Schulman gave me the opportunity to practice my transition management skills. I loved travelling all over Europe with Schulman, and I am glad I met there some of my very good friend"
good,"My manager was let go my last few weeks there.  Every other department there seemed fun to work in.  Great company to work for, just my manager was terrible and not liked by her employees."
good,"Good place to work. Keeps you busy, at times there is opportunity for a overtime. Face pace work involved. Usually start as a temporary employee, with good work ethic opportunity to advance."
good,"Empresa em desenvolvimento, encerrou suas atividades em São Paulo transferindo-se para Sumaré."
good,"The work atmosphere is very upbeat! They reward employees for being over achievers and going above and beyond. Also they are always giving out free-bees to everyone, example: coolers and jackets."
good,Inspiration and motivational Job I think A.Schulman was a good job I look into working for them again and become a better performance on the job. Also get back in school to become a smarter person to help others become great learners and start of better and finish my job in correct matters.
good,Very good company not perfect but very good. You where paid a vey good wage. Training was good and precise. I really enjoyed my time at A.Schulman and was very hurt when they decided to close our plant down.
good,"Great job to get started , the job isn’t hard . Work hard and you’ll learn a lot . The management isn’t hard on you & the workers are great people . Cleaning is a big factor"
good,Worked for Schulman back in 2000 - 2002  Solid company that has continued to grow.  I would highly recommend talent people to review this company.  Strong treasury team

good,"while working at A.SCHULMAN I Learned a lot,I didn't do just one job.cleaning restrooms,gathering cardboard and pallets,outside cleaning,cutting trees,painting, one good thing me and all the employees got alone good,we had BBQ together"
good,"Era muito corrido porem chegamos a um bom resultado no final. Aprendi q todos juntos como equipe poderíamos crescer mais."
good,Received excellent training. Wonderful people and work atmosphere. The people there were very kind and always ready to assist. Had a very good experience overall.
good,I liked my job here.  I learned a lot of new job skills that helped me in my next job role at Mickey Thompson.  It was a very good learning experience to work here.  My skills became more diversified.
good,"L'évolution dans un environnement international (US, EMEA, Asie) requiert la maîtrise de l'anglais."

good,"Everyone at aschulman are not just employee , we all are like family and everyone gets along well. I love coming to work for this company , i can see the growth in this company."
good,A. Schulman is awesome but has been recently acquired by another company. Many of the positions could be listed as redundant and eliminated. ASI was a great company to work for while it lasted
good,Really good place to work people were friendly and everyone pitched. Left A Schulman to move to with family in North Carolina.. The hardest part of my job was making boxing to package products in. I've worked some pretty tough jobs and this by far was the easiest
good,Great pay good people fair wages and the flexibility and understanding to have a family life. We were the leading plant in inventory control and production.
good,"Multilocational, US based, NASDAQ listed company with good work culture focusing more on safety, saving & smart sales."
good,"Never a dull moment, exciting. "
