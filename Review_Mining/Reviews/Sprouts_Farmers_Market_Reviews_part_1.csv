bad,Dont work here. Run. If you want to wear awful green shirts with bad vegetable puns that will make you feel like you've lost your self respect than go for it. Managers are mostly a miss. God forbid if they're a moron because they will sink the ship and the other 3 managers will help them do it. You will have no support from core 4 or HR. This company makes my skin crawl. I feel like i have no rights or voice. All in the name of healthy living right? You're just a body. Nothing  more nothing less.
bad,"I was excited to work for a company that was very forward thinking. They recycle, they compost, trying for zero waste, boy was I wrong! They throw everything away. They have buckets for recycling but they are not used. "
bad,Bad company. They grossly understaffed and underpaying employees.promise pay n promoted and dont deliver.is a very fake company on thier mission statement.they do not train anyone properly
bad,Sprouts treats there employees very poorly. They are not unionized so treat there employees not so well and put employees in unfair situations. In addition to this I feel like they have not updated the way they run there stores since there doors first opened and the supervising store managers are always atrocious and don't know the proper way to run a store and they run around like chickens without a head.
bad,I’ve never been treated so poorly as a human being. I despise this place  they take your related work experience and cut it in half so I had 7 years cashier exp they paid me as if I had 3 years. They don’t value cashiers I guess.. everyone is miserable and hates it there... management is shovenistic on all fronts. It’s a #METOO place to work if that’s what your into. HR didn’t do anything.
bad,Was a horrible work environment. Every one that worked there was very unhappy. Another manager from one of the other stores came in and tormented everyone for a few months until most people quit
bad,The deli department manager don’t care bout his employees at all. The workers work there butt off and don’t even get a thank you. The deli manager walks around all day likes he’s working and don’t even come and help his employees.He have upper management fool like he is such a good hard Dependable worker  when 80% of the he’s gone for hours. They claim to hire within FIRST but they don’t . How you expect your employees too care when the Department manager don’t care
bad,I worked for this company thinking i was getting 23 hours week to only get 2 days week 4 hours a piece basically 8 hours for whole week a waist of time i have 4 kids and they expect for me to live off 8 hours week and the manager gabe is very racist towards his employees very nasty attitude just made working for the company even worst nothing good to say about my experience glendale 51st perioa location never work for this one
bad,"Stay far away from this company. As a vitamin clerk I did enjoy the perks of selling supplements and talking with reps, getting free samples of product. But the management here is horrible, the store could have a much better team if they didn't treat their employees the way they do. This company has a really high turnover rate and the store was always short staffed. Hours were cut constantly and in order to get a full work week I'd have to volunteer to push carts or sack groceries."
bad,"Sprouts is the worst ran company I have ever seen. No work life balance, no support from management, no corporate support and no respect from anyone. Sprouts management will just use you with no regard. The corporate staff is just a bunch of bullies who soul job is to make your job harder. Dont waste your time at sprouts"
bad,"Very bad company to work for.Bad environment to work, poor management. Lack of respect, integrity and no ability to flourish. Do not recommend to anyone."
bad,"They come from Arizona to open stores in our cities, bring shovels to bury the underappreciated store openers. They will limit your hours to insure you can't get the good benefits, and there will not be any sort of consistent training. Watch how they impute average hours worked, dont work a 4 hour shift in a week, it'll cripple your chances of benefits."
bad,"slave labor,never enough help they cannot and will not retain talent for lack of compensation,they have let people walk away over ,50 cents,good people for some sort of ego company bull,i was making ggood money but got totally burnt out where it effected mt health i made a choice my health or money i left and took a lower paying job next door !!!!"
bad,The store has no maintenance person to fix anything and the store don't get clean as it should .deli dept is dirty and they don't wash there machines or other equipment either.mole growing underneath the salad bar .
bad,Was working part time due to other job all of a sudden I’m forced to quit because management would not accommodate my  hours anymore after several months but it’s being done for others  I feel I was discriminated against
bad,"Got thrown into the dairy department with the promise of more hours , at first there were hours but now I’m lucky to get 20 hours a week , management are clueless and totally out of touch with reality , great place to work if you truly enjoy being treated like a worthless slave laborer ."
bad,"They like to cut your hours around the holidays (even managers who are guaranteed 40 hrs a week) so the store manager can get a nice little check in his pocket end of the year. Over hire. Blatant disrespect. Rules constantly changing. Make you constantly feel like you can never do enough with how little you are paid and always strive for unrealistic perfection. All this company cares about is money, you are nothing to them and they let that be known."
bad,"i worked at Sprouts for 6 years at the same location.  I can't say the problems I observed in that store are pervasive throughout the company, but my experience there indicated the management simply did't know what they were doing.  Beyond being generally unpleasant, the management informed us that seniority held no value.  They have cut hours to the degree many people have quit.  For some time we had a competent manager and the store thrived. Lately, I have  to wonder if the company intends to close that store."
bad,"Manager was very dry ,,, felt like would not be fun working there because he was very serious. Never ones smile or try to make a joke . Also ask me question about  how would I handle situations. I awnser him . Again never said good or nice job . I don’t know how he is a manager . Again very dry . He seems very micro management like he would keep watching you at all times . This manager as soon he ask me how much I was looking to make he cut me off because i said $16 . He is a moron"
bad,"Terrible place to work. management only care about their bonuses and don’t care or appreciate their workers , one raise  per year . Company always short handed not enough cashiers  , they expect cashiers to work only 8 to 16 hrs. Per week not."
bad,Poor Management. Poor Human Resource Personnel. No Communication. No Training. Totally Unorganized. Bookkeepers show favoritism to certain employee's attendance and corrective action. By far the worst Company I ever worked for.
bad,Management plays favorites in this department.  Bulling by co workers so stressful that it took a toll on my health as I was working full time hours asked to be cut to part time and uper management refused thus I did not work for a month because I needed a doctor's clearence to return back to full time because part time was not good enough.  They do not respect people at all
bad,"Management does not care about issues employees have. Human Resources does nothing with the complaints. Favoritisms,Discrimination, Retaliation,Lying."
bad,"Management is terrible, you get paid little to nothing. Elder co-workers constantly harass you all the time even when you are the hardest worker there. I filled in several other spots outside of my job and was never given any gratitude or appreciation. Takes too long for promotion and health care benefits are terrible. If you call out sick one day the manager will cut back your hours for weeks out of spite. DO NOT work for Sprouts!"
bad,"Worse place I've ever worked for.  Management thinks only of themselves, & they play favorites.  Store manager that is there right now is horrible. Has no idea what she is doing. Very poor training, then they get mad at you because you don't know how to do something.  They don't care about their employees, it's all about sales, sales, sales.   So glad that I'm out of that dump.  Please....do not work there."
bad,"absolutely terrible, management sucks and they don’t care about your well being. they claim to have an open door policy but they really don’t care. you will definitely get harassed, you will definitely want to quit eventually, courtesy clerk position gets abused by management and front department"
bad,One of the worst companies I’ve ever worked for. They cut hours really badly around the holidays. I don’t work enough hours a week to pay my bills anymore
bad,"Worst.Job.Ever.I always did my best although the paid wasn't great,most coworkers were lazy and management wasn't very professional.But Sprouts showed its worst when a department manager(who everybody said was a drug addict) hit me with an electric pallet jack and nobody did anything.Store manager supported him instead of supporting me,the victim in this case.Tried calling their HR Support Hotline,didn't do much better.They said they took action but didn't say what they suppossedly did.In conclusion,you can literally get killed there and no one in management will care or will do anything about it."
bad,I have been trained in 5 different departments with the plane to advance to a management position. Discussed this with the main manager. Over the months in this training I never received a raise of any kind and felt used because I was able to shift readily to each position.
bad,"No communication "
bad,"Sprouts is a terrible company to work for. The pay is low and management is terrible. After 2 years I was given a ,13 cent raise. I would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"This company is horrible to work for.When you get first hired they tell you about how much they are about you,how important you are,and how much we are the backbone of the company.(Total lie).The hours change and ignore schedule request completely.Managers feel like they are better than you no matter what.They are ignorant and extra as heck.Since there are about 10 different managers working in a shift they all feel like they can tell you what to do even if you are doing something already.And if you do not do what they say right away , you are no consider lazy and not putting your part. Dont even ask for help cause asking for help is hopeless. The main store manager is lazy and just walks around talking to other managers about personal topics.But then floor managers go to the back and talk trash about each other and the company all the time.Very unprofessional."
bad,Not caring about the People that do the legwork for minimum wage.Anyone can sit in their office all day pushing a pencil and make more then ten employees do in a year. They treat others terribly and get a great yearly compenthe WORKERS get a raise once a year average twenty cents not even notable. Managment  only cares about their salary don’t be fooled corporate walks in with too many directives and attitude...
bad,This jobs tell you that you will be full time that’s not true and the store manager is racist I will never suggest any one work there and as long as that lady is the store manager this place will fail
bad,I was looking for promotion however I felt very uncomfortable working for Sprouts no opportunity no advancement pick and choose who they wanted in those position improper training the deli was totally mismanaged  inventory was totally done incorrectly lose alot ofprofit
bad,Do not work for this company. Racist and do jot promote a lot of blacks.i did not agree or like the environment or the way they treated the employees or teammates
bad,Store manager is inconsistent and has no etiquette when speaking to other employees. Store manager also refuses to address the stores' fly infestation. Worst location ever.
bad,Sprouts is a horrible company to work for. Management micro manages everything and write people up for things out of team members control. I was full time but there were team members getting 8 hours a week how are people supposed to live on those hours thats why good team members leave. I was a head cashier and we never had enough cashiers the lines were always so long not because we were that busy but because we were that under staffed. Management solution was to ring faster not call people in. Just a horrible overall experience.
bad,"Right away I can see that managers are not professional. They want you to have an open availability just to give you 4 hour shifts. It took two weeks alone just to get hours on the schedule alone. And it took another 3 weeks to be officially on the schedule. Not at any point I saw anyone that was happy to be there. Almost every department is always short, but they don't want to give you the hours to help. Even the general manger doesn't look at her employees in there eyes unless you are her friend. Last are all the health code violations through the company. Saw tons of product that have spilled under shelves on the floor but never cleaned up for days. Mold was growing on the shelves. Also cleaning chemicals are stored next to back stock in the back. Do not work here is my point!!!!"
bad,The culture is brown nosing and backstabbing.The B.S. is so thick u need boots just to walk through the door.Oh did i mention no working toilets! You never catch up because they give u more to do in a short amount of time.Dept.is short staffed and more part timers than full time.When u have a day off u come back and its worse than when u left.
bad,the inter view was great ..but since day one it was trouble ...bulling by coworkers and management...hr will not do anything because they have to have at least 3 or more to be able to maybe admit there maybe could be a problem..
bad,"No even able to pay rent with what they pay you here .. some have to have second job , many  have to look for another job to make it .... look for better job and where they have your back"
bad,Bad company to work for. Store mananger is a horrible man. He is hateful rude to his employees... There were some good managers... There needs to be more action taken .
bad,"I tried to apply , interview and work here."
bad,"I work bakery department and I had to Stock bread place label on muffins change date on bread discard over dated, cut slices of bread for customer bake."
bad,"Lied to me from the first interview until I left. Promised on position.  Told me it would be a week until promotion.  Then another week,  then another,  and so on"
bad,"I feel treating your employees fairly, results in productive employees. Management should be willing to work as hard as their team. Keyword Teamwork!!!"
bad,"Came in as FT but received 27 hrs a week. No advancement because they hire out of store and most people they hire have no experience. Management does no training nor do they care about your life. Harassment verbally by management and workers constantly. If you have worked for another grocery store it will be come obvious in the first month that this company is unprofessional.  They expect you to do others jobs and if not they make your life miserable. So if you have coworkers that do nothing they expect you to do their job and yours. The lazy, harassing employees and ones that never show up are never fired. The best part is Don’t expect more than a 35 cent raise yearly while management receives bonuses throughout the year."
bad,Some managers were great but overall everyone wanted to quit because they don't follow the days you asked off. They make you work in departments that you are not getting paid for and expect you to do it on the daily. I worked there for a year and I got paid 9.92 and that was with my .18 cent raise with a good score on my yearly review when you move to a different department they call it a ladderal pay and give you more work and expect you to still stay as a cashier
bad,"Whatever I did I was  put out down ."
bad,"Employee's are disposable to this company.  Lowest pay possible, all so the manager can make his bonus and cut the employees hours.  No full time here.  They just sting you along."
bad,Once we did the Grand opening and all the corporate office people left everything went down hill after the transfer of management. They not only decided that other people had rights to be Bullies but it wasn't ok that I stood up for myself. I do not recommend this particular store deli to anyone
bad,"I have been working part time at Sprouts over 2 years. They barely keep enough help to cover shifts, but when you are working they drive you to get so much work out of you for the little they pay. "
bad,I work at the sprouts in southlake Texas. They are so CHEAP after being there for. a year I got a 11 cent raise what am I going to do with 11 cent. Raise ??? Sprouts is so cheap I wouid.not  send my cat to work there. The hour.s are bad 130 to 10 pm hour.s stink. Some of the people are good workers. Most of management only care about them self and money they get. Sprouts is the type of company. That pats it.s mangers on the back. Especally the district manger.s he.s a jerk   so don't work there only if you are desperate for a job.not all. The mamger s are bad. Spouts mamger s only care about them self and that's it
bad,"Poor management! Ridiculous expections !  4 hour shifts, comunication is non exsistant, no training...and I can go on!!   Miss representation. Don't waste your time here!"
bad,The manager got fired for being a bigot towards me. Worst place I’ve ever worked. Couldn’t pay me to go back. They manipulate and abuse their employees. They’re “legally” allowed to cut you down to four hours a week. They tried to bribe me with discounts to work extra deli shifts for them even though I was starkly underpaid compared to the other deli employees. This place is two shakes from a lawsuit. Hope it gets shut down soon.
bad,"Believe me when I say this company treats their employees very poorly! Worst communication and scheduling issues I have ever experienced anywhere. You will never know your schedule in advance, you will get it the week of and it will constantly change so you have to check daily. You can not even plan your life. I worked at their competitors and was treated way better. All of the bad reviews on here are  accurate! Managers do not show you even a sliver of respect and show their anger and immaturity  on the floor. It was the most hostile work place I have ever worked.  "
bad,Poor work environment and very hostile within management and lower division employees. Nothing gets done when asked and head management will stick up for one another when others are clearly doing wrong. Often given the run around about scheduling and problems that occur in the workplace.
bad,"Horrible store management. "
bad,Worked for sprouts for 5 years long story short they only pay there store directors good there they spoil the customer's and treat us like slaves  in the last 3 years all my raises together adds up to 65 cents and thats with excellent reviews all in all if you join this company your looking at 20 cent raises each YEAR WOW do yourself a favor and apply for a UNION COMPANY don't waste your time like i did
bad,No real meat cutters exists in the company. No one knows how to work to company standards since there are none. Most managers show personal issues at the work place.
bad,"They don’t respect the employees. Management talks down on their crew, they don’t accept criticism and will take an employees hours away if they find any reason to not like them."
bad,"I don't have enough bad things to say about Sprouts to put in this review. Not even two days(yes, I said days) into training, my co-workers took every opportunity they could to ridicule and insult me. The staff at my store is particularly hostile, unfriendly, and unprofessional, and management is incompetent and unorganized. I'm ashamed to work there."
bad,This was one of the worst work environments I’ve ever worked at. The bosses treat their employees horribly. They are not flexible what so ever. They could care less about you as a person. They are not organized and lack managing skills. I would never recommend to anyone to work at the Mill Creek sprouts. I worked there for almost a year and it was a waste of my time.
bad,They hire only people who they can make give less than 20 hours a week  for poverty level wages.  No place to make a living only good for retired people and college students.  Don't work there if you think you can make a living.
bad,"There isn't much to expect when starting a retail job and I was thrilled to be taken on within my interview until I realized they really do this with anyone. Further down the road of employment there I connected further dots when I would see new faces weekly. A company HAS to run top down otherwise there will be no incentive and low morale. Management at Sprouts is severely lacking in work ethics. From my experience, it was a bunch of middle aged people who, from how they gossiped and picked on lower staff, seem to have nothing else really going on (or for them for that matter) so they act like a bunch of vultures and prey internally instead of doing their jobs. I can't even list off the amount of times you'd catch management huddled in the office cackling about something rather than helping staff and customers on the floor. Oh and training is just being hired. Worst few months of my life and the mental and emotional strain that comes with this job is NOT worth it."
bad,Offer a job and was told I was paid to much got cut 2 three hours a week and I gave two weeks they ask me to stay they didn’t appreciate me I moved on
bad,"This place was a nightmare. Upper management did anything they wanted all the time and anyone could get away with not doing work. If you had even a little bit of a work ethic, you get to do everyone's job."
bad,The store has cut down hours twice now since opening. A lot of people quit in their first month of business due to no training. They were expected to be fast and do a lot with little to no training. A couple department managers quit as well like Bakery. It's not uncommon to be scheduled for only 5 hour shifts. The only plus side to working at Sprouts is that u get paid each week.
bad,"The grossest ( food safety and health) , the dirtiest , most unethical,  malicious,  unorganized,  immature management,  bunch of idiots I've ever worked for in my life!! Hr is a joke as well!!! I've got pictures of how they store their food overnight and during the work day....wanna see??!!! Its just the worst place!!"
bad,"Bad management and bad training.  Did not consider the employee, only what was best for the company. Would not recommend working for Sprouts in any capacity not a good culture just saying"
bad,"Working at Sprouts Farmer's Market was the worst place I've ever worked. The people I worked with were so bossy and there was so much drama. The customers were even worse, they were rude, condescending, and snooty. They didn't care about me or anyone else. I left this company because of all the anxiety and depression it caused me."
bad,"Deli Mgr,  (who had only been deli mgr.  for two weeks was extremely verbally abusive  Mgr. did nothing.  I would not work there in the future if you paid me!!! ."
bad,"They posted the position and Snag-a- job did the initial phone screen and  set up an interview. They have you go to meet management at the store for a 1/2 hour interview. They promise that someone will contact you & then give you a phoney bomber to call, if you don't hear something over the next several days. They ignore you forever & care not about treating people with dignity."
bad,"Poor inept management, very low pay for the grocery industry.  Never enough labor scheduled always understaffed.  Will require you to work off the clock if you are a manager; even though this is against company policies"
bad,Managers see you as nothing but machines .. you are a number in their system that is it. I had a family member die while I was on the clock an the manager who responded to the phone call for me to receive the information told my family I'm busy to call back later. I also tore a muscle in my ankle while at work an I was told to put ice on it an finish my shift.  I was accused of being on drugs because I use the restroom alot.. I'm a female an need to change femininity products often.
bad,Working at sprouts Farmers market is a stressful job because of all the hard labor and the time frames given to do the work. Also the management to be a hit-or-miss on whether they're good or not
bad,"I worked there for three months, called out sick one day and there was a miss communication and I was marked as a no call no show which wasn't the case. I ended up getting 6 points and got fired for it! I couldn't even live on what they were paying me. I was the only courtesy clerk on my shift and only worked 4 hour shifts and was lucky to work 3 days a week it was usually only two! My manager always got someone  else to tell me something."
bad,Not appreciate and mean they need to treat people better and pay better it’s a lot of work and pressure I do not recommend anyone to work here at all and not giving much hours out and hiring people still what a joke
bad,Stressful place to work. The favoritism and discrimination at this company is very open and overlooked. Management hires and promote friends and friends of family. It is not a diverse place to work. The pay is at the lowest and there is no advancement. This is just overall a horrible place to work. The worse experience in my life.
bad,"The management does not care at all. Hours are inconsistent and constantly cut. Management does not resolve any problems, people who worked hard do not get anything while those that barely work get promoted. Supposed to get a raise every year but management usually finds a way around it."
bad,They promote people who really aren't ready for their positions causing a lot of issues. The pay rates are supposedly based on experience however a lot of people with more experience get paid less (especially if they are women). The needs of the department and the company come before the needs of the employee.
bad,"Management will grow you under the bus every time they screw up to cover themselves. You will work as low as 5 hours a week for big chunks of the year due to them constantly cutting labor. People are promoted who don’t deserve it all the time. And, I mean it. Get ready to have an 18 year old who has only been there for a few months be your manager as soon as they buddy up to management. There are no positives at all. It’s a total trash job and everyone who works there hates it."
bad,"Just horrible, would not recommend. The customers are rude, entitled, and racist, with the occasional nice one. The managers pretend to care about you, but don't. There's a point system, and it doesn't pertain to their favorites or store managers. 12 points and you're done, but there are people there who have like 60? They will hire anyone. They will work you like a slave, but don't want to promote you."
bad,Regional managers and most of your Administrative Coordinators are husband and wife.Store managers bring in friends and old employees from previous jobs and make them managers.If you want out of a position they wont let you do it.
bad,This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for..especially the management..absolutely pathetic..run by a very immature 7th grader who has no life skills..no leadership and a just a terrible people person.I would not recommend working here.
bad,No way to move up doing work above your pay gradw and not get paid for it manegers are not the brightest and if you call out just once you might as well quit
bad,"Over worked and unappreciated. You could give them the moon and they still would not give you more hours, no matter how good you get at your job. They also do not treat people with disabilities well at all."
bad,"This was my first official job and this Arizona/Southern California based company just opened in the South Bay in 2010. The company is incredibly unorganized, compensated employees below the CA state minimum wage rates, and sold low quality food. They provided plenty of hours and helped me pay for my Community College units."
bad,Managers and employees quit left and right. Schedules all over the place. Managers don’t really care for employees health. Pay wasn’t the greatest either.
bad,"I have worked at literally every grocery store and am very familiar with the industry but have never worked in such a poorly managed store. I was offered a department supervisor position but even with my experience was offered barely minimum wage. Due to me having a baby I had to take anything that I could get. Right from the beginning, there were several red flags for me. When I started I was told that I would be doing a full production job instead of supervisor which would have been fine accept once I started there are only 2-3 hours before the department and store managers get there and once they do I am asked to also set up the salad bar cook chickens cook turkeys and have the department 100% by the time the store opens!!! somehow they expect everyone to do the jobs of 2-3 people with little to no training!!! the store manager comes in grumpy then instead of treating the team members like human beings she completely ignores anyone that isn't a manager! The store management has completely unreasonable expectations of everyone and the assistant store managers have no idea how to do anything in the deli so asking them anything is worthless(that is if you ever see them!) The deli department manager is insanely lazy and immature it's clear she doesn't know what she's doing at all! The deli manager badmouths everyone including her two assistants and works to pin them against each other! She will talk bad about one of her assistants all morning then when he comes in she acts happy to see him not voicing a single thing she spent hours complaining about!  The deli assistant managers"
bad,I truly disliked working there. They did not follow through with the agreed amount of hours that was discussed at the time of my interview. They did not respect the employees. I did enjoy working with the customers very sweet kind people
bad,"This place makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  They hired me!  Great!  Orientation ... girl was opinionated as heck given she’s telling us not to have an opinion. Goes on and on about how nice we have to be to everyone while sounding like she hates the world.  They cram you in to a small space and she tries to play videos on a laptop screen but it keeps freezing up and complaining about it.  Manager is having phone conversations and other meetings during the training in the room. Show up for computer “training” but they don’t ever let you finish.  They put you on a random one or two day a week schedule.  You show up for your first shift and they say work!  That’s it!  There is no training. If you have questions?  Forget it!  If you don’t understand something?  Good luck trying to figure it out.  You are expected to know everything immediately.  If you need help, they treat you like you are stupid.  Management?  Oh!  The people wearing different colored shirts?  Yeah, don’t bother them.  Miserable.  Everyone there is unhappy and yet we continue to work here.  Why?"
bad,Would be a fantastic place but management from top to bottom is a joke. I wasted a year and a half tbere. HR will notify the management who complains about them and it creates a hostile work environment.
bad,First of it started of nice got some good hours. Then out of no where they only gave me one or two days of work. And the thing that bug is they only call you when they need you or  when someone calls out. I really didn’t like that . Overall some employees there were alright . Management wise was horrible . There’s always people quitting due to cutting hours. And all the managers and supervisor all they do is open. They never close and leave the new people to become the automatic closers.  The list goes on . But overall don’t recommend it . Unless you really like only working one or two days .
bad,Indeed sprouts don't pay you 10.93 dollars and hour that's not true I work in sprouts deli and they don't pay you that and the supervisor cuts your hours out if they don't like you or if they're discriminating you get more  points and no hour's and I make  only 10.80 and hour it's not enough to make a living or to pay bills so what ever you have listed well its false advertisement you don't get paid 10.93 I've been there for gonna be 6 months in deli nothing but get treated really bad
bad,I would not recommend working at sprouts to anyone. It took them forever to do my background check. When I did get hired there management was incompetent and ineffective. It took them forever to make my weekly schedule. No one ever really trained me how to do the job. I was there more the six months in that time more then 20 people quite. Would recommend they make some serious changing to how they run there stores.
bad,"All I wanted was out of my position.Couldn't do that .But the new manager was placing all his buddies in a positions that I could have had. The AC went back and told her husband everything I told her. He was our regional. If you want favoritism come to sprouts, If you want a position write a letter."
bad,"Management is not helpful.  They rule with an iron fist and make it a very hostile work environment.  The management doesn't teach, they berate you..."
bad,Currently been at sprouts for 11 months. They expect you to learn all these codes all while under paying you.They keep track of your speed score.Training was horrible it was sink or swim. Couldn’t walk away for two seconds to get a breather head cashiers are constantly sending people to your lane or they’ll question where you’re going. Can’t even take a sip of water without a customer coming into your lane. Customers are entitled and feel that it’s all about them. Courtesy clerks are busy in other departments so you need to bag while ringing up while customers just watch you and critique you how to bag their stuff. High turn over rate they hire people who don’t show up or people stop showing up. Since I started ten people have left in the front end alone. The only thing I like is the weekly pay.
bad,"If you are looking for any kind of personal satisfaction or fulfillment look elsewhere. This is only a temporary JOB, anyone who makes this permanent employment will become resentful they did.  You are just a number here and can be replaced at any time the managment is super horrible  they don't now what they are doing and they never fix any problem at all and they make  1000s of mistake ? and the employees get the blame .the manager have favoritisms i promise you will never ever get the hours if you get lucky you will get 15 hours a week  and don't expect to get a raise that's why you see a lot of people quitting .dont buy the chicken is not organic and is over price sams and cosco has it for 4.99 and much better .dont believe there promise"
bad,No one at the sprouts in junction will care about you unless you sell your soul to them. Mangers make it obvious who their favorite employees are.....
bad,Do not do not do NOT ever work here unless you want to be with a terrible company who does not care about you. I spent almost 3 years there. 3 long years. Management all the way to the top is an absolute joke.
bad,"I hated working here. So much. If I could give it zero stars I would. Management would give us backbreaking loads of work and expect it done in under an hour. Management was rude, didn't care about their employees, etc. Honestly, I only worked here because my parents kept bugging me to get a job and kept saying, ""Sprouts is hiring."" Biggest. Mistake. Of my LIFE."
bad,"Was with the company for over a year. No raise, was told my multiple managers our store manager underpaid everyone when our store first opened. They told us they don’t hire outside the company for management but someone from Publix came in and took over what was supposed to me my full time position. Management lies and has no issue doing so. Also the pay isn’t enough even with the 15% discount. I was unable to use my discount regularly, only IF I got extra hours to have extra money. Do not work for Sprouts."
bad,Store in Peachtree city is the worst store I have ever worked for.  The store mgrs were very unprofessional. The deli department had food safety issues. The store allowed drug use. The store smelled like marijuana daily.  Managers dating employees.  Sprouts didnt offer any training in regards to mgrs and senior deli clerks. The seniors are look at as mgrs but aren't knowledgeable enough about the job.  You can walk in off the street and be hired as a mgr. Alot of human resource issues at this store. If you are going to apply for a position at this store please re think it. Also u are not guaranteed hours. Even as a mgr. Avg hrs 33-37 a week. U only get 40hrs if u are in the in crowd.
bad,"My role was assistant store manager and it was a terrible experience.  Although I loved my employees and they loved me back, the store conditions/company support was awful.  The store manager had no backbone, scheduling was such that nobody ever had a weekend off.  And of course, they only completed the schedule on Fridays, for the following week.  You couldn't plan anything in your life due to not knowing in advance when you would be working.  They would also schedule people to work late shifts and then come in the following day for the early shift!  And this would be actual ""scheduled"" shifts; not emergency/last minute changes!  In addition, Sprouts has mold problems in their dairy and produce coolers. And because they get ""seconds"" of produce, ie. they get the hand-me-downs of produce from the larger grocery chains, the fruit and vegetables mold very quickly. That's why you can buy a cheap pkg of strawberries and the very next day it is moldy on your kitchen counter.  Sprouts has inadequate room for refrigerated storage.  Plus the produce is generally on the verge of being bad/moldy when it enters their back rooms. The older stores don't have enough cold storage on the floor to accommodate the increase in shelving requirements (pressure from newly constructed store layouts) and this means ambient temperature displays when certain produce should have cool display.  Employees exposed to the mold had running noses, watery and itchy eyes and were sick and missed work more than any other company I've ever worked for. Sprouts wages are also very low and don't even come close to"
bad,I got cuss out by all staff member for a whole year! No one got fired. When I hit my breaking point and quit. They tried to tell me I couldnt quit until my shift was over. They tried it! I still walked out the door and regret nothing.
bad,"They don't appreciate a hard worker when they see one. All they care about is who sucks up the most and the color of your skin and it better not be black. They pick and choose who they want to give hours to, totally unethical and very disrespectful to a person trying to pay rent."
bad,"Terrible management very little pay treated employees like they aren't valued especially young employees , the location I worked at was one of the busiest sprouts and tiring and the managers don't recognize the hard work, effort or help you would try to give"
bad,"Sprout's is a complete mess. This company does not know how to run a grocery store at all. I had prior experience in one of the major's, I kept hearing "" We'll transfer you as a cashier after the first month."" Never happened. Management needs work and is a complete mess. "
bad,"Do not work here ever. Terrible Management. They do not care about your well being, and the managers spend most of their time socializing and get angry for no reason."
bad,Worse experience ever. At first it was going great slowly but surely company was going down change I’m management and corporate management. I was a manager for the grocery department worse desicion I made schedule was so inconsistent I would close open and do graveyard shifts.
bad,"This is probably the worst place I've ever worked, like it's worse than amazon. They have a stupid inventory system where they just put whatever they have in whatever box they have. So whenever you are stocking the shelves and open a box of mayonnaise, it could be mayo or it could be crackers (which it's usually not mayo). Next, they make you climb up in the back with little to no safety rails so you could fall from about 20 feet and get seriously injured. They also pick on the new people and will write new people up for anything, even if you are doing better than your other co-workers as they usually slack off while you do all the work. Also, remember how I talked about bad inventory; yeah they over order things that don't need to go out which leads to having 50 boxes of the same chip flavor, taking up the little shelf room you actually have in the back. AVOID THIS JOB AT ALL COSTS!"
bad,Management will hire any person willing to except the cheapest wage. They put people in positions that have no idea what they are doing. If you are full time you will never work 40 hours. You will never work an 8 hour shift in a day.
bad,"They need to investigate these managers I quit and they never have given me my last pay they put some of it on a card and put my birthdate in wrong on purpose so I won't get paid my last days worth of work. They didn't even include my unused vacation pay that everyone gets when they leave this awful place. They hired two people to replace all the hard work I was doing, but said at the time that I was to do it all. Liars. Good luck winning Irish Soda Bread Contest I did it alone one year. I got nothing for it. Worked my butt off. So you would look good. How does it feel sitting up there, management. I hope all of you fail at all your endeavors you don't deserve the pay nor job titles you have. You should be investigated I told HR and they are just covering for you."
bad,"poor management.no training,to much work for little money.Very disrespectful management.Management does not care about the employee's.The hardest part of the job is dealing with disrespectful manager's."
bad,tipicle day work hard 8 + hr a day you do not lean much managemnte is bad work culture work till you clill over work life blaice worst yeR OF MY LIFE do no work here
bad,"Managers there treat everyone unfair. All the hard workers get abused while the slackers get to do do whatever they want. There is no ""Action"" to stop the growing issues. No one cares managers just sit in there office and screw around while we all suffer."
bad,I would never go back bad bad bad. Low pay and want things done that two people should be doing they give it to one . Place opened over half the store left. No no. No
bad,Not a good a place to work. No organization and poor management. No ability to move up. Very bad personal experience as I was to be the  overnight Manager but never revieved the title or the raise. I never even received my managers shirts.
bad,This company is a joke to work for!! The management of this company couldn't even get me a work schedule after the first 3 days of employment and I went up to every level of management to get it and was told by the store manager to get the heck out of the store and don't come back but when I attempted to file for unemployment they told the State of Kansas that I quit on them what a bunch of lying scum bags!!
bad,"Management is horrible, scheduling is horrible, don’t hire enough employees so it puts stress on everyone else. In close to 3 years working for the company I have received maybe .50 cents towards a raise. And I have worked many different departments for them and have never complained or anything. Got passed up for a promotion for an employee that doesn’t have as much experience or knows what they are they doing."
bad,They have a lack of respect for the employees that have working for them and they don't have many options to move up in the company. The management doesn't communicate very well to the employees and they don't act on employee problems
bad,"Probably one of the worst places I've ever worked at."
bad,I've been working for sprouts for almost 2 years . I have seen a lot of people hired but I've seen more people leave. People get jobs to have money and the support their families.hours was 37 and a half a week and then they take it down to 10 hours a week and expect you to be happy and work happy. how can you live on $10 a week when you have a mortgage or car payments or electric bills or etc.and no I wouldn't recommend this store to nobody because they promise you everything and they don't delivery nothing.you can even get hurt at work and was called and guess what they won't even pay for it real nice people are worried about themselves and how many other stores they can open up and just take advantage of people so yeah shame on you sprouts
bad,"Worst corporation I’ve ever worked for. The pay is mediocre and the hours are a joke."
bad,"If you value yourself as a person of integrity, or at all, then do all that you can to NOT get a job at this business. Corporate management does not care about its employees and has set up a program that lies about it. They do not value anything but their current stock price and are only looking to sell the business to the highest bidder. They hire cubicle people to make decisions that have never worked in one of their stores and have no clue as to what the real world is. "
bad,Horrible horrible management. There are tons of employees that have been working there for more than a year already and they are still getting paid minimum wage and the management love to talk bad behind people’s back. Working at a warehouse is way better than working here
bad,Worked as a deli prep clerk and it was miserable. No matter how much you worked it wasn't enough for management. They refused to change my hours to be able to attend school.
bad,this place treats you like a slave and does not care about you. they wouldnt let me go to my grandpa's funeral with the threat of termination. every week the schedule is different and you only get two days before next weeks schedule is available.
bad,At first they said you could get up to 40 hours and after they opened up they gave us 2 days only. A lot of us had to look for other jobs. The job was okay but not enough hours.
bad,poor management. no team work. all attitude no help. poor vibes. if someone wants to help this store come out of its hole and start working correctly go for it. not for me
bad,Management  was poor wouldn't come back this morning is stressful management don't care lot of department managers don't last the only good thing was leaving this job
bad,Thy work is very hard and very demanding and the management will treat you like a slave and put you in the freezer working most of the shift so they don't
bad,"They don't care about the individual, they will cut hours take you off the schedule at their convenience. They expect to to be dependable but they're not a dependable employer."
bad,"Unfortunately, sprouts farmers market has so much potential, however, because of poor leadership, and follow through, the company struggles to hang on to good people. It is a sad place to work"
bad,"Working here was horrible. As a Veteran, I made it clear that before coming in, I had prior engagements such as certain appointments that I was not allowed to miss. The first management I had was perfectly fine with this, but when I got new management I was being scheduled over appointments I had marked on the calendar on the Store directors desk and on the online schedule. I also was granted a vacation towards Christmas time from a Sunday to a Tuesday (9 days total) and my manager scheduled me to come into work on my last day of vacation saying that my vacation was over at 10 am that Tuesday morning. I was vacationing 4 states away seeing family for the holiday and there was no way that I could drive back on the Tuesday, the day after Christmas. It was a horrible work environment and while holding a Manager position myself, I was often demeaned for being hard and pushing those under me to work. Everyone at Sprouts was lazy, and I would not recommend anyone ever working for that company."
bad,Sucks on a daily. Management is terrible and I am pretty sure that we as a company are rated like 6th worst place to work in the country according to whatever most recent report in jobs.
bad,"I worked at the Point Loma store in San Diego, California. Store Manager was abusive, harsh and not friendly at all. Constantly threatened to fire me for not working fast enough lifting heavy bags of oats. Employees constantly called out sick and if you didn't answer your phone to come in to cover shifts, they would get upset with you. Turnover is so high, its like a revolving door. Not a good company to consider a career.  Lots of favoritism. Management keeps who they like and fire who they don't like when it comes to lunch violations. IF YOU SEE A JOB FAIR AT SPROUTS...RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN!!!"
bad,"so i am the current assistant manager and sprouts is not place anyone wants to work because. they over work you. they expect you or one person to get a job done that requires 5 people or less but still.. they never have hours for the departments and they blame it on the projected sale that we missed... well how can we make sales with out the people to get the work down. people find bad produce and product all the time. the workers are stressed and i highly dont recomend a job at sprouts ever dont even shop there, they have the worst produce ever. trust me iv been with the company for 3 years DONT SHOP OR WORK AT SPROUTS EVER!!!!!!!"
bad,"HORRIBLE PAY, poverty level,  pay is biased,  favoritism, lack of support from team members, many call ins/no shows, increased work load with no help, high expectations with no increase in pay, bullying, cliques....."
bad,"Sprouts offers a weekly paycheck and so they schedule an employee up to 9 days in a row and because of the pay cycle, we would get no overtime. It was pretty ridiculous."
bad,"Before I became a manager at Sprouts I loved working for the company, once I joined management the situation completely changed. The expectations of management was unattainable. Corporate was always creating new programs with little to no training for managers. The moral of the store team was horrible and the store managers were poor leaders."
bad,Not happy with direction with the company. When I started they were the 3rd best company to work for. Now they are the 6th worst. They have restructured upper management and demoted everyone
bad,I worked here for a summer job. It was horrible. Management would get mad at you lots of things like not being fast enough and being nice to customers. They literally wanted to brainwash the corporate culture into your head. Also one of the head cashiers would treat everyone poorly. If you want to be treated like a slave then work here. Otherwise stay away.
bad,The management changed all the time. I opened the store that had four managers and by the time I had quit they had gone through 10 different managers.
bad,I was given alot of hours and then after that my hours were cut drastically. Besides this I was never told that I was doing a good job but instead was always told negative stuff to me all the time. This was upsetting to me because I am a good employee who works hard and all of my jobs I have had I have never been treated this way and for me to be treated this way was unacceptable.  As a result of the way I was being treated I left this company.  Management needs to be trained on how to treat their employees well.  And for the amount of work that is expected the pay should equal that. I do not recommend this place to work at all.
bad,"I truly did not enjoy working here, I was constantly stressed out, all the time. I received little support from the upper management and was left to be blamed for there faults as manager on duty when they were on vacation"
bad,"There are lots of  turn overs for this company. If you are a lazy person and have connection this is a place for you.Otherwise do not waste your time and effort here. The managements consider you as a machine not a human. Their facade is good but it is ugly inside. The benefits are useless and raises are ridiculous. The only thing which store managers care about is their  large benefits and bonus. They cut employees hours more and more. As an example one of the managers ( in sprouts in las vegas) asked one of employees (who has to com to work by taking buses ) to clock out and go home after 10 minutes of starting (clock in).The working condition is very unhealthy. In summer, there is a stinking smell which comes from trashcan in back room and enters to the break room. Not mentioning lots of flies who come to your face during eating lunch. There is not enough chairs to seat on while eating lunch. The other day one of girls had to seat down on the floor near trash can and eat her lunch. And this is supposed to be one of the best sprouts' store in las vegas."
bad,"I have been working for this company for almost a year, the managers don't know how to treat the employees, they have a high turn over rate. Don't no one want to work for this company. It is very high stress. And if you have medical problems or children or a life outside of work then this is not the place for you.  I would never come work for them again."
bad,"coworkers were nice, but that's it. management will work you to death, like making you work closing shift and have you open the next day . turnover rate is crazy high. basically id stay away, there is way better out there."
bad,"So each department is given a set amount of hours. The manager for each department sets your schedule. It was all about favoritism. The store manager was a fraud, he is strict and demands you to be perfect. "
bad,"I love working with my co-workers. However, I found the management to be rather irrational, condescending and unhelpful. For example, I told a bagger I could not help her bag groceries for a couple of our customers because I was in the process of scanning in and typing in their purchases. This bagger ended up walking away from bagging right in front of our customers. The customers complained to me and told me they had never experienced that level of rudeness at a grocery store in their lives. I apologized sincerely, repeatedly. They told me that I was okay, and assured me that they had no problem with me. I told them they could talk to my manager about this issue. They complained, and later I was told that I was wrong by the management for telling the bagger I could not help her bag at the moment. As far as I could tell, the bagger was not penalized in any significant way, except for some admonishment from the management."
bad,"Unfortunately, as bad as I wanted this company to be my ""new home"" it didn't work out like that. The management was awful in the specific department I was working for. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work for this company. They don't pay enough for the tasks they ask from you. Not only that, from first hand experience they don't train you correctly. They expected me to just know what I was doing."
bad,"Sprouts is a nice place to work, the management that ran the store on the other hand never wanted to help work with you if you had a issue with scheduling."
bad,"At first I enjoyed my job, but as managers changed, which they did quite often, it became more and more stressful.  The hours were all over the place."
bad,The hard workers get little reward the lazy workers get to milk the clock call in constantly with no recourse for their actions lack of respect from co-workers and upper management
bad,"Wholefoods and Amazon are actually beating Sprouts Farmer's market with excellent customer service, benefits, great pay and management. Sprouts  always write up their employees instead of better training.  Extremely short break, no time to eat.  Poor treatment of employees."
bad,The managers are awful. They only look into their own point of view instead of us workers. The communication between the managers and the employees was definitely lacking. I would even recommend sprouts to my worst enemy.  Worst work experience EVER!!!
bad,"I thought that the General Manager was rude, totally unavailable and a bully.  He always appeared mad and was not at all approchable.  "
bad,The worst company i have worked for to date. Horrid management and awful hours. Had to fight for every hour i got and just really was an awful experience.
bad,my advise to you is that if your gonna work here you need to set your mind that is only part time and you will never get benefits because that is a fact i worked here for 10 months and never have they offer me anything at all management is horrible. the only good thing is the discounts thats it the rest is just horrible!!!!!!!!
bad,"A very negative environment due to pressure from management on hours, pay and turnover. Nepotism and interpersonal relationships played a big role in hiring and firing practices."
bad,"At first you think the company is a great company until you walk into a store and realize you have walked into a nightmare of a job... employees are really nice but as to the management you have favoritism the you have bulling and harassing those that break there backs to do a good job day in and day out but it doesn't matter how much you bust you butt its never good enough and once they decide they don't like you, you will find you self out the door fired"
bad,"Horrible  place to work, reviews once a year you will get maximum of 20 cents a year and that;s a good review to sprouts. Zero recognition for hard work,  There is no training program for any position you will be just thrown in the deep end. Managers show no care for job. Work environment is horrible here you will hate it here after a month."
bad,"if you're willing to carry your entire department, this place is for you. Worked at both the independent and corporate Sprouts and I have to say, the only thing they are consistent about is being inconsistent. Be prepared to be thrown under the bus and upper management taking all the credit. Avoid Deli, Meat and Grocery. They have a high turnover rate in those departments due to incompetent management and unrealistic expectations. Managers disapper for hours, never helping out their department. Hours are based on sales so do not rely on this job for full-time hours."
bad,Lots of micro-managing and nit picking from management.  lots of bums and homeless people around the store.  lots of theft and stealing from the homeless. they take away all the shopping carts.
bad,"Management understaffs, drops tremendous workloads on you, takes credit for it and stretches you out to different departments without training and they are very clique-y and of a superiority complex over everyone else. Bad attitudes toward the people that work under them. This is the only job I've had where the management and some coworkers were far more of a hassle to deal with than the customers. They don't care about you and they're not as community oriented as they portray themselves to be. Wouldn't recommend working here."
bad,Not a good place to work Horrible regional and corporate team that is useless.Salary raises are pathetic. The most enjoyable part of working there was with the employees.
bad,Sprouts is a bad company to work for. they do not care about there employees the moral is low. management is very close to none. everyone gets away with everything
bad,Do not work here it is not wotrt it run as fast as you can before they lie cheat and steal from you because they will I promise you that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,This company will turn on you like a rabid dog. The Human resources department  will break felony laws and not care. If you are on the in its great but once your on the out your done. If this company stays open I will be amazed.
bad,This Company is not employee friendly and the working environment is extremely stressful due to stpre culture and environment.  I was supposed to get a 1 year review but was denied because I took another position within the store.  I was told that my new anniversary date will be the date I took the new position within the store.  This was very disappointing as I took new position because of family issues.  I wanted a more suitable schedule due to having an autistic teenager who needed me to have a better schedule.
bad,My experience with Sprouts Farmers Market went from BAD to WORSE. This is All I can say about the time I worked my tail off for these imperialistically brood of nobodies!
bad,Cashiering job that allowed for work in other areas of the company and cross training. Flexible schedules and an opportunity to advance into management if you're motivated to do so.
bad,I would NOT work here if I had a better job opportunity out there.Management cares about themselves too much. The store is busy and I hardly get any hours because they hire to many people.
bad,"Sprouts only cares for their bonus checks. They cut long time employees hours during the holidays. They kept a store manager employed who fires department heads for fun, he cares only about himself. Horrible place to work."
bad,management was horrible very cutthroat and backstabbing they expected alot more than they were willing to pay there employees for and if you get hurt they dont want you to report it
bad,"This company is still growing but management is very unorganized. Mostly there is no accountably for any wrong doing, and there is no initial training.$"
bad,"New employees are treated with a lot of disrespect by both managers and veteran employees. Complaints of harassment fall on deaf ears, and communication between managers and employees is flawed."
bad,Terrible place to work for. They dont care about their employees. I worked for over 1 year in the Deli department and most of the people kept quoting. They constantly cut your hours. The job is stressful and very demanding. Sprouts is a work experience that I would like to forget. By far the worst place I have ever worked at.
bad,"sprouts in bakersfield, CA was terrible, did not feel welcome by coworkers, i was hired for a completely different position than i applied for, i had over 5+ years experience as cashier and they put me to cleaning toilets, no one did not welcome or talk to me. my schedule was always wrong because i had school at night, management is poor, no communication,"
bad,"Management has no respect.. They never keep there word, empty and broken promises. Hard wokers never get any recognition. This was the worst job every,."
bad,"Most employees are hired as part-time only. Stand on your feet for 8 hours a day, bend and lift grocery items throughout the day.  Employees are unhappy and exhausted, and underpaid.  Breaks are given for lunch only, 1/2 hour unpaid.  Employees leave Sprouts disgusted and worse, with injuries.  Excessive standing with no breaks impacts the body very negatively."
bad,Terrible Experience Working For Sprouts...Equipment Needed To Perform Job Either Not Available Or Not Functional...No Support From Corporate Or Regional Or Store Management To Maintain Department Standards
bad,This is the worst company to work for. The management team treats you bad. They scream at you and expect you to do more work than physically capable. Thier approach to teaching you is throwing you in and if you do not do it right they write you up. The benifits are not that good. They over work you and under pay you. They cut hours to make budgets for bonuses but get upset if there are not enough people to work because they cut everyones hours.
bad,"It was awful working here. I never got breaks, felt way over worked. rarely was able to take a lunch. The management team had no hand in any development of the team members, and there is tons of favoritism"
bad,when they hire you they tell you youre working a certain department and you end up working somewhere else people are lazy and you gotta pick up their slack and they promise hours and theyre never there dont work here!
bad,"Great pay rate, just no hours and too much favoritism. Management sucks at getting tasks done properly. Good luck on getting your breaks. Training new associates could use some major improvement as well for ALL positions!"
bad,Management takes advantage of you. Schedules are released 2-3 days before work week. Worked in the deli & we were without water (health code violation
bad,"this company changed my life for the worst. I worked here for over three years. I got hurt on the job. Then I get fired. They leaked our personal information in 2016, and haven't done a thing for us since 1 year after the incident. I almost quite literally broke my back for this store and got fired for it in the long run."
bad,"Typical day at work is walking into the mess from the closer. That has to be cleaned before I can start my job. I learned that you have to train yourself, no one is going to train you, you are on your own. Management is biased and has their favorites. Hardest part of the job is knowing I am being taken advantage of, but cant do anything about it. The most enjoyable part of the job is my customers. They bring a smile to my face!"
bad,these people do not care about their employees. they are selfish and take as much as they can with little in return. they hire young managers with no experience so they don't have to pay much for management. i am very disappointed.
bad,"At the start everything was fine, but then everything went down hill. Associates in my department were stealing time and not doing their job properly coming in on their off days unapproved and taking other days off instead. After informing store management of these wrong doings, nothing happened. People that are unfit for promotion get promoted due to favoritism and the store management can just disregard the policies that the company set up. The store management is a joke, corporate management for the GA region is an even bigger joke. Sprouts or for the one I worked at, cant seem to get it together."
bad,"The particular store in which I was working had major contradictions between its corporate influences and ""cultural"" policies. This led to inconsistency in expectations and a general sense of disarray among employees and management. Nice place to shop, horrible place to work. new-hires based on acceptance of pay-scale rather than ability. In turn, apathy was rampant with close to zero accountability all the way up the ladder."
bad,"One of the worst work experiences I have ever been through. I have worked at many retail stores in the Salt Lake Valley and Sprouts Farmers Market in down town is poorly managed, understaffed and the employees are underpaid. The store itself is run down and should be closed for remodel to meet the needs of the customers. The volume of customers that store receives is to large for the building itself. The company needs to upgrade that location to meets that demands and to improve work moral."
bad,"She is mean and hateful, she has to being sleeping with someone. I can;t live on 10 hours a week. I had 25 hours a week until she came to my store. I loved working for Spouts and tried to transfer, but she would help me."
bad,It was great when I first opened. Mgmt team lazy. Expect you to do the job of three people at same time. Don't want to give staff breaks so they can work short handed. No advancement opportunities. Lots of favoritism to certain staff. If they don't like you they schedule you one six hours day to make you quit.
bad,"After working for this company for an extended period of time, things went downhill.  Management favoritism, cut hours to unlivable wages, multiple HR issues with specific managers, the most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers."
bad,I worked for this company for just under a year. The management of this company is inept to be nice. Their management style is to micromanage to the point you can not properly do your job. They will leave departments understaffed for months on end. The turnover rate at this company is extremely high due to no one wanting to be treated like second rate employee. There is also no loyalty between upper management and the rest of the store. Upper management only cares about themselves and their numbers and have no problem throwing their employees under the bus. They will also not promote from within the store or company and will look to outside candidates to fulfill their department manager and lead positions.
bad,They are an okay company to work for if you dont have a family. They dont really give you a decent raise after wsiting a whole year to get it. They dont listen to your opinion or try to do anything about it.
bad,"Poor work atmosphere, unfriendly management, little to no benefits for employees, unorganized. I had to work harder than my own clerks to not recieve any praise or approval. Always felt like i was pushed 5 steps back at every turn."
bad,"Change in CEO in August of 2015 changed the culture in the organization to one where employees felt valued and proud to one where team members work in fear.  Cost cutting by eliminating roles means people work very very long hours, with little appreciation.  Poor benefits, vacation policy and below market pay make this a bad place to work."
bad,Working at sprouts I didn't think that I could ever get so stressed out. This place does not respect you or treat you well. They don't care about your well being.
bad,I would get harassed by the managers to move my line faster while they did nothing besides go outside and smoke they need more registers
bad,"If I could give sprouts zero stars, I would. I have never worked in a place with so little organization and so much unnecessary chaos. Management cares very little about the well being of employees, for example, a pregnant cashier who was in a car accident suffered a concussion was harassed by our store manager until she came in for her shift."
bad,I got fired behind some bullshi* with another employee stealing. Rather then firing him I was the 1 who got fried for not telling on them. Sprouts is a full of shi*.!!!!
bad,"I personally dislike the atmosphere of Sprouts. When I go into work, I know no matter what I do I will be yelled at. Whether I do an amazing job or not, I'll get the same treatment. I do the work of three or four people and never once get acknowledged, nor do I ever get any help from management. Sprouts is extremely understaffed, and the customers are the ones who get burned because of this. It's not a FUN or ENJOYABLE place to work, and I think work should be (at least a little bit) fun."
bad,Save yourself the time. Apply somewhere else. ANYWHERE ELSE!! The morale at this store is slightly higher than the morale at a diamond mine in Sierra Leone. Employees are told not to divulge information to regional management/trainers or else retaliation will occur. VERY high turnover rate. An employee can't even confide in Human Resources without management being told what you said verbatim. This is a perfect job for anyone who enjoys humiliation and degradation on a daily basis.
bad,"they do not take care of their employees such as disabilities,  I had to have a surgical procedure and they refused to let me go out on disability even though I gave plenty of notice then after over a month the finally realized I had surgery and sent me home for over 3 months without pay,  I took them to the EEOC for back pay and they fired me,  not a good company to work for."
bad,benefits were only for full time employees but they didnt offer many hours. they pay was not good either & they were looking for reasons to fire you if you werent apart of a certain group.
bad,"I worked for Sprouts for a very short time almost 2 years ago. As I was there for almost 3 months as an Asst deli manager I saw a lot of things that know one ever should. In the time I was there, I was written up on my first day of work. For insubordination. I was asked to bring a small set number of cheese cubes out and I brought out 1 more that was needed. For that I was written up. My boss told me that she didn't want the company to hire me b/c she wanted the company to hire a friend of hers for my position.  "
bad,"Sprouts lets people who attend their job fairs and hiring events think they are being hired full time when they are not. Beware: all employees except management are really only hired at part time. That is like most other retail stores today but for some reason Sprouts feels the need to lie to applicants at their job fairs and say they do hire full time and they let their applicants walk out of their job fairs thinking they have been hired at full time and it is all a scam. Why they can't be honest like all the other stores and just hire part timers and temps to open their new stores and not make people think they hire at full time I don't know. I guess they think people won't work for them if they are only part time with no benefits and they are probably right about that for some people because Sprouts also expects new hires/employees to drive all over to train and to even do new hire paper work and orientation. I had to go to Atlanta to fill out paperwork (in addition to what I did online and at the job fair), I had to go to Dunwoody for orientation, and to Norcross for training which I could not make due to no gas money and bad tires. It was all just a big waste of time, effort, and money because not only was I not full time they let me think I was full time the whole time I was worrying about how the heck to get to Norcross, GA to train even though I was hired for the Peachtree City, GA store. They have no concern for the hardship they place on employees and no conscience about lying and saying they are hiring you full time when they are really only hiring you part time."
bad,"at first I loved working for Sprouts, everyone was nice. Out of nowhere the head of the store pulled me into his office one day just to tell me how I'm not working hard enough, which I understood, it was my first month I could have worked harder. a few more months had passed and I know I was working as hard as possible, and helping as much as I could. The head took time to come tell me how terrible I was to my face and how I ""reminded him of all the worst things in life."" I have had it at that point because you don't treat an employee like that. he was saying things like that to other employee's as well. after a few weeks of that, I decided to leave, I couldn't handle the stress."
bad,"the company organization is poor; no training, unorganized, unprofessional management , higher management yells at their employees in front of customers, and I feel like there is not enough rewards for their employees only punishment or write ups."
bad,"At the time of hire, the director who hired me talked about increases in pay, advancement opportunities, vacation accumulation, amongst other things that would happen. After 1 year of service, there were no pay increases as the store didn't generate enough revenue to accommodate. Due to constant changing of management, advancement was very hard to come by. Advancement was promised by one, but not followed through by another. After 1 full year, I had only accumulated 3 days of paid vacation time when I was told at time of hire I would accumulate 2 weeks of paid vacation after the first year. Store morale was always down as we kept changing store directors. There was zero consistency. As soon as we got used to one director, he/she was replaced with another. As of our first year being open we had already been on our 4th store director. The management team had a ""do it our way or else"" mentality. There was no teamwork. There was no helping anyone else out."
bad,When i worked at sprouts i was there to open the store in the town i lived in. Sprouts food and produce was good i liked what they had. Management was not that great when i worked there a lot of problems. I guess that comes with having a new store.
bad,"They are the worst Sprouts to work at in Tucson, AZ. The managers do not care about employee issues. They talk negatively about you with other employees. No advancement within the store unless you are kissing the store managers butt."
bad,A typical day at work and management and hardest part of the job is the most enjoyable part of the job. What else can one say.
bad,"hired on as a stocker, pretty easy except you're also required to run around like a monkey doing other people's jobs too. the managers, basically Whole Foods defectors, specialize in running employees mentally, physically and emotionally into the ground. this store gets corporate visits repeatedly which sends the store staff into a stressfest. you will be promoted without a raise, and when you inquire about a raise, you are given the ""I'll get back to you on that"" line or ""I myself haven't gotten a raise in years!!"" Its a darn grocery store people! You think they were curing cancer in there with all their intense training programs, how to stock, how to face, how to build displays..really ridiculous. The managers get all the credit and all the money..the starting pay is a joke. DO NOT apply here..it's dead end all the way around."
bad,I am not happy with store management. They keep employees from moving to different departments within store due to not wanting to train new employees to fill your position.
bad,It was busy and hectic i learned all kinds of produce codes management was not so nice co workers was great and friendly. Hardest part of the job is when we were so busy keeping up and customers happy. Most enjoyable was breaks lunches and going home.
bad,"The managers are rude. I was personally called an extra and that they don't have money to spend on people who don't know how to do their job. The bakery manager would tell me I am doing well in my progress but tell the general manager that i was doing terrible. Before I was hired, I informed the managers that I was in school and my availability. People quit and the managers are upset because I am in school and cannot work a closing shift due to school. So in turn, they cut my hours completely. Now I only work 1-2 days a week. If you want to get treated unfairly....This is the place to work."
bad,"I will never again work for Sprouts, and I do my very best to stay out of one as well. The Store director of where I was was rude, condesending, and doesn't work with anyone. They want you at there beckon call and be able to drop what you are doing for them."
bad,"Quite literally the worst job I have ever had.  The Sprouts I worked at couldn't care less about its employees.  They would tell you what you needed to hear to keep you happy, but they never once delivered on anything they said they would do.  I worked in the deli.  I have worked in several other delis for other grocery store chains, and the deli at Sprouts is a joke.  Not to mention, I was a  deli manager and they hired me as a deli clerk.  Why did I take the job you asked?  Because management promised me that I would be moved up within 6 months.  They lied.  Also, you could be on your death bed, and they would expect you to come in sick.  Umm...I worked in the deli.  How gross is that??  If you didn't come in, you would get a ""point"", if you were a little late, you would get a point, if you looked at them wrong, you would get a point.  They have lost plenty of good people because of points.  I worked there for nine months.  In the nine months I was there, all of the original people that were in the deli when I got hired, left.  There is a major disconnect between the vision that the corporate office has, and what actually happens on store management level.  Not to mention, the pay is a joke.  I could go on and on, but I won't."
bad,"Turnover, Turnover, Turnover.  Horrible pay, Horrible hours, Horrible management, rude stuck up high class (so they think) customers. Meat and produce that spoils after 2-3 days. More Chiefs than Engines which 90% of them have absolutely no business in the business. Just a god forsaken place to be employed unless you are 12 and don't know any better."
bad,"Uncleanliness of stores, expired merchandise on shelves, no communication amongst staff.  NO BENEFITS except for merchandise discounts, if its not expired of course."
bad,bad place bad management bad pay. didnt like anything about the place.
bad,"The only good thing about this company is the product!! Management will do ANYTHING to get one fired even if there is no reasoning behind it. The store director actually tells the dep managers to FIND a reason to write their employees up. My step-father was actually fired for here-say. Nothing in his investigation was even proven. The assistant store manager set my step-father up to get fired. Simply shows that the higher up management favors people. The scanning coordinator is sooooooo lazy. I had to fix her mistakes & NOTHING was done except having a ""meeting"" over issues that happened at least 4 different times within a 2 week period. I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"I think the management is very unprofessional, rude, and the employees lack training.  I just started and I am not happy with working in my current department.  I haven't been trained to well.  They tell you to ask questions about the job description, but working with managers that call you names is not professional and uncomfortable, even if they call you names and they are just kidding.  oh yea, the pay sucks, the only perk is being paid every week for your hard work."
bad,I liked my job for the type of work I was doing. What made the job difficult was poor and unprofessional management. Too Power hungry with the title of there position. They make you feel unimportant and feel like down. Sprouts is about money not caring for there employees.
bad,"I have never worked at a more poorly run company that when hired you are promised a higher pay with more hours. Upon receiving my first paycheck it was 1.50 less than promised and half the hours. Management blatantly lied when confronted "
bad,"Corporation is becoming bigger, and treating their employees with less and less respect. Management is horrible, the only way to move up in the company is if you know someone."
bad,"I worked for Sprouts immediately after my parting of ways with Henry's Marketplace. At the time Henry's was owned by the now out of business Wild Oats, Sprouts was owned by one of the Boney sons. I thought a return to working for the Boneys would be a godsend, how wrong I was. "
bad,i wasted 5 months here to be litterly YELLED at 2 inches infront of my face from the head cashier. always told i was a horrible cashier because i wasnt upto their standards. they DO NOT have a open door policy. they dont care about their employees... no wonder people hate this store!
bad,This was by far the most horrible job I've ever had in my life. The management team sucked sooooo bad. There was never accountability what so ever.
bad,my work experience  with sprouts farmers markets  was the worst place of employment  employee are not taken care of  there
bad,Setup wet rack then be harassed by management everyday who would apply new rules of tghere own to try to write me up when tghey had noyhing.
bad,"I was a cashier and with this company for almost a year. I was 18 when I was an employee of Sprouts Farmers Market (Culver City, CA). Other than my co workers I hated that place! The managers were okay until one day I came into work and counted my register before I started a customer came up to my line while I was counting I explained to her that I wasn't open just yet I had to finish counting my register she said okay and jumped back in the other line. After I got finished counting I came from behind my register and asked if I could help the next person in line which remind you all her items are now on the conveyor belt and about to get rung up by my co worker. She gets upset because I took the next customer that didn't have her items on the conveyor belt yet.(which is Sprouts Policy) The customer yelled and screamed at me because I didn't take her. So she asked for my manager to complain I call him over and he doesn't stand up for me support me or sprouts policy he might as well not have came over! Talk about embarrassing! PLUS ANOTHER THING I HATE ABOUT WORKING THERE IS AT THE END OF YOUR SHIFT YOU GO TO A BACK ROOM WITH CAMRAS WITH A MANAGER AND THEY COUNT YOU DOWN BUT THEY CAN'T TELL YOU IF YOUR SHORT OR OVER UNTIL THE NEXT DAY! Stupid Right? Yes management has alot of nerve I wouldn't suggest this job to my worst enemy(just a figure of speech). Sprouts needs to make a bunch of changes and things still aren't better! I still speak to a few people that's there and they're on pins and needles everyday what a stressful work place! "
bad,i love seeing reviews from employees at sprouts. U
bad,"I have worked for this company for over 3 years and, I believe, can be succinctly described in a single word: disorganized. The company’s rules and policies change without rhyme, reason or clarification. Some times certain clothing is acceptable, other times not. Certain procedures aren’t written down and only when someone is terrible are some even implemented. Is not a long term place employment. Is a job to tode one over until a real career with true options and chance of success are more tenable"
bad,The company has gone downhill in the last few years. The turnover rate is horrendous usually the result of harrassment and bullying. Managment is very clique based. The current manager uses intimidation tactics and corporate refuses to help. Sprouts starts off at good pay but they expect the work of 20 from 1 person. Training here is non existent yet the employees are held responsible.
bad,"The Core management are very unprofessional and clueless to what their responsibilities are. They don't represent what a ""CORE"" team is. Definitely needs more training"
bad,I don't know about the rest of the country but here in Phoenix when the minimum wage went from 850 to $11 an hour Sprouts started f****** with everybody that was making a decent wage because they had to give all the minimum wage people $2 raise overnight but that's not our fault anyways I was severely disappointed I wasted almost six years of my life with that company
bad,"Sprouts only cares about what you can give to the company.  They dont keep to their own policies,  they never believe in their employees , they fobt take responsibility and everyone trains you with different different policies when they should all be the same. They dont compensate you well for a job well done,  they cut all hours even when you're not slow."
bad,"This company shows time and time again they do not care about or respect their employees in the slightest. You do not receive fair compensation for the amount of work you are expected to do each shift. Any praise by management is rare, on the other hand management is the first to throw employees under the bus."
bad,"Sprouts could care less about your life, hours, or needs."
bad,"Not worth it"
bad,"The head cashiers think they are the boss and cashiers are just their slaves. No one appreciates your work or motivates you. No respect or diginity ! There is no culture that feels like you wanna be a part of it for years. No one seems happy, cheerful everyone is just working like a machine. Especially the head cashiers are so disrespectful and not at all professional in their communication."
bad,"This place is unbelievable very unprofessional and poor management with racist men running the show cause this place is a circus for sure!"
bad,"All of their store across the country are identical whether they are in Arizona or Washington. They refuse to acknowledge that there might be a difference in the preferences of their clientele from one region to another."
bad,everything they say they stand for they do not behind the scenes this company has its own political corruption and the hr actually works against the employees and always side with management which is a group of people who have personal connections outside of the company.
bad,This company is like the bad news bears of sports I was an assistant manager there they forced me to work at nights alone wouldn't give me breaks one day I got sick of this and I took a 45 minute break clocked out for a half hour so I was accused of time clock theft for the other 15 minutes and was put on my final warning as a way to bully me into not taking my breaks cause I was in the meat departments
bad,"Horrible management that lies to you all the time, hire you at fulltime but expect to be cut down to less than 10 hours a week even as low as 4, no job security, they use to to their own benefit and toss you to the side after, they don’t post the following weeks schedule until the Friday before, extremely poor morale and tons of disgruntled employees because all their hours were cut and they have bills to pay."
bad,Sad place to work.....not much more to say other than try as hard as you can to secure a job elsewhere before you accept a position here! You have been warned....
bad,"Horrible management. Lane accountability is ridiculous.  You get in trouble for other people's mistakes. Management would be missing 15 bucks from their register and you would get threatened termination if you were off by 5 bucks. Nothing went right, no hours, turn over is outrageous. Lowest paid management in the grocery industry."
bad,I learned never to get injured at this job. They will of course get a fellow employee to drive you to the hospital. Make you fill out paperwork to cover themselves. You will find yourself doing ALL the leg work with finding an adjuster and getting paid through work comp will be a fight.
bad,"90% turnover. That should be the writing on the wall. They have management, but not LEADERS. You are a person filling a spot. They dont care about you, they will find someone else to do your job, and probably for less! Management is condescending and nepotism runs rampant. Always understaffed and usually on the weekends. Working people 70+ hours then complaining when things arent right. HIRE PEOPLE, treat them with respect, train them and they will stay!"
bad,"So in comparison to other grocery stores I've worked at Sprouts is not union, basically meaning that they can legally give you ten hours in a week.  When union is legally having to give you 22.  Management was very bad. Most managers in the place told me to do multiple tasks in small increments time  that each individually would take a lot of time and effort.  Pay was not good at all and I kept asking for another position besides my own and they said no while they gave it to people who have been working there far less time then me and doing a far worse job.  I would ask for advice on how I can do my job better if that was the case and they were not very specific.  They also told me that when I resigned that I would get my sick days paid in my last check that I didn't use.  Come to find out that this information was false after getting last check."
bad,I worked in the meat department. It was unsanitary and the managment was horrible. I had 3 different head managers In 10 months was promised a promotion and instead had to train a guy to be the roll I was promised. He injured himself 2 weeks in and quit. My advice run from sprouts.
bad,"I was an assistant grocery manager, I worked in bulk, deli, grocery, cashier, and produce, every department treats employees like they are incompetent even if you have experience they won’t listen to innovative ideas, they will however talk about you behind your back and throw under every bus possible, they also will not put you in the department you ask for, ever."
bad,Sprouts does not pay well at all. Management is unprofessional and that is being nice. Was told one thing about hours worked when hired at a job fair and then something else when actually working in the store.
bad,"If you want to pay actual bills, do not work here. If you are a college student, it may be fine, but have a strong tolerance level. The work culture here is toxic and many workers there will agree. Management treats us like robots and not like actual people. The communication is that there is no communication. You are not trained properly from the start but they expect you to know everything. Some departments you can go above and beyond and it still wont be enough for them. All of this for very little pay as well. Get ready to get thrown under the bus for other peoples mistakes. They are always ready to write you up if they don't like you because there is a lot of pettiness going around. They show strong favoritism to certain people as well. Do yourself a favor and skip this one, if you value your sanity."
bad,The amount of pressure and work having to deal with practically by yourself or with the bare minimum of other employees is very absurd. Sprouts say they have competitive pay... HA! The CEO puts on a good front as well as the other corporates. Their goal is to basically work their employees to death with bare minimum pay as long as they can. You could be the best worker there and still get deducted from your so called “raise”. The managers are told to never give an employee 100% of their point even though they SHOULD BE. Sprouts is not what they say or what the customers think. Ever wonder why no one really smiles? Even if you catch one of us smiling were faking everything. Sad and stressed employees working here. This is so disgusting on how we’re treated. A lot of people I know work more than their job is required with the bare minimum of pay. Where are the morals?
bad,"With the way this market is growing, it would have surpassed WFM if they cared about employees just a little more than expected cause they don't. There are more managers than employees, which means you have over 5 people telling you what to do, but there is usually one employee per department and it's a MARKET! How did it grow so fast, cause of its prices and quality. But it won't last very long, the departments across Sprouts are the most unorganized markets I've ever worked for. Once people really catch on to their corruption, it will close just like any other market that gets greedy like they are. Corporate office needs to learn, if any market wants to be WORLD WIDE like WFM, you got to cut off the employees a far share of the pie, which they refuse. Very large company but the worst treatment of employees period. They need to stop with the management and hire regular employees! JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE!! Maximum profit, eliminate costs. 3 or 4 mangers per store not 6! All departments lack employees, so prepare to work your butt off like never before. No training included as well, you're just dropped off in the department you belong and just figure it out, no training AT ALL. So you better have experience working here. Good luck."
bad,"Store managers are lazy and rude to employees, my store is on its third manager in less then a year.  Only eligible for a 3% raise or less once a year. Insurance plans are WAY too expensive. Promotions are rare. Everyone is treated as disposable. Decent starting pay, but don’t expect to ever make more then what you start at. Hours are flexible and by that I mean your hours may get cut at any time. The store is run on the fewest hours possible, and it shows, lots of out of stocks=unhappy customers=unpleasant work environment. Break room has 4 metal folding chairs and you get written up if you don’t take your unpaid breaks. Also don’t call out if your sick, you can get written up for that also. lines are typically long, more unhappy customers. Don’t believe anything your told by management unless it’s in writing and you have a copy. I could go on, but hopefully you get the idea. Go to Walmart or any other grocery store."
bad,"horrible management, hours are not guaranteed, not the company it makes itself seem out to be. They do not care about you it is all about customer satisfaction and everything else does not matter."
bad,"If you enjoy being overworked, under payed, stepped on by upper management then this the place for you. Even as a teenager looking or a part-time job, I'd recommend working else ware."
bad,"They make a lot of promises with no follow-up. I was hired for full time but within a month, I was at 30 to 35 hours per week. Lots of preferential treatment to certain employees. There was very little training for the position I was hired for. Very little support or encouragement from management"
bad,No training and just flat out awful. management sucked and the senior clerks just manage to sneak around for 8 hours while you do all the work. Have Fun!
bad,"I had a bad experience and the pay definitely did not match the work you had to do."
bad,"Sprouts is an awful company.  From poor management, to a useless HR department, to various unrealistic expectations, it seems the whatever the original idea was that created the Company, has since spiraled completely out of control."
bad,"It starts off as a good run, but it slowly hits the fan over time. An unprofessional environment that tries to be professional. You'll have some great coworkers and managers, but they end up having hours cut or get fired. Only for desperate people."
bad,Poor management with micro management make the job very stressful. Management shows no appreciation for their employees. It's very under compensated as well.
bad,"A typical day would include cleaning and friendly customer service. Mornings are slow, but afternoons are busy. Customers are usually easy going. Management can be better."
bad,Been there since the store open I have Had my up and downs but overall love the people I work with we make it fun even when customers are hard to deal with
bad,"I was hired as an assistant manager, but filled the role of grocery manager after a month, because my boss got hurt. I received a pay increase only to have it taken away 2 months later. I had to constantly come in on my day off and not get any overtime pay, because they would make you come in late or leave early. Then you would get punished on attendance side, because you came in or left early when they told you too. Their warehouse (KEHE and Natures Best) are terrible because they constantly are out of stock on products, or they send you other stores order or products."
bad,"Terrible management, I am desperate to leave this company, hours are incredibly scarce, management has the wrong priorities. Hardest part of the job is dealing with unnecessary meddling, easiest part is the actual job"
bad,"I love the idea of sprouts.  The fact that they work to provide healthy foods that are more locally sourced and sustainable is great.  The problem is they are poorly managed, the staff is miserable and the company policies are not the best.  A good example of how little thought goes into what they do would be my experience after I left the store.  I received a letter stating that they were very sorry but one of the members of Human Resources had responded to a phishing email.  As a result, all of my tax information including my social security number, address, and my full name had been sent to an unknown individual."
bad,"It felt a lot like high school going in everyday. The ""cool kids"" got management positions and higher pay. Management would not inform you properly of policy changes, and many inappropriate jokes were made at employees by management."
bad,It was fun for a little while until we started to be punished for managers actions while they get to keep their hours and money all the little people of the store get suck with little to no hours and no one is ever full time. they are so cheap they over staff the store just so that everyone stays part time and they do not have to pay benefits. also whenever there is an issue with someone either they will try to slowly kick you out of the store by taking another few hours away each week instead of just talking and working tout the problem so everyone can move on as adults.
bad,"Good place to work part-time, bad place to work if you want to advance with the company, management does not care about your comfort or your well being when involving customers, customer abuse was apart of the job."
bad,No job in this place is hard. However if you're not a friend of a friend then you don't move up. You WILL get thrown under a bus so management can protect themselves or friends.
bad,"Horrible Compensation, Need to pick up other peoples flack due to fact that if you don't you are reprimanded, not enough gratitude given for doing a great job and horrible treatment of employees I wouldn't get anyone of my friends or family work for this horrid company. The only good thing is that the day goes fast(sometimes) and you work in AC all day and if you like helping customers, most are very nice and somewhat reasonable with their requests"
bad,One of the worst companies I have ever been associated with!
bad,"They started off just alright, but once I got used to the place I saw just how little anything apart from making money means to them. Even if it means giving your blood, sweat, and tears to please them."
bad,"If I could give negative numbers I would. Trust me this is / was the worst job  I have ever had. "
bad,"They are always cutting hours, pay isn’t worth the amount of stress this store and management puts their employees through. Management has no authority over their employees and everyone takes advantage of that. Store 119 is out of control."
bad,"This company was brand new in NJ, when I started. They did not have all their ducks in a row and hours promised were cut."
bad,Very uncaring company that uses people. Making  false promises to workers that is severely mis- managed and horribly run. I would not recommened them.
bad,"By far the worst company I have ever worked for!! They are supposed to be centered around produce and after over 40 years in the grocery business, they have the worst produce I’ve ever seen. Plus, they don’t like older workers."
bad,This job does not give you the benefits of being FT.  But will give you hrs like you are  summer  and winter time your hour will be reduced drastically you may get 2 or 3 days. If you get 20 hrs a week best believe they will try to give  you 5 four hr days. This place is a joke they hire anyone  and dont pay you what you are worth even with previous  experience. If you need a job go and work for Sprouts. But dont plan a future there.
bad,"Store Managers at Sprouts Farmers Market set the tone for each store. When an employee is terminated and the Store Manager says, “Good, that’s one down, 12 to go!” it indicates he has a personal agenda to fire team members.  This information was provided to and through the proper channels, it was never followed up on."
bad,"** This is all specific to the front end “Head Cashier” position** My job was okay in the beginning. I went to “Cashier Camp” and was trained on how to be a Cashier, which is more of your job than anything else because some of the cashiers are too slow to function on their own. I went into this job completely blind because I had very very little to no training. My whole experience with Sprouts was DRAMA. Day after day, night after night. **This next part is specific to the Folsom location, please keep that in mind** All of the drama was caused by ONE female Head Cashier who is so far up the store managers a** its beyond belief. My whole time there was this female constantly trying to get me fired because I walked into her position and learned it in a month PERFECTLY. Jealousy was a huge factor. So it was day after day of being pulled into the office, being scolded by managers for things I never did because she made it all up. Again the DRAMA was overwhelming. This store is all about favoritism. If you aren’t a kiss a** and you don’t accept and adapt to the bullying you’ll be fired within a couple months, or if you tough it out they will make it unbearable to work there. They play favorites with no shame at all. Management is horrible. HORRIBLE. The store manager sits in the office all day long, only comes out when corporate is there and acts like she knows everything thats going on. The store manager has little minions (including the head cashier from above) who run to her and tell her everything thats going on. So they can blatantly lie and you will be reprimanded for anything"
bad,Tbey threatened me discrimination towards me when i wote home team clothing for sporting events blamed me for not doing thier jobs. Wouldnt do my review wouldnt give me a raise wouldnt teach me how to becoke a meat cutter. Would talk down to me make fun of me to my face and behind my back
bad,"experience and knowledge means nothing nowadays. It’s not what you know, it’s who you know. There is no sonority. Very clickie environment. Feel unappreciated"
bad,"Company does not care about employees and teaches managers to be the same way. Personal life and mental health is not a concern to them. Not even guaranteed to be payed correctly. I’ve worked for many companies and held multiple positions at them, Sprouts is a horrible company."
bad,No managment stability whatsoever. Poor leadership.  Lots of drama and cliques. Worst job ever. Oh and don't ever need medical attention because they won't call an ambulance.
bad,Management has an unsure mindset of what's needed to run the company. Not helpful in problem solving. Lack of compassion for associates. Management has very poor judgement on employee issues.
bad,"Poor management. I was always in trouble for doing my job. Taking out the trash when it’s about to overflow and getting in trouble, leaving when I’m scheduled to because overtime wasn’t allowed and getting chastised for it, being asked to leave and come back later because I showed up for my scheduled shift but they decided to switch it to a later shift without letting me know."
bad,The management will threaten you with your job for no reason and if you feel like the is work place violence going on dont go telling HR cause they will inform the associate and not do anything about the associate.
bad,Low pay horrible customers  and corporate bigwigs who care nothing absolutely nothing about their employees !  The only good thing about this job is the people I work with. Oh and then there’s the horrible music that is constantly playing the same songs over and over again!
bad,"No one stick to the rules ."
bad,Empower and motivate your team members. Cutting their hours drastically and holding them accountable for not getting tasks done is a bit contradicting. People need job security. If hours are constantly cut then people just sorta give up and start looking for work elsewhere. Once they give up it reflects in their performance. Management is more concerned with bonuses than their employees
bad,Management was cruel and unhelpful. They took advantage of my knowledge and skill sets. I was often disregarded and felt like I wasn't really welcome there.
bad,"The manager hated me for no reason . "
bad,"If you are REALLY hurting for a job, then go ahead and take a position with Sprouts. They have a constant revolving door, so getting a job there is pretty easy. However, if you value yourself to any degree, I suggest looking elsewhere. You're just a body to them, and will work you as much or as little as they see fit without any regard for what your needs are. Trust me... pass on this one."
bad,"You have good people supporting families on next to nothing, which is heartbreaking. The customers are entitled and awful but that's the majority of retail. The lifers at this company are amazing but get treated and compensated horribly, work here for the summer as a student and get out."
bad,"They pay you more than a couple grocery stores, but other stores are now catching up and flying by us bumping up their pay to about $2 more an hour than us. They start you out at their minimum wage no matter how much experience you have. Management is awful. Have been with them for two years, was a great job at first and went downhill VERY fast. No room for advancement, they hire outside before they think about promoting. Don't waste your time."
bad,No hours. If you call in sick one day don't expect to get hours the next week. Manigers are mostly young with no experience they just promote whoever.
bad,"One of the worst jobs I've ever had. This job was setup to fail, highly judgmental religious pieces of garbage that worked here. Everything was always my fault, even though I had great customer service and received at least 7 or so 5$ store gift cards for amazing customer service, and I had only been there for less than 3 months,  they started me out at about 40 hrs a week, but slashed them down by half because the religious church idiots dident like the fact that I have hair dye...OH NO BATMAN! My coworkers were also very jealous that they only had 2 of the store gift cards that you got when a customer or mngr recognized you out of the 2 years they had been there. One kid dipped snuff behind the counter while wrapping meat and management never said anything.....yea, let that sink in. But me.....ohhhhhh you better not have tattoos or hair dye. The department mngr that was there at the time told me I should have taken shrimp that had fallen on the floor and rinsed it off and put it back in the case......instead of throwing it away.......let that sink in too....."
bad,"This was a terrible experience working at Sprouts. The company leads you on into thinking that full time will be no less than a certain amount of hours per week. Hours are constantly being cut in every department. There is no overtime.  The amount of work you do for the pay is ridiculous. Management does not take their employees seriously. Whenever you express any type of concern in the workplace, it goes unnoticed. Working at Sprouts was truly the biggest disappointment. They promote healthy living and the well being of others when in fact I felt the most depressed and unhealthy working there."
bad,Management is so bad. They don't care about their employees and the conditions they work in on a day to day basis. The cliental continues to grow where the amount or workers continue to decrease yet they do nothing to help the stress of the remaining workers. Sprouts has turned extremely corporate and had completely stopped caring about the conditions of their employees. If you do a slack off job they will pay you more then the hard workers you see busting their butts. Btw be prepared Easter is NOT a holiday here so be prepared to work regular store hours and not get paid holiday hours for you extreme stress levels. I do not wish this depression or stress on anyone. #sproutsdoesntcare
bad,Sprouts is not the best place to work. They do higher on the spot but  have super high turnover rate.  Customers are horrid and the management is not that great either
bad,"Sprouts is not a good place to work due to poor management, inconsistent work hours, and poor pay. My job duties were only to check customers out and clean up at the end of my shift, but management and scheduling were so poor, I had to cover duties in other departments that I wasn't even qualified to do so and stay later than required because the managers would send whole departments home and leave us to finish their work at the end of the night."
bad,"They try sale on how great job is, but they lie and say your full-time but give you below 20 for 4 hr shifts for 5 days. They blame sales on why you don't have hours.  They pay extremely low also."
bad,"Workers treated unfairly"
bad,"I was scheduled to come in at 10. Boss calls at 930, asks if I want to vover a night shift. I want to be promoted to nights and say this as an opportunity to prove that I can handle it. I bust my buns. I make about 300$ worth of overnight production the first night. The second I make 500$ worth. After working 10pm to 6am, I come back in to work at 2pm and my boss tells me that my coworker whom is an idiot, a racist, and sexually aggressive towards the women at work (managment has been informed but nothing was done), has the job I tried to get. "
bad,"The company is only interested in you if you plan to be their slave the rest of your life. If this would be a stepping stone for you, they will treat you like trash and laugh at you as they step all over you. Don't even think about management if you have ANY other commitments in your life."
bad,"I worked for the company for many years never got recognized for my hard work had to watch higher-ups do the minimum while the lowers did the maximum management does nothing about complaints or concerns management did not encourage teamwork nobody was on the same page it was just a very uncaring environment not a good experience if you're the type of person that takes advantage of your company and wants to do the bare minimum while management pretends not to see THAT, and gets paid for it, sprouts is your job!"
bad,"The lower management (1 in particular)at this company are terrible. The lack of professional courtesy is almost unbelievable. The one manager in particular does not have the people skills required to do the job, making all employees dread when they are working. Many have quit just because of it. It is a laid back job, when the person in question is not there. Maybe one day Sprouts will get tired of losing people because of this person. Until then, do not work here! Also, no chance for raises. Worked very, very hard for almost a year now, and no raise."
bad,Several managers including myself have been asked to step down or go on leave due to pregnancy. Required overnights always on call and even responsible for everything when its your day off so if your order was wrong from the warehouse it is your fault or if someone calls in. Inventory tracking is horrible. Its based off chips on the shelf no computer tracking
bad,"worked 60+hours/ week, never getting to see my child, had cancer, lost my mom and never received any moral respect/support while going threw this.You are a slave to them. Verbally, physical and sexually harrassed. Managers don't care. The environment is toxic."
bad,"-Management does a horrible job communicating weekly and monthly goals for each department. "
bad,the day I was hired I was told the lease of hours that I would be scheduled was 32 hours per week however I was then cut down to working anywhere from 2-3 days per week and at the most was working 8-12 hours.
bad,"On my last day of working there, as I arrived at my vehicle, the store manager formulated a story to the police department. That of which arrived as I was about to leave."
bad,"Items scanned per minute and produce memory tests were the golden standard for cashiers. There were zero instances of a front end worker getting Employee of the month in any employee's memory, even the one that's been there for longer than the location has been a Sprouts, despite the employees' general acknowledgment that front end was the hardest job on the floor. The cashiers answered phones, got the brunt of every complaint about expiration dates and poorly stocked or organized shelves and handled the returns for things like rotted chicken, pork, beef, and fish and were constantly targeted by Short Changers. We were not adequately supplied with things like floormats for the 8-hour shift on our feet in one spot and one of the managers at that time was so incompetent at handling the registers that he repeatedly got cashiers fired for his own money-handling mistakes that couldn't be specifically traced to his log-ins. Only work here if you don't pay rent or bills."
bad,Growing company gaining in shares losing in culture. Opportunity for advancement highlights the attractiveness of Sprouts. Low operating costs and insufficient training techniques make this job too stressful in comparison to competitors
bad,"During the time that I worked at sprouts, they would cut my hours down to a little over 10 a week, which was not acceptable because I was guaranteed at least 24, the management at sprouts was terrible as to they did little to help their employees and did not seem to respect them. Overall it was a terrible place to work due to the little respect and time management had for it's employee's."
bad,"Working with Co workers was cohesive. However my department had highest sales in region but $1.30 raise in 4 yrs.  Mgt. constantly harrassed about insignificant issues.  Won several sales contests but 90% of feedback was negative."
bad,Horrible work environment the management do not care about employees they rather just hire a warm body for cheap than to pay anyone proper for experience
bad,"I worked there for two years. They were slow at doing yearly evaluations. My first one was three months late and my second a week late. Near impossible to get good evaluations. No career advancement for deserving employees, only who managers like. Not enough hours for department to succeed. No training when hired. Too many people micromanaging. Not really a department manager on same level as all others in the store."
bad,"No set work Hours that always get cut, No Benefits until you work there for a long time, and Cut-throat management. Every one of the management is set in their positions. Which means No room for career advancement and most positions that do open up are filled by other management already working in other locations. As an associate the management will tell you about possible positions may open and give you management responsibilities without a position ever opened up, so no compensation for the additional work you take on will receive. So read job responsibilities and stand your ground with management, but in doing so, you will also lose hours until you have no choice to quit the position."
bad,These people will use you until you are dry and nothing left ...if you like doing everybody job and getting paid like your doing one job then be my guest.just remember this post after you do haha good luck
bad,"The environment and policies are corporate driven with the goals being to keep the shareholders in place and help the managers receive their bonuses."
bad,I used to get hours but they cut my hours because they hired someone else and discriminated me. While also not giving me enough money for my one year employement
bad,love what i do but lack of advancement and opportunities in the company itself.... they work well with my busy schedule and give me the time off i need no matter what..... really understanding but they wont listen to me when i tell them that i want to learn more and receive training in other departments and cross training.....
bad,"Poor management and training. They don't  care about their employees. They make you go to work even when sick or you will get in trouble. The pay is ok,but they do not appreciate all the hard work you put into Sprouts."
bad,"I work in produce, the most labor demanding department in the company. Ive been there since the grand opening, and i have put in so much hard work... Only for them to cut my hours and give me     4-10 hours a week because their sales arent meeting the projections our scumbag store manager sets. This company is driven purely on profits and could not care less about their employees. they did this to half the other people in the store until they quit so they didnt have to give unemployment. I hate to say all this because i really liked working here when the store first opened, but 6 months in i am wishing i got a job anywhere else. Its so disappointing to be hired somewhere at full time, to be pumped full of lies and false expectations only to crash and burn like this."
bad,"It was great meeting new customers everyday and working with the Vitamins and Health & Beauty products. The management was very, very challenging to work with. I love what Sprouts has as far as products but working in their environment was not positive."
bad,"Sprouts puts on a good front like many stores, but that's all it is, a front. When you get down to it, it doesn't work with its employees AT ALL. When you hire in you are told they will work with your schedule when it comes to scheduling work weeks but they completely disregard your schedule and create a work schedule that works for them and not you. The pay is very low and there are no raises...Which goes against their constantly played in store ads of ""we offer flexible hours and competitive pay."" The hours are not flexible and the pay is not competitive, these are just key words they use like many others to grab attention but it's not true. I met good people who worked at Spouts but everyone was over worked and underpaid."
bad,Sprouts is very good at making it as hard as they can to get your job done. The management team have the idea that they are being targeted. So they target their employees and make it as if you are always not doing enough.
bad,"New Company. Turn-over is constant. Assistant Store Manager has to step in every department and replace every employee that does not show up....including cash registers, deli, bakery, meat, produce, vitamin dept. Constant unnecessary inventory counts especially in deli and bakery. Work/ life balance is non existent."
bad,"I enjoy interacting with the customers, and my manager has been very flexible with my schedule, to allow me to pursue a degree in IT."
bad,Terrible management and because of that worst job I ever had! Employees very nice. Hardest part of the job was standing around waiting for business to pick up.
bad,"Not at all what I expected, hours cut on a daily basis, expect way too much from employees, not enough time to get everything that's needed done."
bad,"The job was very fun, but lacked productivity and professionalism. The managers were more worried about being friends with the employees rather than being in charge making sure the company was ran correctly."
bad,"this job pays you penny's and asks for the moon.  they don't give you good management support, will not hire qualified employees, and feel that you just need to deal with it.  they dont care about quality they only care about sales. everything is your fault no one else.  employee moral is very low at most of the locations"
bad,"This company is growing too fast & consistently making bad decisions concerning hiring, promoting, demoting, & terminating employees.  Extremely high turnover among management & hourly employees. Very little training. Very little communication of policies & procedures."
bad,"A typical day at work is with management staff that has no professional communication skills at all, they will walk right past you without even acknowledge you exist, UNLESS there is a problem then they are so condescending and try and make you feel stupid. Memos that get posted are horrible and not professional, they talk down to you like you are a child."
bad,"Been working here for about 5 months. I went from 40hrs a week then in october BAM hours got cut in half...the last 3 weeks I have had less than 20 hrs (others have as little as 8) and at 8 dollars an hr I cant live offf that. was promised a bus pass and 6 weeks later still no bus pass....no annual payraise....decent benefits, if you actually manage to get enough hours to qualify."
bad,"Upper management above the regional managers have no clue how to run a company. They come from companies that they failed with (like Albertsons, Acme) and now they failing Sprouts in the same way."
bad,"You'd think you were working in the Entertainment industry. You arent cared for. Only by Head Cashiers who, in the end cannot do anything and are not treated well either. Employee nepotism is pretty obvious. If you are best friends with the higherups, don't worry about calling out every day. They'll just forget about it. "
bad,"The managers constantly practice favoritism, nepotism, and discrimination. When brought to the attention of HR, HR tries to convince you that you are just misinterpreting things. You are underpaid, most make minimum wage. Courtesy clerks with zero experience make more money than cashiers. Stay away!"
bad,So many issues get reported to HR and they do nothing... they allow management to sexually harass employees and do nothing about it..management to come in intoxicated on many occasions and nothing done..certain employees are untouchable no matter what they do.
bad,managers do not know what they're doing. Major favoritism. I asked to be trained on different things multiple times and they didn't bother with me. So stressful to the point where it's not worth it for a part time job. The deli is so disgusting and health code is definitely violated.
bad,Choose any other place to work but here unless you dont care about much of anything. They require alot from you and the pay sucks!!! Stay away!!!!!!!!
bad,"If you r a trainer you are screwed no job advancement, no appreciation on how much focus and heart you put. And you must keep up with everyone even though you train 2 days out of the week and they have the nerve to tell you that you came in 3rd place by an inch during the stack champions(employee of the month) this job was great a year ago now what ever profit they make off of this great team of hardwokers instead giving them awards or raises they buy cameras and other ways to make the job harder the expect to work like someone who has more than 3 years experience which is easy for t them considering they drink a monster per break"
bad,"one of the most mismanaged businesses i have ever worked for, all the way up through corporate. was constantly outside of my work realm doing things for other departments because store managers would just sit around ""delegating"" ."
bad,"Sprouts does not do things fairly, they cut hours on the day that you go in to work. And not calling before you have wasted your time getting up on the morning getting your self prepared for a day at work. And they don't let you cut 1 hour of time it's like a whole day of work, not being able to pay the Bill's that have from what they are paying but yet they still cut your hours."
bad,"Sprouts Farmers Market can be a great place to work for if, it wasn't managed by people who favored employees they befriended at other places of employment.  If they give department manager's more individual freedom within the department, the working environment would be great. They do not hold everybody equally responsible according to the sprouts employees handbook. I thought I was working for a great company but I was easily mistaken.  If they were to get better store management, more employees that were part time since most of the employees are part time it could be a better place to work and a more profitable business. I enjoyed my position while I was there and would go back, if they changed."
bad,Terrible place to work. Pay and raises suck. Management is terrible. They have a request days off program but you better not use it. Most employees are great the other still live in a high school click even tho they are over 40. Sad. Apply some place else. Don't waste your time.
bad,"I have been in the grocery industry for 22 years. And the experience at my 1 year at Sprouts was by far the worst. I am very team orientated and built a strong team. But I succeeded with sales and shrink, with no real training. Sprouts depends on training you got from previous jobs. And makes you struggle to understand ""There Way"". You constantly are pressured to meet the expectations of the company without any real understanding of the process or vision of the company. I was thrown in my role as department manager on my 3rd day after the previous manager quit suddenly. Red Flag! My direct supervisor has no food service experience what so ever, but I was expecting to lean on him for directions. All they did was look up a Bible's worth of information on the computer at throw it at you decipher the ins and outs. But never giving you anytime to actually read it. Plus they say there is absolutely no reading of said paperwork off the clock or training, but they take a blind eye to such practices as they know you have absolutely no time to do so. I read the comments from other previous employees and didn't take heed to the warnings. Seriously regret that decision. Company wide the entire establishment from top to bottom is a mess. They are to new in the grocery industry and all there original ideas are not. Also there ideals of holding on to the really old ways of doing things as well as trying to stay new age absolutely don't work. For example having a salad bar open at 7 o'clock in the morning is ignorant. You have so much wasted labor as you have to bring in 3 people for that and"
bad,"Hr doesnt do there job, took them 2 months for a background check on a clean record. Management changes to a new incompetent every three to six months and entire store turned around at least yearly. If you need something to get you by for a month or two and don't mind being driven to alcoholism from horrible work environment and the most entitled snobby customer base you've ever encountered be my guest, otherwise stay far far away. Also have to feel ok with ripping people off, stores clearly for people to stupid to know there being ripped off."
bad,Everyday i went to work was chaos. The store is typically busy throughout the day but short staffed with management unwilling to help unless a customer complains. I loved my coworkers and the items we sold but wish our location wasn't set up for failure upon opening.
bad,"I worked for Sprouts for 3 years and simply put, they do not care about their employees. Several injustices happened during my career at Sprouts and they do. not. care. I was sexually harassed, he was transferred and promoted to assistant meat manager. Recently, a physical altercation occurred in the deli and he is still working. He did not receive any form of reprimand other than a mild scolding in the office. Supposedly, HR knows but it does not seem to matter. The apathy runs deep within the company. They will also want you to perform duties far above your pay grade almost all of the time."
bad,"I worked here and was immediately yelled at to hurry up on my first day on the job by the manager despite being a new employee with no training. Not much learned here except how to stock items their very specific and odd way and how to operate pallet jacks. Management is switched out at random times, store is unmonitored sometimes, and employees don't seem to want to collaborate with each other. Hires too many people at once to cut peoples' hours."
bad,At Sprouts Farmers Market you can expect a long day of work with a lot of different duties and responsibilities. The company is employee friendly help
bad,"Pros: Pay was decent, can be promoted quickly, coworkers are usually nice people. If you're in a management position you get benefits."
bad,"Very stressful environment for lower management, no real support from upper management. Extremely fast paced and very little consistency with everyday employees showing up or being held accountable. Negative culture, not much camaraderie."
bad,"I worked mainly facing shelves there during the evenings. I was 99% of the time working alone, and balancing customer needs is claimed to be the most important aspect but it isn't. The management only cares about what you get done during your shift. My dedication to customer service was ignored completely and I received to praise for it. The culture is weak there, as the pillars they created are illusionary standards that you are not held to completely. The hardest part of the job would be having to balance doing your work and helping all the guests in your section."
bad,I would an not recommend anyone to work here.  Corporate is often contacted about the store from the employees various complaints.  Bad management starting with the store manager and it trickles down.  The workers are over worked in minimal hours then forced to take a lunch which cuts more into your hours worked. This store is a total mess! By far the worse place. I have ever worked.
bad,"Sprouts has the basic goings of a great employer.  Stores are amazing to work with.  "
bad,"i don't think I've worked at a place as bad as sprouts farmers market. managers would totally ignore any and all applications of current employees to move up the ranks but would hire new fish like it was nothing, only to find out that those people are completely useless."
bad,"Publicly traded - used to be privately owned and was all about the culture, employees, family, etc. not like that at all now. It's about becoming automated, less employees, more work, less hours, more deadlines."
bad,"I began working for Sprouts 2 years ago in the Support Office. Since working there my entire team has been to HR about management or lack there of. There was never any follow up regarding HR related reports that were filed and everything was brushed off in Hope's we would just forget. Corporate greed is slowly showing its face. Many directors and higher ups are losing their jobs due to ""iliminating job positions"" with no alternative job offer. People who have been here for years are losing their jobs and Sprouts doesn't care. That's bad for business!! They are bringing in contractors to come in and act as managers to push people out of the company so they can pay new employees at lower pay rates. This company is not what it once was and the vision and mission is a disgrace and a farce. Think again about working for a company that would prefer turn over instead of keeping valuable trustworthy employees. Do not work for this company!!"
bad,"the job itself offers a few benefits that seem initially very appealing, but overall you will have a hard time utilizing them. The frequently shifting hours will make it difficult to remain qualified for the benefit of a full-time employee, which includes affordable health insurance. Between that fact and the unpredictable scheduling (posted sometimes days before) will make it almost impossible to utilize any PTO or paid vacation time you might have earned. The work itself is strait-forward but the demands are high, and the reward is low."
bad,"This used to be a good place to work, but has become too much of a big corporation culture. All about the money and not about the customer or the little guy."
bad,"Promises never kept by management, couldn't keep good employees, management treated employees horrible. When I became a manager store manager told me not to be nice to the people in my department. Too much of the blame game. Just a BAD place to work."
bad,Working at that location was a bit of a nightmare.  I wasn't given any opportunity for advancement.  The hours provided we not enough to make a living.  I was only paid 9.73 dollars an hour.  Management had the tendency to micromanage.
bad,"I don't want to go into detail here. But will be more than happy to explain my situation in a phone or personal interview. In my tenure with Sprouts, I ran a very successful Produce Dept in which I made all of my sales projections and labor budgets."
bad,"Always short handed, never enough employees, turnover was nearly immediate, even with so few employees half the time you wouldn't get more than 25 hours a week. overall would not recommend."
bad,"No training given"
bad,Im a goal type person did not work for me at that particular store .Management was immature lot of my co. workers were just collecting pay checks would come work and talk all day.
bad,Management never communicates with anyone. You could work your butt off for years and then ask for a promotion and they'll tell you that they will give you one and they never will. They do that to make you work harder but they just string you along talking like they want you to succeed in the company but they don't care. They tell you what you want to hear so you'll shut up. When it comes to hiring for team leaders and department managers they'd rather hire from outside the company so that they can pay the lowest they can. God forbid you promote someone who knows what they're doing. The team members that they hire are all awesome though. That's the only bonus to working for this company. Everyone below management is super awesome! We all just suffer together.
bad,"Terrible  in- store management, even worse corporate management. Woudn't advise anyone to work here. They don't pay well at all. Front end doesn't get breaks."
bad,"I really enjoyed managing the team I had. I enjoyed the customers and the positive feedback they would give about the store I managed. Most days were very hectic and a lot of paperwork and unnecessary conference calls which took me away from taking care of the customer and managing the store.  Regional team was never available when we needed them to help out with training. In my 8 years with the company we had 4 regional directors and at times we didn't have a regional director or trainer at all. Each regional director had different expectations and were not consistent with Sprouts Culture and Core Values. When the regional team did visit the store their expectations were not in line with the directives sent down from the corporate office. The regional director manages by fear, threatening to fire you if the store wasn't in ""Grand Opening"" condition everyday and especially when corporate visitors were in town. When I started with Sprouts our main focus was superior Customer service and to take care of the employee but that became irrelevant after going public."
bad,"The employees are good people. The company lacks communication, culture and a work life balance. I learned to select my next work place much more carefully."
bad,"management only promoted those who they are friends with not who deserved it. most of my co workers were great but most were not trustworthy and neither was head management. the attendance policy is a joke! management never followed through with those who are/were late or called in sick or excused the ones that they were close to so they wouldn't get reprimanded for there attendance."
bad,Company has too many family members working with each other supervisors are above a sister or brother inlaw. Too much drama with family in the stores.  Not enough support from upper supervisors too much lieing to protect their own jobs.
bad,The bakery manager has issues. I never got a break and I was assistant manager. If I took a break everything fell behind. You work your rear off just to maybe get a break. My feet swelled up every day because I never got off of them.
bad,"I feel like sprouts could work on how they treat employees. Give the people that have earned it a chance to move up in the company."
bad,The employees are Great and honestly some of the best I’ve worked with but there is no fun culture there very cut throat management the organization is very biased to new team members versus old sprouts employees there is no job security and opinions of others in charge can impact your job  it’s all about putting your head down and working as fast as you can they simply only care about results daily not there employees
bad,"Leadership from ceo down to store management is a laughing stock. The deli, bakery and meat are side shows. They want to sell vitamins and produce. That’s it. No reinvestment financially or morally."
bad,"Might just be the one I work at but the managers all contradict each other, there’s no trust that experienced employees know what they’re doing and it’s all about how little hours can we use and how much of a workload they expect to get done, the hard working employees get spat on and abused while the idiots get to screw up and never be let go, the idea and what they tell you the company is supposed to be like when getting hired was great, unless they get proper management though, it’s hard to see it ever be that way"
bad,"For the courtesy clerk position you will receive NO HOURS I repeat NO HOURS!!! They give you hours your 1st 2 weeks but after that your only scheduled for 1 day out the week more then likely for just 5 hours. Oh and dont let it be slow, they will send you home for sure (but keep in mind you only doing 5 hours). And the pay once a week so that's no money for you to cover anything but gas &"
bad,Upper management would bring in people from stores with no Warehouse or order picking experience to work at the warehouse. Every one of them never had experience driving a forklift or a floor jack. It was hard to follow orders people nothing about warehouses
bad,"The store manager is a truly disgusting human being who bully’s everybody around her while she sits in her office gossiping about team members all day with the help of her sidekick who then spreads lies about everyone....It’s high school everyday at that store, something needs to be done!"
bad,"Sprouts has the highest turnover rate I have ever experienced in my life. They are not willing to pay their good employees in order to keep them.   You are absolutely robbed on your annual raises, not being able to score more than 2.9 on a 1 to 5 scale,  therefore restricting you from getting any kind of yearly raises. They are always understaffed due to call ins and the inability to cover the shifts. As a head cashier, you are responsible for literally babysitting 5 to 8 cashiers a day. Running a break schedule and having to listen to their whining and complaining and not wanting to do what is expected of them.  It’s an absolute vicious cycle.  There is potential to grow within the company, if you are able to put up with  more than your fair share of BS in order to get there."
bad,"The produce department in particular is no fun. Management is all over the place, communication is spotty, and you are likely to be lied to. Hours are inflexible. You will be ineligible for promotion if you have anything other than open availability. My employment with Sprouts slowly changed from being amazingly fun and carefree, to ridiculously mismanaged and a complete dread. Managers have too much asked of them, they are stressed and overworked and that leads them to ask others to overwork themselves. Management gets angry when people don't seem to be completely crushed emotionally and physically under their work load. There are some really awesome people who work there, who try to make it a better place, who are unfortunately stuck in the same awful situation. Regardless of the department, they pay approximately $3/hr less than every other grocery store. For your sake, do not work at Sprouts in Folsom."
bad,"Guys please choose another company they will not pay you , worst experience of my life . You will regret it , if you join "
bad,Dept manager was great we had a good crew constantly cutting hours or too many worked open to close some days because of no coverage then no overtime would cut hours upper management had no clue what you did in departments but were the first to tell you were doing it wrong
bad,"I can't begin to describe how filthy the meat and seafood department was. There was cross contamination in the cutting room, they would put expired meat in twith the fresh grind(everyday). The seafood containers in the counter where only cleaned if I did it, then my manager would get in trouble because the seafood wasn't out and ready at 7. Why wasn't it out by 7 you ask, because it takes an hour and a half to clean it properly. I should have called the health department because I feared someone would get sick. So don't eat the meat or seafood at the 41st an Yale store in Tulsa."
bad,"All the team members kinda talk terribly about everyone that's there, like the managers and customers. The managers even talked badly about the workers and customers as well. You only get the schedule for the next week the Friday before, and even then they make changes to the printed schedule the next day and expect you to be aware of the changes somehow. Lots of time on your feet, but that was to be expected. The pay was decent for the amount of work I had to do, but they were super long shifts and I didn't usually get out of the store until around 30 mins after closing.  Oddly unsafe location too, the first day I was there a lady was mugged in the parking lot. I was told that they had hired a security guard because there was an issue with someone that had recently been fired threatening to come back with a gun. All in all, I would not ever work there again, mainly because of the terrible work environment and attitudes of people that work there."
bad,In the beginning working at Sprouts was fun. Once the managers were transferred things started going down. There is no professionalism or communication between managers and employees. The raises are annually and no more than 35 cents.
bad,Working here as a cashier is very stressful. They expect you to have total open availability. They tell you that you will not close and then open and that you don’t have to worry about that. That is not true.  They do it all the time.   The managers play favorites and are very rude specifically to head cashiers two of them are OK if the other two are not.  As a cashiers they expect you to stand there for eight hours in the same spot you cannot move from your register or they will write you up.  So by the end of your shift your feet are killing you. About half of the customers are very rude to you and if you have feelings because of it well you get in trouble.  About 60% of the cashiers have gotten fired with in the past week.  This environment is very stressful more then it should be.  Everyone does look miserable when you walk in because of how stressful it is.  I could be in the best mood when I walk in and within two hours in my shift and miserable and just want to make it through my shift and go home.  Instead of teaching you if you need to improve on something they just suspend you.  Your opinion doesn’t matter.  Let me put it this way  if you just need money quickly it’s a good place to work but I would only work here temporarily like as you were looking for a better job. Like this would be a last resort.
bad,"The Co-workers and the Costumers were incredible, although the management was HORRIBLE. If you had any complaints they did not care, if you were having difficulties with a co-woker you were always in the wrong (if they had been there longer than you). The store manage would use scare tactics saying how replaceable you were, threatening to send you to other stores, and if you went to HR he would berate you."
bad,"During my interview, I was supposed to work as a full time cashier. First of all, they only give you less than 20 hours per week. I would not work there if you have bills to pay. The benefits do look promising but they only give supervisors that. The store manager is actually really nice but some of the other managers micromanage you like you’re a child. You would think this would be the easiest job but with supervisors breathing down your neck, it’s surprisingly stressful. Would not recommend for anyone."
bad,"Do not work here if you think for yourself, period."
bad,"Poor management, most of the managers got promoted but were not qualified.  If you have issues and complain it will not get fixed. to much drama and gossiping"
bad,"This job was fun, ill give them that, but i was told false promises just so i would stay working, i was given a position but for such a low wage i had no choice but to feel insulted and i ended up leaving."
bad,"Poor management, Poor pay. The Workplace culture is a very unhappy. Company has a turn and burn attitude. High expectation from employees with very little time and resources to do so."
bad,Wasn't enough help hours was always cut every day for the week. Never got to 40 overall it was a job. But fired over..   Falsify Time sheet they say for $4.63. Doesn't scene intentionally
bad,"Store managers are ever revolving. They bring in their own friends or previous employees for positions they aren't qualified for and when they do bad they will write up staff that have been at the  store for years. Quick to throw anyone under the bus to protect themselves. "
bad,I spent eight years working for this company I had a loved one pass away lost my home girlfriend after 2 years and instead of them trying to be sympathetic about it they were just complete jerks all the way around I wouldn't recommend my worst enemy to work for this company you are underpaid
bad,"Too many chiefs."
bad,"Was great to start with because of my coworkers. As I advanced, I realized how corporate treated their employees. The pay is bottom of the barrel when compared to other Grocery chains such as Stater Brothers, Krogers, etc. As a Grocery Manager, I was asked to run half the store for about 8 dollars less per hour than I would have made at other chains. Expectations are unrealistic based on working conditions. Was expected to have less than 75 out of stocks when there was at least 50 per truck . Culture at this company has shifted from family oriented to money hungry. They prefer to hire from other companies for management. This leads to underpaid and inexperienced management. Hiring from big food chains does not offer knowledge in the natural foods world. Managers are expected to work overnights on less than a days notice. Corporate pressure is felt like the boot of Stalin on your neck. Everyone is pressured and scared. HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT. DO NOT COME HERE. YOU WILL NOT BE HAPPY."
bad,"Hard place to grow, corporate doesn't work with you in times of need. Don't really have anything else to add, just filling in the minimum requirement now."
bad,"very stressful. not much help. people didnt like to work.management didnt hold people accountable, people would come to work when they wanted to &call out for weeks and still would have a job."
bad,"Spouts was a terrible place to work in my opinion. The management sucked, they scheduled me one day a week, and when I did work, they kept us until like 1am. Right before I left they switched my sections hours to overnight (which I couldn't do because i was in high school at the time)."
bad,"Managers are horrible, customers are horrible.  No communication, don't care about employees, they say everyone is replaceable. They don't want you to advance"
bad,"You could be their best, most trusted employee and they could decide the next week to hire more people and cut your hours drastically immediately after giving you healthcare and a raise. This is not a company I would work for again"
bad,"Sprouts would be a great place to work if the pay was higher and the management was reliable.  Their ""customer oriented"" motto leaves something to be desired as well.  They continually run out of product and are always understaffed, especially in the front end.  The front end is the most important experience of the customer as it's the last place to come in contact with an employee.  The checkout lines are always long, therefore, a very long wait.  There is never a courtesy clerk to help bag groceries so the wait is even longer.  At certain stores it seems that the higher managers don't seem to care about the employees or the customers.  Morale is very low, too.  Scheduled hours are slim to none and they always make sure to give someone 6 hours or less so that one 15 minute break is all the employee receives.  The store itself is great for shopping, but I would not recommend employment to anyone."
bad,"Job is great if you have an extremely flexible schedule to work different hours of the weeks, no set day off. Every week is a different schedule, this can make planning Dr.'s appointment or personal events extremely difficult. Compared to Frys, this company is not based off of seniority, but how much of a dependable hard worker. That is what I admired. Would only go back if I lost my current job and had no other job lined up."
bad,You do your work and then leave. You get to work with others and it is like a family. Some managers are great and I love my part of the job and helping others
bad,"Truthfully, a really bad company to work for due to store and upper regional management. No opportunities to advance and they try to replace you by making your job impossible and forcing you to quit. Impossible to take breaks because they're constantly calling you and if you have an issue the managers tell you to figure it out on your own instead of helping. Oh and expect a 10 cent raise over a 1 year period."
bad,"Nothing but trouble, no support, bad communication,  demands are high with no thank you.  If you have any issue with work life balance forget about it; you're expected to live for sprouts, your family is last."
bad,THIS COMPANY ABSOLUTELY SUCK RUN WHILE YOU CAN WHEN business is slow they cut hours and send people home early making it hard to get the work done once again run while you can
bad,"Some of the most unhappy, unproductive and hostile co workers I have ever had to deal with, which trickles down from the extremely poor management."
bad,"Sprouts is the most unreasonable place to work, you have to work when they want you and be able to jump when they say so. I worked for them for 2 yrs and tried to go to school, I had to fight with my schedule to go to my classes and some days I would work a night shift when I had to be in class."
bad,"I personally have never worked for a more unorganized organization in my life.There is absolutley no training for newly hired managers, the store bookkeeper is supposed to be your resource for HR questions seems less knowledgable then most employees and the store director (manager) has no regard for corporate policy but corporate does not seem to care. In my short employment with Sprouts (I resigned after 3 months) there was a complete turnover of department heads--each had resigned from their position. Company policy is that next week schedules are to be posted no later then Thursday but EVERY week you would need to call in on Sunday to see if you worked the next day and your schedule for the week--a complete disregard for employees well being and work life balance. The store manager at my store had an obvious affection for the pretty young cashiers and made it his point to be around them as much as possible. It is a shame that such a great store is allowing a store manager to ruin the Sprouts name in Houston among potential employees."
bad,"It used to be a fun place to work when it was Henry's.  As soon as they became Sprouts they started to get rid of all the Henry's employees because we made more than what Sprouts was willing to pay.  The Management was not out for his employees, I was a full time employee & he cut my hours down to 16 a week.  He had his favorites.  I got along with my co-workers most of us had been there since the doors first opened.  The hardest part of my job was going there & not knowing if you were going to be picked on.  The most enjoyable was my customers, they liked me &  I liked them.  I got along with them."
bad,"co workers are great, management not really motivated to have employees happy or doing a job that highlight's there best talents. The hard part  is no training they stick you somewhere and you better figure it out. Management is  not above making up stories about you to get rid if you .Management is very scattered and unclear   about what direction the store needs to go. If you want to use your talents and move up, don't work here."
bad,"The first couple of years I enjoyed working for this company, It cared about its employees. In the last few years they stopped caring about their employees and were only concerned about the individual and where they can get in the company/ or how they could move up at the expense of other employees"
bad,"*I can only speak from my experience as a cashier so I don't know how other departments were treated* Store manager made very, very little effort to get to know front end employees. Never introduced himself personally (not even in interviews). Too many cashiers were hired so most of us ended up working 5-10 hours a week. Head cashiers and other employees were great."
bad,I enjoyed the people that I worked with but didnt like the fact that loyalty was not rewarded.  People can come and go no effort is made to keep some of the better people.
bad,"The management will fire you at a drop of the hat. They have high turn-over and sometimes there is so much for you to do that you cannot take breaks. They don't schedule around important events in your life, like medical appointments. There is no job security. Managment's attitude is ""its my way or the highway"". They underpay on the wages, but benefits are excellent."
bad,Sprouts is the worst employer. You have know quality of life while working for Sprouts. Management doesn't go by your availability when making the schedule. The schedule is only posted 2-3 days prior to the work week. And is only put out for that week.
bad,"Its challenging to work here due to the rudeness of stuckup rich customers. The management as well as the staff are always being fired, hired, or leaving. They don't give the amount of hours they promise they will expect part-time from a full-time hiring, and less than for a part-time hiring. They are always trying to cut hours and have a ridiculous program of the customer is always right. They will break corporate policy to abide by it"
bad,"Pros "
bad,"Poor management, they let other employees bully you the manager seems to be homophobic and has cut my hours down to 4 hours, he wanted me and then he wanted me and another employee that don’t get along to start a fight with one another and get ourselves fired. HR won’t do anything about it. You get up for wearing coats in the winter while pushing carts and going to the bathroom. Place is a joke."
bad,Got hired on the spot. Thought it was going to be a laid back stress free job. WRONG!! Managers constantly change your schedule without notifying you and then lie about it. There was so much drama between employees it was like being back in high school. Someone stole $100 from my locked locker and they did nothing about it. Customer service staff is lazy and rude. Would not recommend the 280 location.
bad,"I get into work at 4pm and usually the last day shift is leaving or about to leave within the next hour, and depending on how much they have done can determine how late I end up staying. Some nights I work with our assistant manager as he stocks the floor and unloads the latest truck of supply. I spend the first hour to hour and a half finishing any unfinished tasks (packing and labeling items), and straightening up the department to stage myself for the rest of the night. At around 5:30pm I bring a Baking rack and a shopping cart into the freezer with me for panning the artisan bread, and grabbing muffins for panning into muffin pans. I come out of the freezer and pan up the muffins, after replacing the muffins in the freezer, I tray up the dough for the next day. and end the day cleaning the department down to the floor. All throughout the day I will intermittently chat with coworkers and management. I felt like the training towards customer service was inadequate and not mitigated. Safety was not thoroughly enforced and to much ""meh, good enough"" attitude was going around. social dramas played out affecting other employees and customers. All  I saw from most of the management was the attitude of burying their head hopping the problem went away. and If you wanted most benefits you needed to work more than 30 hrs a week and hours were Constantly being Cut."
bad,"go in and start my position right away. "
bad,"Its an ok place to work, lots of employees feel unappreciated and over worked but it is retail and the company did go public a few years ago so it's understandable that they treat their workers like so."
bad,It was a fun workplace at the beginning but people come and go all the time here and so the dynamic is always changing. A typical day at work I would start off doing one task and then always would have to stop and help the counter and then eventually i would make my way back to my initial task and thats just kind of how the day would go. Always trying to finish a task and help the deli counter at the same time.
bad,"Although Sprouts is not my first place of employment, I believe it could be a god place to start."
bad,work anywhere but here management has no common sense they ask for the impossible; only thing that i can say that is great are the other employees I've worked with.
bad,"Pay was ok, coworkers were ok, customers were lazy and degrading, management was the worst I've ever encountered. Didn't care a lick about their employees and their well being. They also played favorites. Lots of micromanaging. Had to go on lunches and breaks when told, no flexibility. always called you back over the intercom before breaks and lunches were even over."
bad,"If you like being treated like an object or a piece of cargo go ahead and work here. I was looking for a job to gain some experience and some extra money but then realized I was cheated out of my labor. I did gain the job experience but they underpaid me because of my lack of education and want to make things worse for me. I was promised 40 hours a week and job benefits but got none. Instead I got 4 hour work weeks, excuse me but people like me need to make a living not live like a day laborer. When my department manager is around me, it makes me really stressed. Does not work in making my job better. They make courtesy clerks sweep the store, although I had no issues with it. "
bad,"I was excited about working here until I started. The first few days ppl were nice, but after that...I was and continue to be ignored. Even management doesn't speak to me. I feel I work hard,but I guess I dont work hard enough for them. It's so bad. I don't understand where ""managers"" think they can act like others are below them when THEY are the scum of the earth.  These are what you call pricks."
bad,"The company has very little concern to those that work on the floor as they will change you to nights and days with no notice as well as work you minimal hours and expect you to push yourself to meet their quota. The only enjoyable part of the job seemed to be when there was a rally to discuss the days plans, but once that broke up we were back to watching the clock. To move up was not a concern as likely the person above will either step down or leave within a few months just for a person who cares less about those beneath them takes the spot. If you need a job paying minimum and one that doesn't care about your outside obligations, have fun."
bad,"This is a terrible place to try and build a career. They will take advantage of you and move you around wherever they see fit, regardless of your actual position. The opportunity to get out of store level and into a career in upper management is minimal and theres no real guidance on how to do so, other than to become good friends with the district managers and contacts in corporate. Its all based off who you know, not what you know. And because of that fact, a lot of terrific candidates are passed up. Judgement is horrible by HR and if they dont solve your problem 9 times out of 10 theyll just stop responding to you. Horrible place to work, i will never return here."
bad,"If you looking a job that will work you like a dog, then sprouts is for you.  Management positions are stressful, you will do the job of 2 to 3 people, you will be expected to get it done in 40 hours, which makes the job stressful beyond belief.   Staff call outs constantly, which means it falls on the manager to get there job done and the clerks jobs done.  If your a hard worker than that will be exploited!   If your department has no manager and your the assistant manager, then expect that you will do both jobs!   Worst retail experience every, the money is not worth it, you will have no quality of life.   Even if you express your concerns over and over again, nothing will come of it."
bad,Ultimately the job is a grocery store based position.  Many days you are spoken to by multiple managers about facing products and filling holes in product lines.  At least every shift you will be spoken to by 3 or more managers and told to do things that may or may not be related to your job.
bad,"Absolutely horrid!  They cut my hours from 20 to just 5 or a 10 a week after just a month of working there!  They did this to everyone!  Very manipulative tactic to get you to jump through their hoops, make you desperate for hours and go in on your SCHEDULED days off.  My co-workers themselves are good people but how am I supposed to make ends meet when they clearly don’t want me there?  I do what they tell me, when they tell me but my efforts obviously aren’t good enough.  It makes me wish they’d just fire me and get it over with.  They lure you in with “good hours” but immediately slash them!  They are not to be trusted and it’s draining.  I’m sinking into a deep depression because of them!"
bad,"Sprouts has a frantic work environment that is typically dictated by corporate members who rarely spend time in the store. The old way of management has given way to a a more stressful style that lacks communication but is heavy in punishment. Moreso than other grocery chains, promotions and advancement aren't a product of merit, but more of knowing someone higher up. As a result, many managers aren't prepared for their role and lack the knowledge to properly manage their department or store."
bad,"The store management is very disorganized and careless. Hours are constantly being cut to save on labor costs so that affects customer service, employee moral and product quality and availability. Corporate needs to stop micro-managing every aspect of store duties and inventories so the management and employees can perform their jobs"
bad,There pay is non compatible with other grocery store. Presently I am looking for another part time job and is going to quit. Sprouts.  Thirty cents a year raise and no matter what type of employee you are.
bad,"The store manager would have people work all night on a change in retail presentation then his boss would come in next day and want something else. A lot of that kind of thing. Great pay. Good benefits. Nice people. Poorly managed. Goes to show great pay doesnt mean loyalty. Caring,and authentic people in leadership is key. No phonies. People dont respond well to fearing /intimidation"
bad,"They will do almost anything to not give you a pay raise. I've been yelled at in front of peers. I moved departments and when I did, the manager did not bother telling me I was getting a pay cut or that he was moving me down to part time. I eventually transferred stores and went back to my previous department. When I did, I got a raise, but it's less than what I started at. They also decided to change my anniversary date without my knowledge, so I don't get a pay raise for an extra 8 months. When it's slow, they constantly cut hours."
bad,I don't want to seem ungrateful for my position but I am! What bothers me is the unorganization of the specific store I work at and the corporate role that the store has.
bad,"Stressful and dealing with rude customers and managers."
bad,"Wasn't the health-centric friendly environment I expected. They don't even recycle. They claim ""Farm Fresh"", yet none of the produce in my store is even from my state, let alone the country. Some Sprouts brand products are GMO, and we still carry items with HFCS in them. They aren't nearly as ""Green"" as they pretend to be. "
bad,"I've worked at sprouts for about 8 months now and I first started out as a courtesy clerk/bagger. It was a great job at first, bagging groceries for hot older moms, doing some cardio getting carts. Not bragging or anything but I believe I am one of the few people at my store with common sense (90% of the working staff is a drone who's soul has been drained from labour overtime) and I believe management was quick to notice. In all seriousness, after 3 weeks I was promoted to produce clerk and the job all of a sudden was a lot more entertaining and strenuous. I cannot tell you the amount of knowledge about produce I have received from this job. However without me ever knowing it, my job title never changed after 4 months of becoming a produce clerk until my produce manager mentioned to me I wasn't on the schedule. Apparently thus whole time I was still under the courtesy clerk's schedule. My wage stayed at 10.00 flat until I finally asked management about this. And after multiple confrontations with the lazy managers who constantly tried to avoid it, and 2 weeks later, my job title finally changed and my pension was increased to $11/hr. Its been half a year working with my produce team and this is my overall conclusion, I do apologize for the length of this review btw just want to get my opinion out there :P"
bad,Not the best company in the world at first it was fantastic and i loved it but I've noticed a pattern to where they can't keep anyone hired and it makes the job very stressful on everyone
bad,"I loved working with people and doing customers favors when I could. The only reason I quit was because the management was poor. They would call me to come into work when I was in school even though they knew my schedule. They also only worked me 1 or 2 days a week at the max, causing me to only make 44-88$ a week."
bad,Sprouts is not the greatest place to work I came in after the store was open that store was in such disaraythe employees did everything but worked it was horrible I tried to clean it up and fix it no hope.....
bad,"Management is horrible. I would go to work everyday and work hard just to have nasty notes left for me. Three other people quit because of department manager, yet nothing is done. This company has nothing to offer."
bad,Not a good place to work!!!!!!!!! No traing in produce. Sink or swim. They play head game with the schedule. This company has high turn over and will fail with the management they have in place. The didn't even give me an employee hand book. And I asked two to three times! Fail!
bad,"Lack of grow, only close friends will get an opportunity to advance , they spend money on trainers working from home , not enough help staffing stores"
bad,"I process payroll, attendance, human resources , talent acquisition, employee relations, training and administering discipline and reviews.  The best part of the job was the people you got to work with at some points.  The culture is very dependent on who the store director and regional director are"
bad,"they want employees to work so hard they tire out and hurt themselves. pay and management sucks, no benefit and you'll get written up for anything kf jglbkh"
bad,"If you dont feel good about the atmosphere of your particular store, do not apply. At sprouts its all about the quality of your coworkers and bosses, like them and the job is for you."
bad,This place sucks....I cut myself a couple times i mean deep  ones all they'd let me do is put a bandage on it...then i couldn't work nights they put me on nights....i absolutely hated it
bad,"Sprouts seems like it would be a fun place to work and that they would treat their employees fairly and offer good benefits.  Not true"
bad,"The job starts off ok, told from the get go that you’ll move up, but no. They play favorites and never listen to what needs to be done. They’ll take advantage of you and cut your hours little by little, after asking you to do even more, oh and within your time frame because no one else will help you so stuff will be there to finish tomorrow. There’s no incentives. And even their HR team doesn’t help. I tried turning to them on 2 separate occasions and nothing. This company DOES NOT have your back. They are all very, very two faced."
bad,"I helped open a new location and it really was a poor experience. I wouldn't wish working there upon my worst enemies. They said they treated their employees well and with equal respect but, that was so far from the truth. I was scheduled on all the hours the Dairy Manager was not and when I asked for one on one training with the Grocery Manager as they suggested. The manager refused to patiently work with me I went to the store manager and requested to change my hours work with the Dairy Manager and she told me she couldn't. I was very sorely disappointed and left."
bad,"Wasted over a year of my life and devoted all my resume to a loss cause. Asked to come in when I requested time off. Assisted other associates without any recognition. Also, management is very self focused on their success."
bad,From the first day to the last day sprouts in Norman was chaos.  It is truly worse than high school with the petty stuff. The store manager acts like an oligarch.
bad,"The overall experience has been for overwhelming. This company constantly send people home early , cuts hours . There are no advancement opportunities, sex discrimination, as well as other issues of this nature. This company does not promote from within and lays off middle management or demotes them after years of service. This job only good for second job not primary.  Also favoritism ..Love my coworkers ."
bad,Worst place to work.Managers act like they are God.Micromanage but no responsibility. Corparate is useless. No training or help from managers.More rules every week so they can get rid of you if they don't like you.
bad,the department manager would drop meat on the floor and thin pick it up and put it in the grinder with the rest of the meat fish was not stored in a cool environment and this would be soled to customers it was disgusting.
bad,"Sprouts does not work around your schedule very well, and if you are able to get a schedule that fits around your life they will give you as little hours as possible. "
bad,trash is only thing that can explain what i knew i woke up to and had to go be around all day worst place i have ever worked expects way to much for doing
bad,"Terrible company to work for. Management chain is backwards and corporate offices sees number and not humans working of the company, couldn't care less about anything going on at stores."
bad,"I spent three and a half years at Sprouts Farmers Market in Lemon Grove, California. I learned quite a bit about leading a healthy lifestyle and continue to practice these methods as I continue on my journey of life."
bad,"simple job but no reward also no room to advance, bulk clerk filling bulk bins with dried foods checking prices answering phones and maintaining cleanliness of the bulk area."
bad,The only way to get fired from this job is absences. They allow their workers to bully and assault you. I have never dealt with such difficult workers in my whole life.
bad,"Everything that you can possible think of that's wrong this company does it. None of upper management have a clue of what they are doing, never enough help, threatened by anyone with a brain."
bad,"The front end is filled with nothing but drama, I luckily advanced after being there for a couple months. Working beneath Management was no better. Now that the Sprouts Farmers Market is under new management it’s even worst. Store manager does nothing but expects you to do and complete everything. Theyre too busy taking smoke breaks to actually work or care. Rules were not adhered to for years and once new management came about it was implemented all at once, causing complete and total chaos. You’re just another number to management, they will not hesitate to write you up or fire you for petty things."
bad,Let this job be your starting ground unless you’re trying to stagnate in your career. Sprouts turnover can be a bit high especially with unprofessional management.
bad,Hazardous work environment. No help when injured. Managers yelled constantly at employees. If you feel we weren’t allowed to fill out a form about injuries
bad,I worked here for a year-and-a-half and never received a review or raise. At first you would get 40 hours a week and then they would cut you all the way down to 25 hours a week even though we were always short-staffed and never had enough employees in the store.
bad,I hired on in the meat department as an entry level employee. Was put through meat cutter apprentice program was told I would get a promotion with benefits when I graduated from the program. Never happened. Anytime they tell you anything never believe it. The company will cut your hours in a heart beat. All they care about is money. Doesnt matter if your running non stop and your department is blown out no help. Get yelled at if you get any overtime that's not approved and even if it is they will still make you cut it. Stay away as an employee
bad,"Night crew would leave some kind of mess or use up items for morning crew"
bad,I enjoy the workplace in general however the management team is biased and the employees are unprofessional. They're great on giving customer attention but dont give the same attention to their employees when needed.
bad,I was told I was going to be the new back up receiving supervisor with a nice raise. This was supposed to be as of July 2nd however it is July 24th as I write this with no raise/ no promotion. I just feel used and abused as I am doing the job with my old pay.
bad,"Working at Sprouts farmer's Market sucks!! When I first started working at Sprouts I would get between 30 and 40 hours.  Which was awesome,  I started to notice that when Sprouts changed management the company started to decrease the number of hours they gave their employees in every department.  Now I barely get between 20 and 30 hours on a good week.  Department managers, head cashiers, administrative coordinators, and still get 40+ hours, but when it comes to regular employees who do the grunt work you get the shaft."
bad,i worked here for two years and the management doesn't know what they're doing. they treat their employees badly. unfair work environment that makes you feel unappreciated.
bad,I can say that I got better with the cash register. The company wasn't bad working for but do not get enough hours. I did not agree with not being able to advance
bad,"Worked here for about a year and really did enjoy it at first. Most the managers were nice, but incompetent when it came to their duties."
bad,"As a company they really don't care about your life, if they do care then your one of the lucky ones. They want you to make your job your life and sprouts culture your number one choice. Before they went corporate the company was great but now not so much."
bad,"management sucks, the employees are lazy and often try to tear you down so they look better. hard workers are not rewarded the way they should be. there is no jobsecurity, the current manager has been recorded multiple times saying ""if you dont like it, theres the door""."
bad,No room for growth and are paid unlivable wages. Corporate greed has set in and there is no value for employees and the work they put in.
bad,"I was given a ""full time"" job there that was supposed to be guaranteed 40 hrs a week. After starting my first week there, which was only 20 hrs, they cut my hours back to about 4-8 hours a week. I constantly complained to only hear, ""we were short on sales this week, so wait until next week"" only to have more and more hours cut each week until I was barely even working anymore. "
bad,As a manager you are forced to make a schedule with few hours to have a full time job and have full coverage with the rest of your department staff. You constantly have to change the marketing to fit schematic and even then the schematics are wrong when your store is not built like the rest of the stores. I am not sure how it is now but based on my experience at Sprouts FM I did not feel compesated from my time.
bad,"This place sucks to work at. The management makes not only the employees but the customers feel stupid. The management chews tobacco on the job, and is very rude. I worked here for a year and never got a raise, promotion, and only got one review. When i told them i was leaving they never let me write my two week notice down and claimed i called in the entire week that I was scheduled. Through out the year that i worked here they constantly made me cashier but never paid me cashier pay. And kept my title as ""bagger"". THIS PLACE SUCKS."
bad,Place sucks! Horribly mismanaged and over worked for little pay! They say that you can move up easily but that's a lie. Most often the managers are inexperienced!
bad,Worse company I’ve ever worked for. The favoritism is out of this world and the discrimination coming from the store manager and her assistant non perishable manager was out of this world. If you are an butt kisser then this place is for you. They give the hours to their favorites. All they cared about was bonus. They would send you home to cut payroll and then write you up if you had any type of overtime they only did this with certain people. Don’t put yourself through it like I did people.
bad,pass two background checks after getting hired but when I was up for a promotion they fired me because I failed a background check. WTF?They had no explanation for why I passed the first two but not the last one.
bad,"Out of all the jobs, I've ever worked this place will always hold a special place in my heart. It would've been the perfect job if all tiers of management weren't as hostile or incompetent as they were. Whether it was the Store manager talking behind people's back or department managers unwilling to listen to team members they always found a way to make the job unbearable."
bad,My manager was a complete idiot. Had no grocery back ground. Didn't know the business. All my managers were ftom restaurant's. Hello no grocery experience.
bad,Getting away with ruining people's lives.. no care nor concern for their employees... you can see in their faces they're miserable in their own lives and could care less about the store
bad,"Too many employees, not enough hours. No seniority. Management does NOT have your back when customers are Wrong. Changing of store managers and department managers are often. Not enough communication between store and employees. New employees getting promoted while long-term employees get left behind. ALOT OF FAVORITISM."
bad,"The job itself is fun, management is a joke, they are lazy and play favorites. They take away your hours in a heartbeat like you don't have bills to pay too, and nothing you do is ever good enough, and all you hear is negative feedback. The pay is ridiculous for breaking your back every day."
bad,It’s completely disorganized. They don’t care about not having enough people. They fire good people. They want you to do so much. But won’t gelo you out. They don’t care about anything besides making money. They lie about advancing you just to keep you there when they have no intention of doing so.
bad,The assistant managers are good. Very friendly and helpful. The store manager is the complete opposite. The attitude of the workplace isn't great. Simply because it starts from the store manager and flows down to the associates.
bad,"Mornings as a Head Cashier:"
bad,"A company that supports illegal work activity, maintains a poor workplace culture, and is completely green-washed. Management is transactional with subordinate interaction rather than leading with inspirational intent. Employee engagement is low, and turnover is way beyond the common standard in retail."
bad,High stress environment. Little to no support. Poor management training. The people that work in the stores are top notch. The leadership is evasive and lazy
bad,"Very political. If you're not in the managers Little ""clique"" forget about getting hours, learning new things or advancing. Its a popularity contest. Ok for a first job."
bad,"It's sad to say that your favorite local grocery store is a disorganized, neglegent mess. But even sadder still is the few stars in that company that run the day to day operations that are stuck in a rut. Who, when they worked hard to move up into a better position are told by the store manager that they need to step down to there old position and take a pay cut. Or placing one person in charge of an entire department and not giving them a promotion, no training, no help, and lofty expectations. Scheduling employees in your department and having them work in other departments because the other department doesn't have the hours.... Just stay away..."
bad,"Expect a lot of responsibilities to fall on you if someone else doesn't complete them, as well as four different managers coming to tell you how you messed up if you did something wrong. If they aren't fully staffed, just don't apply. They will stress out and take it all out on you, but will threaten to fire you if you let your stress show at work. Look for a fast-food job before applying here, you'll have less expected of you for the pay you're getting."
bad,"You work hard to impress and you work hard to improve your skill. The management dose not care about how hard or Long you work they do not give you the opportunity to move up in the company, but they are very good liars. Not all the management is like that at sprouts just most of it."
bad,"i already had management experience from working at whole foods market for 12 years."
bad,Never enough help and one person was easily overwhelmed by all the work that is involved in a meat department with a skeleton crew. Consistently having to apologize to guests for not having enough product. The company hired young and inexperienced managers.
bad,"Working for Sprouts is a nightmare of degradation, micromanagement,  and penny pinching. They cut your hours so bad that any vacation time you have accrued goes to making up for those lost hours,  so good luck ever getting vacation with this company.  They only take care of management above 3rds and treat everyone below them horribly."
bad,"Poor training in the bakery, a lot of mistakes and the closer always gets to do all the morning and day shift clean ups and leave it intentionally. A lot of complaints on pies not cooked fully and over and undercooked pastries.  Everyone cooks different.  They higher a new manager and we was not introduce to her. This department doses not have meetings to work thru concerns they just talk about you and disrespect your position and as a person.  If you not a timely person they look down on you badly and suspend you for being late or tardy.  They a 7mins grace period and uses it against you no matter how you work. The store manager will handle issues that HR should be doing which I found odd."
bad,"I've worked there for over 1 yr. and I don't find it getting  any easier. "
bad,The past was horrible compared to the stress encountered. I went through disrespect not only from customers but also management.  There's allot of favoritism that comes with this job.
bad,Sprouts offered lots of benefits at training and when we started our hours were cut from 25 to 6 to 8 a week. The pay was more than most stores but the hours were not there. I stayed as long as I could to make it work and never moved from 15 hours.
bad,There is little to no job advancement opportunities. Management was terrible and mean to their employees.  you can tell no one likes to work here and the days drag by.  I would not recommend working here to anyone unless you cannot find anything else.
bad,"Sprouts is a grocery store masquerading as a health food store. They don't treat the employees well, they under pay them and work them into the ground. The moral is low and the under tone of the work force is ungrateful and not friendly. Sunflower was a better company."
bad,"The job itself was easy. My coworkers were awesome. However, hours are low and it the store is over budget or not making sales(which always happens) they ask you to go home"
bad,"This company favors customers but employees are dispensable, policies constantly being changed, they offer very little pay for what is required of you, it is obvious that the management does not care about employee morale."
bad,"The people are the best part of this job. The management does not communicate with one another and work items change constantly. Everyone hears information separately and shares separately. I would only work here if I were a student, or planning on gaining experience. If you're a favorite and can keep up with gossip, you will move up quickly."
bad,"They always want more, but they offer nothing in return. No good pay increases, no worth while benefits and very disrespectful managers.Would never suggest this company to anyone for a job or shopping experience."
bad,"Management was so unorganized and I received no training whatsoever yet i was constantly insulted by management to other employees saying ""That new floral girl sucks."" Hours were constantly changing I went 2 weeks with only having 4 hours. Your hours for the week depends on sales the previous week. No one could have a steady salary working there."
bad,"New store, did great the first couple of weeks but now it's struggling, so hours are being cut. You can't really live that well on 12 hours a week at $9 and hour but management doesn't care. If you complain you get cut even further. Managers don't care to know your name unless you flirt with them. Which is the only way you get recognition at this particular store. You could be swamped with customers and need help but the manager has your back up in the office talking about movies and pie, then that person sitting and talking will get a reward for excellent service. HR lady is absolutely useless. After 3 months direct deposit still hasn't gone through and all she says is it takes time, THREE MONTHS!!  Regional comes in and could not care less to ask if there are any issues in the store. The idea of this store is great. Healthy living for less, but the way you get it for less is low wages, no hours, and exceptionally poor management."
bad,My day is exactly the same day after day. I do not like it and that is why I am trying to find a new job.
bad,upper management is unsure of desired finished product on a daily bases. what looks good one day will change the next. spuratic moral degration of work performance or department conditions from various uppermanagement levels. what one manager might be praising another at same time could be degrading. has high expectations of individuals job performance but does not offer the tools or man power to realistically achieve any standard. company hand book is also very broad based and leaves to much open to corporate self interpertation.
bad,"I was awarded a few times and quit on good terms. With that said, Sprouts was a terrible company to work for. The management at my location was embarrassingly lazy, harsh, and inconsiderate to any of the workers. There was zero advancement opportunity, and the only reason Sprouts is expanding rapidly is through paying their specialized workers minimum wage, denying promised raises, and offering paltry benefits. A typical day was harsh and long, but I didn't mind the work. My co-workers were great, and my immediate supervisor was even greater. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the multitude of work that was completed at the end of the day, and the hardest was listening to the belittling,disrespectful, and inconsiderate upper management. I know many good workers who have quit for this very reason."
bad,I started off on the front end and moved to scan then was recruited to meat. The goal was to move me to assistant manager of the meat department. I went through the apprenticeship which was great. As soon as my promotion from clerk to cutter went through I was promised by my perishable manager she was going to put a push through to advance me to assistant in a couple weeks They ended up hiring this guy with like 10 years experience and that promise went away real fast. they went back on their promise and say they never made the promise  they did this to any other employee and promoted someone else over her when she was promised a promotion. Our store manager at 173 has a funky way of dealing with things and is always in a bad mood on Mondays and takes it out on everyone. The management also gets really mad when people call out. Like you have to have a doctors note for it to be legit.
bad,"The company is rated #6 in a USA Today survey of the 18 worst companies to work for.  That says it all. It fit the old addage that says ""the beatings will continue until morale improves"".  Sprouts upper management lives by that credo."
bad,"Sprouts treats you like a slave. I have never been in more physical pain from a job. They overwork you, say that you can’t have water while you are working and treat you like you are stealing when you are taking home groceries you have purchased. There are hundreds of flies that have infested every corner of the store that has not been addressed for weeks. Disgusting! They expect same work results during open store hours shift as overnight. That is impossible because you are constantly assisting guests during the day and working in a endless state of interruption. They insist on you having paid stickers on every item you purchased but don’t ensure that paid stickers are stocked in the register for the cashiers to use. They have a ridiculous point system and will mark employees no call no show when they have called in for a shift. Middle management is not very professional and many of the employees are childish, unprofessional, cursing on the floors and worse.  Head management is cold and uncaring, unaware of the actual work the hardworking employees are actually doing."
bad,"All dept employess were great as well as most of the dept managers but the ""core four"" are pretty much invisible. They are either sitting in an office or walking around on their phones. Zero communication. I was sick and had to call out and had to call 4 different times to get a ""core four"" on the phone. Good for a school kid or retired person. Not a career store"
bad,"They will guaranteed underpay you and they really don't care about you. Management and regular employees are a revolving door making the place run constantly by people who are inexperienced or poorly trained. They do not allow time for proper training and honestly, they can barely keep department managers around. We cycled through 6 grocery managers during my time there."
bad,"For 5 years it was great, due to store managers who are hired, but fired from the previous employer, it went downhill quickly.  Back stabbing culture now with low ethics, looking for scape goats. You will do well if you suck at your job and blame others.."
bad,"Management was buddy buddy with specific coworkers, and they got the most shifts. Others had to fight for whatever time was left (my average hours were less than 12 a week, with full availability). Tons of drama between coworkers because they hired mostly people aged 18-21. I personally came in working hard every shift, and it became my downfall because no one else cared about their jobs, so I was made to do the work of 2 or even 3 people while the others lounged around doing literally nothing. Managers also purposefully didn’t staff enough people, and then expect everything to get done in the same time it would with twice as many workers. People often would leave the dirty work from their shift for the shift after theirs(dirty bathrooms, overflowing trash, tons of carts), and it was targeted at the people they disliked. The week I was hired the pay was raised from $10 an hour to $15 an hour, so those who were already employed were paid more to continue doing subpar work.  The managers also did not fire anyone, you had to do something really horrible to be let go; but continued to hire more people and continued to cut hours more and more. Some weeks I wouldn’t even get hours unless I begged people to contact me first if they were in need of their shift covered. Horrible job."
bad,"Any question, whether it’s about hours, pay raise or serious concern, is always answered with “I’ll look into it.” Management is unreliable. They have Zero follow through."
bad,Sprouts doesn't care about their employees. They only care about money and everyone is a just a number who is easily replaced. Corporate office is not team member friendly. They complain about there jobs and are not there to problem solve or help any employee.The turn over rate is extremely high.
bad,"Non unionized, felt like favoritism was used toward promotions for management positions. Hours are are inconsistent, could not plan off days due to off days being random, no set schedule"
bad,"Management cuts hours without warning, as well as constantly cycling, eliminating all chances for upward movement in the company. There is no communication between management and the employees."
bad,"Management does nothing to benefit their stores. God forbid you call out for personal reasons or being sick, they look down on you at that point because then they're actually forced to do something for a change instead of micro managing everyone else. No opportunity for advancement, no benefits, they pay you the bare minimum for doing more work than the store manager does. This store would not run without the hard working employees there. The ""managers"" wouldn't have anyone to manage and they'd be out of a job if the real workers decided to leave. Also expect anyone and everyone there to talk smack about you behind your back. Secrets spread like wildfire there."
bad,Worked at store 704 people who worked there were great management on the other was horrible so micro managed and when you had an issue no one to help you not even the store manager he sends you on down the line to his assistance manager to take of the problem or just straight up lie to your face and say I will take care of it and never does it I started as cashier and then moved to scanning was promised full time hours and title change which never happened even tho I had been doing scanning and was scanning when I asked Michael Gray the assistant when I was going to get all that was promised he told I didn’t qualify till I have been six months there and I would not be getting retro pay either when I spoke to store manager he said he would take care it never happened it’s such a shame because Sprouts can be a better place to work if it weren’t for such lousy management unfortunately I had to quit because that’s another thing they do is play with your schedule cut hours because they need to save on payroll was told that also when I asked why so little hours but when they need you then it’s ok to get hours too many head games they play
bad,"The hiring motto for Sprouts, is ""Come Grow With Us."" That is very far from the truth. After working 2 years for Sprouts, and receiving a 4.5 out of 5 on my last performance review, I took the Back Up Administrative Coordinator position with the location in Fort Worth. They Lowered my salary simply because they stated the ""program"" they use that calculates for new or changing position salary changes, came back that the back up admin (who is in charge of counting money, balancing the daily books, payroll, and a position that has access to All employee personal information) does not pay as much as a person who hands out samples, which is the position I had before the back up admin."
bad,"Not super fun, but really easy. Management doesn't care about you due to the incredibly high turnover rate. Pay is paltry, benefits are flung at you in a notebook and the nothing is ever explained."
bad,"A typical work day was full of more stress than needed. You did the job of four other people but was paid poorly. Management however was terrible, even after multiple complaints about how rude the main manager was being, nothing was done about it. The employees are nothing to Sprouts it felt like, I was not important to the company. I would never recommend this company."
bad,"I had high hopes for a business based on healthy living but the upper management expects an unreasonable amount of work from overworked employees while being terribly understaffed. Expecting the work of three employees from just one is the norm and you are brutally criticized for not presenting a perfect and well-stocked department. Go to any Sprouts at any time and you will find numerous out of stock items, some empty shelves and long lines. The purchasing system is inefficient and a company with nearly 300 stores should utilize technology for inventory management and automated purchasing. Most employees do care and work hard to keep up but professionalism and support diminishes the farther up you go in management."
bad,"The customers at Sprouts are amazing and the work is enjoyable, however management support is lacking.  Advancement is not easy as managers are incredibly bias.  Benefits are adequate provided you can get full time hours."
bad,"class system for benefits is old school and unfair, only management is considered full time and therefor they are not only paid significantly better they get better benefits such as PTO, Medical, Holiday pay, hours worked."
bad,"I learned the importance of being the face of a store and the importance of maintaining customer satisfaction. Overall, I would say that it was good experience for my future and the skills I learned will definitely be applicable in my future."
bad,"I loved Sprouts when I first started, it was family oriented and we got raises and reviews every 3 months.  Once they opened more and more stores and became corporate, there was a high turnover in all stores and only annual, small raises."
bad,"Do not work here. It is completely one sided and only based on who the manager likes more. Not who works the hardest or who does the best work. Pay is also based on favoritism and not on what people should be getting. Also, If they promise you a raise after 6 months, or a certain number of hours. Do not believe them because it will never come. They do not stay true to their word."
bad,Management was probably the worst I’ve ever seen in my career...the store itself looked pretty good most of the time but that was because of the people like myself working there who cared.
bad,"No advancement, poor salary/wadges. I always needed help and the management were ""Helpful"" but did nothing. Management blew on the bread cutter and never washed her hands."
bad,"imagine spending eight hours on your feet roughly reciting a script over and over. you can sometimes exchange a few words with the customers but you need to keep that to a minimum same with your fellow employees. if your closing you need to clean the front end and in the morning get there early the stores relying on you and people will be there trying to buy stuff on the dot. Don't clock in too early or late you got a slight window after like 5-7 minutes late you may get away with but don't make it a habit. Keep all of this in mind and do your best to be helpful to those around you and you will do fine. "
bad,"its a shame to work for a company who values their customers but when it comes to the employees they couldn't give a rats bottom. I called out sick a few times and my department manager cut my hours from 37.5 hours a week to 1-2 days a week. So basically you have to suck up to your manager, which in my opinion should not have to happen to work somewhere."
bad,"quick job if you're in need of a pay check to pay check, nowhere near organised and professionalism what so ever... i just hope you have a back up plan when ish gets real"
bad,"decent pay, but close to no hours 'available' though they can hire a bunch of bodies to work. Requesting hours in different departments gets you nowhere as the store doesn't have a ""Labor Budget"" to accomidate the workers attempting to make the effort to support their families."
bad,"No Leadership, No Direction, Old reports, Vents Covered in nasty mold/ Black Mold on shelves, Tons of expired dates on the shelves and terrible re-tension, one of the worst I have ever seen"
bad,Management in the district very poor.  Don't speak nice to regular employees.  Talk down like you are below average.  When you have a question or need depending on how it affects the office time they are quick to put you on back burner.  I was cleared for a transfer due to a geographical move.  The office in Sunnyvale failed to contact the new store to communicate I would be on board.  The system adding match the availability.  I had to move back to Sunnyvale forcing me to be homeless in my car.
bad,When I first got hired the management had hired too many people and I barely got any hours. There was not good communication betwee employing management either.
bad,Overall Sprouts is a great place to work.  The best part for me was working with the public and giving the best customer service I could.
bad,"The job it self is good but the management is horrible, you aren't scheduled for any hours even if you have open availability. management is not good at all. there is an extremely high turnover rate because the employees are treated bad."
bad,"I rarely ever write reviews, but working at Sprouts has been an awful experience for me. First of all, they didn't train me(and many of the other new cashiers) they handed me a booklet and through me to the wolves. I was hired on part time but was worked 40 hours a week(I was totally fine with that) but I did not get any benefits along with no holiday pay. In the beginning I was willing to work any schedule and that was fine. I got consecutive days off and regular hours. But once I voiced concerns or said anything that my manager didn't like I was basically ""punished"". One week I had to work 6 days out of my week but I was worked under 40. Then I asked to not close anymore due to transportation and the following week I was dropped from 40 hours to 9 hours, both 4:30 hour shifts being close shifts. Management is childish and only cares about themselves. They expect their employees to do the inevitable with a smile on our faces. I'm so glad I left."
bad,"Due to unyielding management, employees quit often. Schedules changed weekly, no consistent or consecutive days off. When I became ill with a chronic disease and wanted to go part time, they forced me out. Human Resources never returned my calls. I had 6 store managers in 5 years, which should say something about the working conditions. Glad to not be there anymore!!"
bad,"Between being regularly told you are replaceable and corporate telling managers to keep your hours to under the amount needed for benefits this place does not care about its employees or how they feel. In the years I worked there we had over 70% turn over as a grocery store, so that says something."
bad,It's an ok job but depends on the managment roster and your ability to navigate back room politics. Expect to be faced with over impossible expectations and to be overworked because your department will be understaffed. Don't expect any support if you want to be promoted.
bad,"I learned a lot about meat and fish by working in the fish department, also education on all the organic and other healthy lifestyle foods"
bad,Working at sprouts made it very difficult to have a life outside of work. They are very hard on people who do anything outside of work. It was great though to learn great customer service and meet people with healthy eating habits.
bad,Was hired part time but scheduled full time work. Schedule was always overlapping with my school schedule which was very inconvenient. Management was not there half the time and sometimes extremely rude to employees. Sometimes breaks were skipped because Front End Managers cannot multitask.
bad,"Management needs to learn to be more fair, not everyone is treated equally and the consequences are never the same for the same behavior. Many times employees are not promoted within and people are brought in from other stores for the position. Co-workers are cool for the most part."
bad,"No chance to take time off because there are not enough people cross-trained. When requesting vacations, managers give employees attitude. They want us to work are buns off and give us large amounts of tasks but we can NEVER get overtime"
bad,"At first the Job is great, fun and exciting! Then everything takes a 180 and there is not enough employees around to help out leaving the rest to everyone else to pick up slack. The advancement is none and pay is terrible."
bad,"Your houston stores are a total flop.  If your not a whole foods knock off and male you can't make it in tnis company. Nothing is ever good enough. Your set up for failure and given no support. Dedicated employees are abused.  Displinary actions are sporadically enforced.  Late, no-show, drunk or high management able to turn a blind eye. You are made to work off the clock to benefit and make store manager look good. Very sad Houston has been allowed to be taken over by WF leftovers.  They took a team of passionate people and told ""don't be so passionate""  very sad."
bad,"I worked with this company for 8 months and it was definitely a learning experience as well as a waste of time. The store as far as product wise was very nice, a lot of fresh and healthy things to offer, but employees and management was way below standard. Management did not have store or schedule properly organized. Received several complaints from customers, schedule had to constantly be changed, always short handed on front-end, bakery, and deli. When employees would ask questions to management they would be rude and misunderstanding. I tried to help out as much as I could, anywhere I could, but still was treated disrespectfully."
bad,"I've never felt so under-valued and so easily replaceable in all of my life. My job experience is irrelevant. I'm treated like i'm incompetent and spoken to like a child. Things are repeated to me multiple times and followed with a ""don't let me down."" I've never had positive feedback, only negative. All the positive points that the interviewer sold me on turned out to be not true. I knew I should have run away when I got paid .50 cents less than what was initially discussed. I was told they would work with my school schedule but that was far from the truth. "
bad,"Workers were nice, friendly and fun to work with. The management was absolutely horrific. They don't really seem to care about your outside life and schedule you for about 8 to 12 hours with 1-2 15 minute breaks or 2 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute break."
bad,"I have learned that no matter how much you get done it is never good enough.There is a big turnover in employees, and department managers.The hardest part of the job is getting product and supplies in that you need to work with."
bad,No flexibility shifts. There’s three main shifts and you will literally change daily which shift your working. They worry more about having money in there pockets. So we are consistently short staffed. Hard to get breaks and lunches for the front end on time. They expect too much for what we get paid. Schedule doesn’t come out till two days before it starts which gives no time to plan anything for the week. I don’t  recommend if you want to have a good work life balance or decent pay.
bad,"They expect one person to do the job of two, with the least amount of hours to do it in. They encourage people to blindly follow instead of creativity."
bad,"I really wanted to love working here, however the high turnover rate and poor scheduling were what overall made me quit. There were some good managers, but overall corporate had the last say in scheduling, so we were often left high and dry on busy days with not enough employees. Also, as a supervisor I was scheduled terrible hours, often closing the store (sometimes until 11-12 AM) and then opening the subsequent day (6:45 AM). This overall was really stressful for me and made it a horrible work place."
bad,The management at Sprouts was very distant and i consistent. There was very little if any feedback or communication between management and employees who were not “management.” Difficult to advance unless you knew someone “personally.”
bad,"I worked at Sprouts for three weeks, maybe four. I thought it was going to be fun working there, but most employees were not friendly., that was a bummer. There’s a lot of work to do, however, that shouldn’t stop anyone from acknowledging you. The work is tedious but easy to do. I never have worked in an environment where coworkers don’t say hi!  “Good morning, good afternoon, how are you or even hey” are nice to hear. "
bad,If you only want part time ot will work. Pay is minimal and management changes often. Training is minimal as well. Not much consideration for seniority.
bad,"This job good for school students/retirees or only as a supplemental income type job. You will be doing stocking with minimal direction and no help, expect to be called off your break to customer assist due to lack of staffing. Mgmt doesn't care about your development as you are easily replaceable. Online training modules are supposed to be done during your work shift, but never given time to do them so you are forced to do on your off time in order to complete them by the due date. Mgmt's idea of saving on payroll (reducing all non-mgmt staff) so they can get a bigger bonus, results in customers not getting attention and some departments are unattended for hours."
bad,"This is by far the WORST company I have ever worked for. The management doesn’t know what they’re doing, they have ZERO customer service, they tell you lies to get the job, and they’re sexist."
bad,"Inconsistent top management in primary role at store. Constant changes in direction and expectations. The store(s) hire great team members, but poor communication and unorganized training leads to retention problems."
bad,"It's hard to be motivated to work hard and go the extra mile when the hourly rate is so low, and raises are minimal. There is no sense of teamwork and no incentive to do better."
bad,"If you are looking for any kind of personal satisfaction or fulfillment look elsewhere. This is only a temporary JOB, anyone who makes this permanent employment will become resentful they did. There is no employee appreciation, they treat everyone like children. You are just a number here and can be replaced at any time."
bad,Favoritisms and drama unfold here. Don’t expect a pay raise and don’t expect employers to protect you from harassment from other employees or customers.
bad,"The pay at Sprouts is terrible. Management doesnt care. The one who do never stay very long. Ive watched a lot of good people get worked into the ground. Had to leave because there was no money in it. And no chance of anymore. Raises are annual amd are only 2% of what you currently make. Which makes for not a very stable financial situation for most adults. I did love the team meber appreciation weeks. Thise are a lot of fun. I loved some of my managers very much. But the core four, as they are called, are not cool. Theres also this really weird not cool clique. And major favoritism. Blantant right in your face. And its a total boys club. Which sucks. I also didn't appreciate being called sweetheart and pumpkin."
bad,"Sprouts would probably be a great place to work if it wasn't for the management. At the Harvard location in Tulsa, I felt like I had to walk on eggshells for fear that my manager would get upset about something and go off on me in front of customers. It happened on such a regular basis, that for the short period of time I was employed there two cashiers quit. Management gave them such bad anxiety they found it difficult to do their job. Managers are so stressed out that it makes it almost hostile to work there because everyone is on edge 100% of the time. Head Cashiers are consistently given more supervisory responsibilities without an increase in pay, all because the managers want to cut labor so they get their end of year bonuses. Who cares about how much youre overworking and underpaying your employees if youre getting paid for it, right? Ugh. Its too bad, because otherwise I wouldve really enjoyed being with the company and probably wouldve stayed much longer than I did. They dont release schedules until 2 or 3 days before the schedule starts, and schedules are so wildly different each week that it makes it impossible to plan anything. It forces you to constantly have to request off for every little thing you need to do outside of work. I would not recommend working for Sprouts because if they promote individuals to a GM position that treat their employees this way, then I can only imagine Tulsa isnt the only location like that."
bad,Very hard work never seems to be enough time in the day.  Work a minimum of 10 hours per day.  10 years in management and still working nights and weekends.
bad,"dont work there, not a stable enviroment at all. job security is none existent and you will always be stressed. well maybe it was just my location in germantown"
bad,"Hours suck but the environment is good overall. Management could use some improvement, respect employees, knowledge at Sprouts is a little lackluster."
bad,Bad Upper Management..need to say no more...really they cut throat and cheat people out...the company is good I believe the culture is fun but they turned it into a mess definitely want what I expected
bad,"Will hire anybody for a job, makes promises but doesn’t keep them, have to keep up with them about pay advancements will delay you, it’s like a  dysfunctional families"
bad,"Corporate doesn’t care about individuals or even the individual needs of each store. The new program is unhelpful and causes too much shrink and the big bosses STILL find a way to blame the department managers. From regional managers up, no one cares. It’s run so poorly and they don’t even see it."
bad,"Sprouts is an okay place to work, i dont recommend it to anyone. pay is okay but for the amount of work you do and what they company ""stands for"" it should be higher pay than is given. company cares too much about number than actually taking care of their employees, giving 1 day a week is just wrong."
bad,"Upper management moves up their favorites regardless of who is most qualified . "
bad,Would not recommend for a career oppounitiy.  LAck of training and developing associates and managers to succeed.  They don't look at what you are qualified to do its based off of who you know in the company to be promoted up futher in the company.
bad,"Poor management, pay."
bad,"I worked  there for a year and it was awful (the worst placed i have ever worked)"
bad,"If corporate allowed 50 hours per week to fulfill department duties and meet customer service, expect to do it with only 35 hours, because management only cares about their own bonuses.  "
bad,"Typical day would include cutting meat as needed for the shelves, cleaning and customer service. Management is disorganized and it is slow to advance to the next rank. I have learned how to cut various types of meat and various styles of cutting. The workplace culture is stressful because there are particular team members within the department that do not do their job as requested by other members such as cleaning and proper handling of food. The hardest part is trying to keep the department clean and organized when others will not. The most enjoyable part is learning new meat cutting skills and knowledge of the product."
bad,"Management is horrible, no clear direction for your job duties, very high turnover rate. They hire new people and expect them to just jump in with no proper training. The only positive thing is the 15% discount. Pay is very low and no opportunities for raises other than once a year and they are very small. Steer clear of Sprouts, you will thank me!"
bad,"Front end is most difficult department, most people that are hired don't pull their weight and are young kids. mangers are goofing off in the office or will assume someone else will get the code 1 call. expected to fulfill front end duties and help other departments on top of that."
bad,"i helped manage not only the vitamin section but i also was helping in all the sections to help others and lead them to having a successful day. I would not only help organize and to get product on the shelf but clean and do inventory and help in meat, produce, bakery, deli, dairy, backroom stalking, unloading trucks, customer service, grocery. I basically made it so i knew how to do all aspects of the store so i could better help the company."
bad,"I worked in the bulk department and it was severely understaffed, only four people including myself. The job is extremely physical, unloading pallets and boxes, lifting 25-50 lbs regularly, constantly crouching and bending over, and refilling the 100+ bulk bins several times a day with large bags that you have to tie up or tape after every use is a huge pain, especially with customers always in the way and interrupting you with questions that don't involve your department. We were also responsible for stocking the coffee aisle, the end cap and large table areas next to the bulk aisles that were stocked with pre-packaged goods, and the bulk spices, and were overall spread way too thin with an unrealistic work load. And to top it off I was only paid 9.70 an hour and asked twice in my first week to work 10+ hour days because they were so understaffed. Absolutely do not recommend."
bad,"It's just a grocery store job. there is in insanely high turnover rate. in my experience coworkers were not interested in forming bonds, and the management was also against forming bonds between coworkers which made it a little desolate."
bad,"I witnessed retaliation, favoritism, unfair treatment and many more things that made it tough for employees who work in the stores. Ethics hotline contacted by several employees and nothing seems to ever be thoroughly investigated to remedy the management issues. As long as they're making their $ numbers, senior store managers appear to be untouchable while the worker bees get reprimanded regularly causing turnover and involuntary terminations regularly."
bad,"There is absolutely no appreciation while working there. It is all about who you suck up to. If you become best friends with the SM, ASM, S3 & S4 then you're good. Otherwise you matter to no one. The store manager was more concerned with showing his favorite employees pictures of his vacations, or things he just bought for his house etc...."
bad,"We are short staffed in a couple departments including mine and they aren't willing to hire anyone. Managers do not like to help out with anything. Co-Workers are fun to be around and talk to while at work. I'd say the only department that may be easy going and much less stressful and hectic, is the front end - cashier."
bad,"Sprouts has been awful to work for. Between management which shows no respect for their employees, and some of the worst hours yo-yo I've seen, I can not recommend working for Sprouts in any capacity."
bad,"They are a good company to buy from, but it's not a place to work for and have a job. the pay is low and expect a lot from you. They want you to do a lot of work say if you are in the bulk station they expect you to fill all bins and help customers and while cleaning the bins to."
bad,"The job it self is not hard, and the other naggers in the department are young so gossip is rampant. Management sucks and picks favorites. What they really want is someone who has no life and makes working there a top priority. They will work with school schedules which is a plus but don't expect to work more than 20 hours a week"
bad,"Horrible MANAGEMENT."
bad,"I worked for Sprouts for 5 years, giving it my all. My schedule was never consistent. They would schedule a 2-10pm shift and then the next morning a 7am- 3:30pm, 10 days in a row on and then 1 day off. They used me up and burned me out like a broke back old donkey. I worked so much, under extreme stress and became physically ill. I told my manager that i was diagnosed with an illness and needed to work less hours. Sprouts solution...""you can step down from your position, take a pay cut and still work the same job."" I'm pretty sure that is illegal according to the Americans with Disabilities Act. They don't care! Human Resources never even bothered to return my 3 phone calls. In 5 years, i had 5 different department managers and 5 different store directors. Employee turn over was so rapid that it was hard to keep track of. Such a great store to shop in, but horrible to work for. My hard work was unappreciated and I was disposable. Like an old dirty tissue, they threw me away. I miss the wonderful customers and my co-workers, but you could not pay me enough money to go back there again."
bad,Job went from full time to part time. The job is ok but looking for more than what they are giving me. I put bulk food into the bulk bins.
bad,"Being employed at Sprouts was fun at first until,"
bad,"Management does not communicate well with employees"
bad,"The managers are sprouts are every unprofessional, and hypocritical, double standards for employees based on friendships outside of work. there are a few good apples within the store among the employees."
bad,"Nobody really knows what they are doing as far as upper management.  They try their hardest to not give raises and don't know much about their departments functions and how to do anything outside of desk work.  This place is just fun to work at, it doesn't pay well and the upper management is heartless.  I would suggest this job to a high schooler because they pay you like a high schooler no matter your experience.  they cut corners wherever they can, including not hiring where needed and not giving sufficent raises.  i know a 45 yr old that hasn't made 10 an hour even after 5 years.  pretty sad."
bad,"If I was bagging for the day, Id immediately check in with either the head cashier or a store manager and see what needed to be done in the front end. Retrieve shopping carts out in the blistering heat, Bag groceries, sweep the entire store every 30 minutes, Cant talk to other employees or you'll get yelled at, Clean the bathrooms every hour, take out the trash, restock bags up front if needed. Bulk section was a breeze, just fill the bins with what the bulk lead left for you to put out, keep the coffee area stocked and have fresh coffee for customers to drink, face entire area every three hours. "
bad,"A typical day at Sprouts tends to be more frusterating then successful. Work required versus hours is always at a serious inbalance. Sprouts is a growing company which brings alot of higher up tension that builds as it falls on the store employee. I did learn a lot from a few people in the stores I worked in. I cannot say that all management was sufficient and helpful. For the most part my efforts to complete daily tasks were ruined by micro management taking time to point out what I was already planning to do instead of throwing in a hand or asking what my plan was. The morale amongst associate level employees was non-existent due to this fact. The hardest part of the job was seeing a task, making a plan and having it changed constantly. The most enjoyable part of this whole experience was handing in my two weeks."
bad,"Inconsistent scheduling is the most annoying part of this job. Like the other reviewer wrote, you will work 6 days with only 1 day off sometimes. It's ridiculous. You'll feel like you never leave the place. There are enough employees that a rotating schedule would be a good option so everyone gets their days off, but apparently, management doesn't care enough to do that."
bad,Not what it use to be. To many changes and not much room for advancement. Seen way too many good employees let go because they weren't apart of the NETWORK.
bad,"Quick hire with simple process. No drug screening required. Great environment with welcoming employees, but very poor management. No true care for employees, only interested in filling shifts. Lack of respect, teamwork, & leadership. Great location with mostly kind customers. Opportunities to move up, based among performance."
bad,"Training and speaking of their Mission Statement and culture, non existent. Productivity and performance of employees very low on Sprouts  priorities."
bad,"They pay you the minimum that they can. There aren't many regulations or rules that prevent people from being lazy and calling in. When I worked there, my coworkers often took advantage of me by making me trade shifts with them or by covering their missed shifts. I was working full time hours but never got offered ANY benefits. No health, dental, no nothing."
bad,"Always asked to stay late but never allowed to OT. Managers play favorites. Hire buddies instead of internal hiring. Terrible payscale. Bad raise system. Work load keeps increasing for Head cashiers with no pay raise. If you transfer departments your ""yearly review raise"" gets re-set. Keep getting hours slashed."
bad,I work at the Marlton store and because of business being so bad we do not have hours and it’s very hard to live and be a successful person when you are barely getting paid. And the rate per hour isn’t horrible it’s the most I’ve ever been paid per hour (12.15) but the managers do not come together and talk behind each other  and will write you up for doing what is best for customer/doesn’t have steady policy
bad,"*Inconsistent scheduling "
bad,Be prepared to have no employees (2) and only have 120 hours a week for the whole department.  Monthly inventory-counting freezer.  Trainers are not trainers most do not know the departments.  They are there to check schematics and criticize
bad,They cut your hours if they don't like you. Managers cut you down and refuse to promote you after you literally GRIND for them. You could do so much and they won't even bother to see nor would they care. They don't follow up on pay raises. That's probably on the bottom of their bucket list. If you are trying to finish off the rest of your career and retire or currently going to college. But DON'T choose this as a career. The only totally awesome thing that was worth it is the crews. The crews make things so much easier. But that being said IF you get a good crew.
bad,"The company prides itself that it holds quality standards, that might be the case at corporate-level cause it’s not being held by those managing their stores. Leadership and communication skill training should be required for all new managment to attend, and be company provided, plus fully funded."
bad,"There is a manager that either ignores us completely, which is preferred. Or she is short tempered, negative, and sulky. She has a group of her favorites and if you don't fall into that group, you just hope to be ignored."
bad,"very stressful, little to no communication on my team, really fast pace. Co-workers were at least very friendly, food quality was good. Couldn't keep up due to mental health so I resigned within the next month of working. Good for people who like fast paced lifestyle but definitely not for everyone."
bad,"Sprouts has the potential to be a great place to work. Very nice people. Most moved on due to write ups about tiny human mistakes that would say final warning. We all got them.i was terrified."
bad,The way management is set up at sprouts encourages managers to cut corners with little to no regard for individual employees. It is common for long time quality employees to have their hours cut in half or even to a third with 0 warning. They like to hire people promising people without experience or little background qualification so they actually tend to do quite well with the employee selection but maybe its because of this they consider employees to be entirely disposable.
bad,"The people I work with a nice and polite but, I only scheduled to work 8 hours a week right now. Not enough to live on. So, I'm seeking other positions and training opportunities."
bad,It was a bit of a stressful job that not many people wanted to show up for. Management for the store wanted different things than management of the departments sometimes.
bad,"This is a terrible place to work. Hours are very inconsistent, managers have favorites, raises are horrible! Management honestly doesn't care or listen to concerns."
bad,The worst part of working there other than the incredibly disrespectful management was the fact that Sprouts touts itself as so healthy — it’s not — and the vast vast vast majority of management know ZERO about nutrition or homeopathy or herbal remedies or anything actually useful to the customer.
bad,I would rather not explain.  I have to move to another part of the valley. I enjoyed the other employee's that is really the only reason I stayed for so long.
bad,i did learn a few more new skills in the time i was there but also it had its bad moments and different changes through out the year i was there it was very overwhelming.
bad,"only 2 issues with the sprouts I had worked at 2 managers are terrible and incompetent and the hours are all over the place. toward the end of my time there I was only getting 2 days a week. they pawn that off as it is the slow time of year. in the meantime, they will crank out those manager bonuses. I would say it is moderately hard work with a fair amount of heavy lifting."
bad,Grand Junction store sets employees up to get them fired. I know of multiple employees who if the did not protect themselves would have been fired. The store manager consistently made fun of customer beliefs with her other store managers. They are not promoting a healthy work environment and just make the whole experience miserable. The corporate level do not know how to control their attitudes and it reflects on how the store managers treat their employees.
bad,"a lot of the employees where no call no show, somedays you work for hours alone, management doesn't seem to care about anything useless corporate was coming to visit seems like that's the only time they where will to give you extra help in your department"
bad,"Sprouts is fast growing company that could be great if there was ONE goal, One vision, and ONE set of directions on how to get there.  As a company it offers good benefits and decent wages."
bad,"Old boys club, its not how you do , but who you know, The lower management positions are all low stress , but with little advancement possibilities if you are not in the buddy pipeline"
bad,Good first job but most of he people that have been there for a while don't look very happy. You end up working whenever sprouts tells you and if you don't they act like you are wrong for doing so.
bad,"would not recommend. They would not move me to a permanent department and, the hours were extremely inconsistent. The staff was treated very poorly and, they worked on a competitive pay system the was extremely unfair."
bad,The compnay is still growing. Thus they are greedy about hours and money and dont give a care about employees. My recent manager cut hours severely just to ensure his  bonus.
bad,"Management is unhelpful, their communication skills are very poor. They expect you to stay past the end of your shift if that's what they want but then cut any overtime at the end of the week. Anything you can't complete on a day you are forced to cut short you are still disciplined on. You get no recognition for improving sales, decreasing shrink, or improving margin. You just get told there is always more you can do for the company. Since the new store manager has taken control, I have received nothing but criticism and any improvements made he has tried to take credit for."
bad,"Ultimately, I thought the job itself was fun and engaging. I left due to poor management, no training, and being sorely underpaid for a full time, overnight position. Further, during my time there, both supervisors were terminated without warning. I, then being the senior employee for my shift due to high turnover, was placed in the lead role with the obligation of training my new manager and without any offer of advancement or pay raise. "
bad,"Assistant store mangers and 1,2,3,managers are required to work Till"
bad,"Deli Clerk: They cut hours to save money but demand the same amount of work. You will get written up for things that are the manager's fault. "
bad,"Managers work excessively and have zero work life balance while receiving incredibly low wages. Bonuses are unattainable as corporate makes excuses for not paying out even when teams hit all goals. Top managers are paid okay but are controlled by out of touch corporate teams. Men are automatically paid higher rates with equal experience and sometimes lower work ethic. State labor laws are frequently violated with HR focused on hiding the violations rather than compliance and a better work environment. Building a great long term team is impossible with HR/corporate always blocking efforts to advance best employees or even give decent raises.  incompetent, outside people are always brought in for top positions and often without warning. The best are pushed out....most likely to keep wages and benefits down. Corporate greed. This is not the ethical company it once was."
bad,"Duties are customer service, checking out customers, also verifying drawer balances and closing out at the end of the night, setting up deposits.  Assisting other cashiers with price checks / returns.  Cleaning and restocking. If someone calls in finding a replacement."
bad,"no work advancement, inconsistent hours, horrible management out for their own, lied about change in department and didn't even call to let me know just gave me less hours, if your going to school don't work there not fair in wages"
bad,I have worked at sprouts for about a couple months now and I have noticed a lot of cliques and unfair treatment of employees. The first thing I noticed is that certain employees get more pay and hours then others. when I first started I was working only 2 days a week and now I only work one day a week. I also noticed that the other employees that I work with are at work pretty much almost everyday I even asked how many hours my other coworkers have. The other employees that I actually got along with ended up either eventually quitting or getting fired for something that's not even against store policy there is know way I wouldn't be able to pay the bills just from working at sprouts alone luckily the other job I have right now pays a lot more then the job I have at sprouts I give sprouts farmers market an extra star  because most of the jobs at sprouts are relatively easy.
bad,"over worked employees with bare minimum pay. expected to cover store managements duties without training, knowledge or authority. raises get promised and do not get paid. no genuine training, inconsistent schedules and overall poor attitudes of higher store managers. micro management of productive employees and non productive employees permitted and encouraged to continue thier routines."
bad,"This place isn't very good to be at, the treat employees very poorly and are unwilling to work with schedules. they only promote those who the managers like personally most people are less than qualified to be managers."
bad,"Sprouts is a company of failed promises, not recommend. under compensated, under staffed, and frustrating environment"
bad,"I worked at Sprout's Farmer's Market for 5 years, 2 of which I was a department manager, and I enjoyed very little of the experience overall. I was in college for the entirety of my time working here and found better employment elsewhere once I graduated. I can say that they are good at working around your schedule if you have other priorities in life, but that's usually only in circumstances in which you have good working relations with upper management, which I did."
bad,The business plan works for everyone except the employees. Lots of hype  with very little actual value in regards to  poromotion . Once your promoted your doing double time hours Leading teams of high school type real fresh and green kids. Good Luck with that!
bad,The customers were great!!! The management was not. I was a cashier i learned the different codes for produce. I wanted to change departments and learn everything i could about every department. But every time i asked to learn something new i was shot down. I would not work for this company again!!
bad,"WARNING: Seek employment here if it is a last resort, they hire anyone who walks through the door, and use only for temporary employment. Management is impossibly demanding, most of your co-workers aren't exactly the brightest."
bad,"I did not feel that management cared for their people, they always said that the subordinates need to support the managers, however the managers did not support the employees."
bad,I do not like this job for many reasons most of which are personal. I don’t feel respected or comfortable in this environment. I’m only working so I can pay for my bills.
bad,"I had gotten hired as a courtesy clerk two months before a friend of mine did (he's male and I'm not)- same position and amount of hours though he was often late or never showed, yet in two weeks of him working there, he was earning more than I was. Management was often cold and avoided talking- one head of management ""joked around"" with me by telling me to strangle myself. Being much younger when I had this job, I wasn't good at handling stress, but I think ANYONE would panic on one of the most busiest weekend days, going in and out to gather 8-12 carts at a time in 95+ degree weather. The friend I mentioned earlier hadn't shown up to help and no other employee would step up to help, even though customers had no carts and I had collapsed in the front of the store and was being consoled by customers only. Very toxic."
bad,The store manager has been somewhat hostile to associates and has been reported numerous times and the company has not taken any action towards this matter. I'm currently looking for something else.
bad,"This company's growth exceeds it's ability to  create uniform policies and lacks effective communication skills."
bad,"No problems, knew what had to get done,got it done. It was a fair company, took care of the ones that wanted to work. You could make up hours in other departments"
bad,"working at Sprouts I have to say the most of the employees were pretty good people. But the Management team were the worse example of management and leadership that I have ever seen. No support for their employees whatsoever. As far as the corporate office. They were even worse. were not very friendly to begin with, let alone knowledgeable about how to solve problems."
bad,Over all the company was decent to work for. Much more enjoyable before they took it public.  Presure to perform while trying to maintain low  pricing eventually lead to a change if Sr. Leadership.
bad,"managers will tell you to do stuff they would not be willing to do, keep you late to help with other departments. It didnt pay as much as they should have."
bad,"I enjoy my job, because I honestly enjoy working with people And with the public.  What I dont like about Sprouts is that they will cut your hours with no notice at all.  One week I will have 36 hours, and the next suddenly 12.  I know I am a great employee, which is why it's going to honestly be their loss when I resign soon.  But honestly, they wont care.  They will just find another body to fill my position, and keep their costs low."
bad,"Sprouts Farmer's Market is a frustrating place to work.  Many of the decisions made from upper management are extremely questionable.  These create problems for both the employees and customers."
bad,"the typical work day went as usual, around the morning time it is pretty slow, during this time most workers are just starting to come in preparing their workplaces for the day"
bad,"Stocking shelves is pretty easy, but the grocery manager doesn't prioritise things and make it difficult to get anything done. Also when a person who was more than qualified for assistant grocery manger applied, they were told that they were too young for the position and gave it to a unqualified person from another department."
bad,"The best part about working at Sprout's is the regular customers. I really enjoy the people that come in to shop and I like helping people find new things to try,  I also like the physical part of the job.  I am constantly on the move and stay very active throughout the day."
bad,"Cant keep help. Turn "
bad,Does not have a clear path to success. No career pathing. Leadership lacks strong communication skills to execute business goals. Lack of accountability.
bad,The deli department manager is very unprofessional. He does not know how to speak to people.  Sprouts does not care who they promote. They promote children that lack basic manners and communication skills. They lack on training employees and management.  They need to teach management how to communicate with their employees. In stead of belittling them. They say you work as a team. But you are constantly left alone in the department. And if something doesn’t get done you are to blame. They are constantly contradicting themselves. You are constantly doing managements job. While they are hiding out in the computer room. Or taking over an hour to write an order. They tell you to do something a certain way and they don’t follow it. It’s also frowned upon to take your breaks. Making sure the department is taken care of is more important than taking a break that you are entitled to.
bad,The store is run as though the Manager wasn’t popular in high school and wants to make others pay for that said unpopularity.  No real chance of advancement with the current manager.  Shameful that a company can be run this way.
bad,I did not like sprouts at all poor management  rushed to complete task that required strength attention  perfection. The job wore you down in tyme .this job should of not rushed order selectors as much when lifting thousands  of pounds within a 13 hour shift sometimes more should b paced a little slower but buy them rushing us the owners and managers  did not care about its workerd
bad,"Fast paced, little training, out of touch upper management, lots of work to do, pay doesnt feel like its enough for the work."
bad,"I rarely get enough scheduled hours and the store/department managers are good people who don't know how to manage employees. This causes lots of tension between employees and managers, which affects employee morale, which affects the turnover rate, which affects customer service."
bad,"No overtime, 10.63 an hour.  Scheduled for 3 to 5 hours a day.  No consistent time of day to be scheduled.  Poor training and head cashier will embarrass you if you make a mistake. Not an easy job by any means."
bad,"Typical day was high stress due to understaffing, some expectations were unrealistic."
bad,Worked there for a little more than a year. Startup environment with small grassroots teams that often struggled to work together to develop synergy. There was a new but ineffective data infrastructure that we often found challenging to query or develop effective solutions from. There seems to be a push to change the workplace culture but at the time of my departure it still was outdated in terms of their hiring practices (low ratio of women and minorities in higher level management positions).
bad,"Most of the people working there are cool, but hours and store management is inconsistent and sucky. One of the managers chose to ignore a person who made the customers uncomfortable and was stocking me even when confronted by customers and myself."
bad,Lack of hours and poor management plus terrible communication with employees from managers. They cut hours and still want you to get the work done like you were working a eight hour shift
bad,"I came from a previous job at Trader Joe's and the two companies are worlds apart in their operations. Trader Joe's trains thoroughly and runs a tight ship. This gives employees confidence in themselves as well as the company. Sprouts couldn't be any more opposite. It's highly disorganized and the employees suffer for it. Trader Joe's cares about customer service whereas Sprouts only looks at their bottom line, first and foremost. You only need to observe the disposition/demeanor of the cashiers at Sprouts vs. Trader Joe's to see which company cares about customer service."
bad,"A typical day at work was just like any other cashiering experience. I learned a lot of customer service and grocery. Store manager is nice. The front end manager is also the scheduling manager and is ok. Bakery manager doesn't care about availability and will schedule you when you're not available. Hardest park of the job on front end is staying busy when it's slow. The most enjoyable is bakery because you're always busy and the day goes by fast. I love the bakery! Lastly, about scheduling...the work week starts on Monday but the schedule for the week doesn't come out till 3 days before on Friday so if you require planning as with child(ren), it's going to be extremely difficult. The schedule is NEVER the same. One good thing is we have an online scheduler that allows you to put your availability or request time off for appointments etc as well as swap shifts. My experience in San Diego was far better than my experience in AZ. In San Diego I got nearly 40 hours a week, here I barley get 20.    My experience in San Diego was way better than my experience in AZ. I was a Sprouts FAN!! Now I dread coming to work. Management was amazing in San Diego...so it is different from place to place."
bad,Being a manager means many late and over night nights. Lots and lots of heavy lifting and lots of physical work. Orders and tags is the majority of what you do.
bad,"Learned a lot. Had a lot of good store managers that taught me a lot. But the ones that I have had that are not good tend to not get any training to correct them or corrective action performed by regional or higher. Learned a lot about buisness and knowledge i can use for new opportunities and my future. The hardest part is not getting help and feeling overwhelmed. The best is when me and my teams hard work pays off and we get high sales and comps, not to mention winning contests and getting a little extra moolah."
bad,"I work at an insanely busy store. My department has been perpetually short of help. "
bad,I am interested In leaving this place because hours for employees is very inconsistent and the management has not been all that good for the year I have been there.
bad,"I work as a cashier at a newly opened Sprouts. I really like my co-workers and head cashiers. I've had very little interaction with the asst mgr or the store mgr so I can't say much about them, although neither of them seem very friendly. "
bad,"Store manager would interfere with stocking orders and expect nothing but perfection. Made several mistakes, as in ordering one and a half week's worth of merchandise that ended up taking space in the back rooms of other departments. Store manager never took responsibility and I hear now he got a promotion. Coworkers bonded over the situation as the store was better off when he was gone. Pros: You never felt like the only one in that situation. Some managers helped the store during rush hours, but others just sat back."
bad,Corporate folks are treated the same as the part time store folks.  There is no remote working. There is no tuition reimbursement.  There are very few paid holidays.  The 401 K plan is minimal.  No fitness reimbursement.  The company needs to be more progressive in its culture if it wants to retain educated employees.
bad,Sprouts is so behind the times. They work you like a dog and pay you nothing. I went through 7 grocery managers in a years time. Yet I was never offered the position with my 25 years experience. They say one thing and another
bad,"i wouldn't recommend this to anyone who wants to stay here long. retention rate of employees was shakey at best, no one tolerated the environment long and didnt give thier loyalty to this job. management was rude and even makes comments when they see me in town about ""what they believe"" about me, gossip and cruel behaviors are very common here."
bad,"The hardest part of the job is that upper / middle company management, work priorities, and scheduling are all over the place. Gotcha workplace culture run buy an out of touch CEO."
bad,Smh but I love what Sprouts represents. The people that carrying out the duty of keeping it great if they love it they should let it go. It's nasty they hired people that don't care about people or clean food. They sweep things under the rug like what really happens to the food or how rude they really are to people. They falsify documents. I wouldn't eat out the deli unless I see God bless it.  If you speak up about things being nasty flies mating on the food and crawling everywhere you become a problem. Everyone one is lazy except the the 4 Core and a few select that get overlooked. Sad sad sad place.
bad,"Sprouts has does well to carve out its place in the competitive grocery retail environment.  Unfortunately, as this competition grows, the stress on the upper leaders in the company appears to be bringing out the worst in them."
bad,not a good job. often over worked due to lack of employees and was highly stressful. would not recommend job to anyone. not worth the comp. and no room for advancement
bad,The hardest part of my job is dealing with the management. I enjoy working and talking to customers. I learn from what we do right to not make the same mistake.
bad,"There is very poor management, people are coming in and out like a revolving door and they do not pay people a fair wage for their previous work experience."
bad,"sprouts farmers market by far is the worst place I've ever worked at. they dontcare about the employees, overall never will i ever go back to work for that company"
bad,"Working at Sprouts as a new hire you feel inspired and ready to achieve the next steps in your career with Sprouts. Recently things changed and management/corporate changed things for the worse, resulting in no hours to give to department employees, which also results in work that cannot be accomplished in the time allocated."
bad,"First, let me give a brief overview of the positives, as Sprouts doesn't deserve praise for them. Most non-management workers and some management are nice and the health culture encouraged me to get fit. "
bad,lack of communication and career advancement. managers do not take consideration and listen to their employees. i met great people however and i did learn another department but for my benefit.
bad,"Don't expect an 8-5, corporate works long and hard.  Great employees, decent benefits, almost makes up for the too small teams but not the nights and weekends."
bad,"The people I work with are exceptional, however, the store manager is less than desirable.  Being the bakery manager taught me a lot. I enjoyed learning about retail grocery stores. The hardest part of the job is trying to get everything done within the 40 hr a week time frame.  My department was always understaffed & I never received any help from upper management, but was always reprimanded for not finishing tasks."
bad,"I learned more about food quality and specifications than I thought possible. Based on positions available and allocation of hours, this job is best suited for individuals seeking temporary employment, more as a stepping stone than a career."
bad,"Quickly going down the tubes in terms of morale, support and overall job satisfaction. So many managers jumping ship to go elsewhere, taking less money just to be happy."
bad,"When I first started out, I had aspirations of moving up within the company...but lately I've been disillusioned. The main issue, that I've also heard from others, has been management: they give you leniency and then out of nowhere they suddenly change with no particular reason why. There's little to no consistency, or communication."
bad,"Hardest workers are not given raises because they are loyal and will keep doing the job regardless. Serious discrimination of female employees, and male management that is often very out of line. Unexplained difference between pay for male and female workers, even if the female has more experience, does a better job, and is a higher rank.  Little to no time off...two days a week rare, two in a row even more rare. Male management uses sick time for any reason. I’ve used one sick day total and it was for my child, in the past 6months...this resulted in a viscous verbal beating about my “childcare” issues. No one can speak up about anything because of fear of losing a needed job and top management knows this. There will never be a time in this company where the best aren’t taken advantage of to the point of being forced out. Always extremely understaffed so at least you have job security...if you want it. Tons of good food thrown out when many regular employees can not afford food because of hours being dramatically cut. In over 20 years of working different areas and different retail, this has been far and above the worst company I’ve ever worked for, very sad but very true. CEO rumored to be a very nice great guy but unaware of a vicious company culture."
bad,"Its been almost year since I've been working for sprouts. It was a good job in the beginning. It was a good atmosphere and I enjoyed the job. But the management changed and it is not good as it used to be. They expect too much and overwork you. They fail to recognize your hard work and it feels like they don't appreciate me as an employee. I asked many times if i could get promoted, but the managers ignore me and make up some excuse. My typical job duties are getting carts, doing hourly sweeps, doing go backs, and checking bathrooms. but they make me do more things that other departments of the store should be responsible for. The most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers. They make my shift more bearable and make it pass by fast."
bad,"Sprouts is a cool place to shop, but not work. You are always moving and work in places where they are lacking employees. Getting carts is terrible because you have to go around an entire plaza at 11PM. If you are good with a busy day everyday and stress to do things fast, then this is the company to work for."
bad,"Always busy completing tasks throughout the day , and offering exceptional customer service. Collaborate with team members to provide excellent service to customers throughout their entire shopping and purchasing experience. Perform all aspects of shipping and receiving."
bad,"Managment does not care about the employees, employees are treated okay. corprate is a tightnit unit unless you are friends with them you get no where"
bad,At Sprouts we get to learn about different types of fruits and vegetables. Working here great. I like the pace of work. Its nice hustle in the retail business.
bad,"Extreme on micro management, inconsistent with hours, too few hours in a work week, and found the upper management to be bitter. Work environment I found to be depressing.  Time flew by because of the work pace.  Customers were most enjoyable."
bad,Laid off and worked over 40 hours every week. Came in when I was asked and stayed late. Worked harder than other workers there and got laid off out of nowhere
bad,If you are a teenager looking for a part time job then it's a great place to work. But if you need more hours then it's best to be looking somewhere else.
bad,When I worked there people would leave left and right. The management is a complete joke. You would ask for help and get help like a hour later. They will promise you certain things when you are hired and then not deliver on them. You are better off working for a different store.
bad,I would not recommend employment at Sprouts Farmers Market to many people. It is a fast-paced job with many physical requirements and very little possibility for advancement if you aren't personally involved with upper management.
bad,I wouldn't ever work here again. The management at the store and corporate level is horrible. The pay is ok but it's not a full time job and really hard to get advancements.
bad,"The store as a whole is fun and employees are great. The management is hard to work with and the Front End (cashiers/courtesy clerks) have the worst job in the store. Management is hardest on the front end, making the turn over rate high."
bad,"My experience at Sprouts Farmers Market was stressful because that particular store would not hire enough people to efficiently run the busy departments. There were 5 people in the grocery department and we were forced to cover Grocery, Frozen, and half of the Dairy Department for less than $10 per hour. The managers would attempt to rush us around in the middle of working and customer assistance just to get more work for the departments they didn't hire anyone for. I was told upon beginning work that customer service was of the highest importance and that it was what separated sprouts from other stores, yet i was told i spent too much time helping customers. The customers loved the help i gave them cause it came from genuine concern and knowledge. Sprouts attempts to present the image that they care about affordable health, but after working there it is clear that profit is the number one motivator. I do not mean to give the entire company a poor report though it could deserve it, my experience started okay and gradually got worse with every passing day. The hours were very inconsistent especially around holidays, I understands business begins to wain but peoples' rent and bills do not."
bad,"Great place to work when wanting to try new products, the customers are their main focus, want the customers to have a great experience during their visit."
bad,"Overworked"
bad,"Great people, not so great place. baggers probably did most of the work for running the stores daily operations. very labor intensive but its a good first job."
bad,"While the grocery store has exceptional products at reasonable prices, and the fellow co-workers are polite and easy to get along with, Sprouts fails to properly take care of their employees. The management pays little regards to employees availability and will schedule them against it, and when you bring it to their attention, they will cut your hours down to unreasonable standards until you are ultimately forced to find a second job or a new one altogether. It may be desirable for a student's part time job, for anyone else it is too inconsistent and unfair."
bad,a typical workday consists of a busy store and an understaffed front end. Management tries very hard to save labor even if it means not enough cashiers working. The hardest part of the job is being understaffed and the most enjoyable is the friendly employees.
bad,"I manage the deli department. I'm required to make sure all deadlines are met, production has been done, as well service needs met."
bad,"The store looks like it's going out of business. Management doesn't seem to care about how it looks. Employees are cool, they work hard, but the button blue shirts can care less about them. There's nothing competitive about their pay neither.  The pay sucks for what you put up with."
bad,"I meet interesting people everyday once i clock in and also made some cool friends as well. "
bad,"a typical day usually requires the work space to be in complete and utter disarray. constant micro managing slowing down actual workforce, and then having to take the blame for why the department didn't comp for that day."
bad,"Outstanding work ethic fun , great customer service on time Conducted and /or reviewed analytical studies and surveys; formulated procedures policies and program alternatives made recommendations on a broad spectrum of administrative and program-related problems; reviewed and analyzed proposed legislation and advised management on the impact or potential impact ; acted as team leader."
bad,"Sprouts hires people expecting them to do the work of two people. Rather than hiring enough people and giving kickbacks to those who do the work of two people. People are not given merit raises, but only an annual raise. If you have years of prior experience there is no guarantee that they will pay you what you were worth. They pay a bit more than minimum wage, but it is not quite a livable wage. They start everyone at part time, and that is part time part time. You'll be lucky if you get 17 hours a week. Sprouts had a history of taking care of their employees, but this changed relatively recently. Do not join this company."
bad,"When first starting there the hours are great, but once you have been there for more than a few weeks management cuts hours to very few.  Very unorganized and overall not a company you'd want to work for."
bad,"Within the department i worked in, i was constantly hounded for my work never being enough. There are a total of three sections i had to watch over. When you only have a five hour shift to clean reorganize and fill empty holes, you can only do so much work. If i finished one section i was ridiculed for the other two."
bad,"Management was playing to favorites often, hard to move up in the company if you are not a favorite, employees drive up to the parking lot and dislike being there"
bad,"Whether you're a hard worker or not. There is no room for advancement at this specific store. I'm not saying this about the company, but specifically for this store."
bad,A great work environment with friendly staff. Free lunch and management is always willing to listen.
bad,"Sprouts on 92nd and Shea seemed a great place to work. Management doesn't care; they operate with blinders on. There is an open door policy, but...They don't listen nor do they care. The only plus is the 15% discount. A typical day at work is being micro managed, ignored, harassed in front of customers, retaliated against... My co-workers also complain about poor management! They do not condition you to be promoted instead they ignore you. Management is nowhere to be found, nowhere on the floor. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management. You could be deathly ill and they will not let you go home. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers. New cashier hires may last a week to a few months, max. I currently work here but not for much longer. I've had enough of poor management."
bad,"Going into this job, the environment, employees, and management was significantly better than the previous grocery store I worked at. The only hit I took when I started at Sprouts was a slight pay cut, but at the end of the day it was worth it to be around a pleasant staff and friendly shoppers."
bad,"Over the last 3 years this company has gone from the penthouse of employers tot he outhouse of employers. I have worked here for over 4 years. When I first started here it was an enjoyable working environment, but then once they went from a small family owned company to a corporatized company it turned into a cutting corners company. Away went the six-evals and the yearly evals arrived. The management team is so childish. Too much favoritism. I was told on my most recent evaluation that I wasn't getting a raise, so I technically have to go 2 years before I'm up to get a raise. Anytime there's a job opening you won't know about it since they already who's gonna get it. They reward brown nosers, employees that kiss up to management and lazy workers not the individuals whom work their tails off. If you're not well liked be prepared for unpleasant working environment. I could go on & on about how terrible this company is to work for. I almost forgot about that during the slow season you will get your hours cut drastically."
bad,lax management of workers
bad,"The people you work with save this job. They are friendly and welcoming. It makes it harder to know that many of them get taken advantage of when working for this company. They do however offer benefits and a store discount."
bad,"Sprouts is a decent job for anyone looking for a place to pay the bills while they look for a more suitable job.  The hours were fine, work was basic grocery store tasks, and the coworkers were fun to interact and befriend.  Biggest con was the management and upper management.  Refusal to raise pay more than a couple of cents, hard work going unnoticed, and constant under staffing meant closing and opening alone the majority of the time."
bad,"This job started fantastically, but once there a few months they cut hours and still expect you to do what you can in 40 hours in 32, upper management only cares about themselves, they state in the beginning it’s a family atmosphere but that couldn’t be farther from the truth"
bad,"Poorly managed-multiple cases of borderline illegal practices towards treatment of employees. Promoted a new manager who is clueless and risks future lawsuits from lack of education and power tripping. High turnover rate. Unhappy workers and complaining. Endless training videos. Hard cement floors cause foot problems. You will walk 5 miles a day working here going back and forth. Nature of the work is repetitive, hard on the body (from having to bend and squat), and dull. Corporate so be prepared for endless paperwork and procedures to get anything done."
bad,Opportunities for advancement abound but don't expect to ever make a living wage. Promotions are ten percent of your current pay. Annual raises are based on reviews and can range from one percent to three percent. State minimum wage is raising faster than pay rates. My personal experience has been one of working hard but being stuck in perpetual poverty.
bad,"Managers have favorites who get the best shifts and any chances at advancement.  The managers can be childish and vindictive.  As an example, I have seen employees call in managers to back them up in disputes between employees and the manager backed the person clearly in the wrong who called them just because she was favored."
bad,"I was not allowed to change anything to attempt to make the work go smooth or faster. After a time we werent even able to look at our inventory list. Despite me being a senior clerk, I had no access to the ordering system. And i was only promoted because the regional manager intervened and overrode our managers decision. they repeatedly hired new people, and understaffed. Such small staff was unable to complete jobs given since most were new employees, 60% yearly turnover rate at our particular store"
bad,"A typical day for an assistant grocery manager consists of placing orders, stocking shelves, deligating tasks, and keeping track of other department employees.There are a lot of moving parts to this position and a lot is expected of you. There are never enough hours in a day to complete everything on your list, so you have to be able to prioritize."
bad,Lack of Communication form management to staff. A lot of turnover. Often pulled from your dept to assist in another.  Not a lot of team work. Out of stock on many items advertised.
bad,Management likes to play favorites so if you are not one of the favorites you don’t advance in the company. Nepotism is also an issue as workers will be treated favorably and move up faster in the company if they have family in the corporate office. Coworkers are great and make working there bearable
bad,"My time at sprouts was a whirlwind of chaos and unknowingness. I was hired on the spot and was trained little to none. My equals knew more about the job and what it entailed and were 100% nicer about showing me the ropes than management was. Management is lazy with a capital Z. If you are a student, they might take your schedule into consideration but they might not. Solving and fixing a problem took ages and we’re passive aggressively shown how to fix. If you are looking for a job that will require you to start taking anxiety medicine look no further!"
bad,"Store management is bad. I relocated here from another Sprouts on a lie and ended up having to take a $5 pay cut because of it. The turnover is high here for a reason and it’s because they don’t value the employees. My particular store is the #1 store in the company, yet they cut hours. Doesn’t make any sense! They also give you no incentive to be great at your job because they don’t make you feel valued. With how they treat the employees, no wonder so many people leave and you’re constantly understaffed."
bad,Job offered and pay promised was never rewarded due to politics and location closed for poor sales and location. When inquiring about opportunity to earn additional by traveling was promised but never allowed to when asked was told dept needed me
bad,Often understaffed new employees where not trained right. They would want you to do something fast rather than right. New hires would often be left alone because or call ins. Most managers would not help out. It was a good company 12 years ago when the went public it changed.
bad,"If you like being thrown into the mix without any training or support, maybe this is the place for you. It was really easy to get a job there because of the constant turnover. You have to stay late, go in on your days off, and training is next to nothing. Initially, I was sat in front of a computer for two hours, watched some modules, and then on my  first day I wasn't trained on anything. I was basically the deli's honey-doer. I had to ask for a task because I didn't know what I was doing. I had a book that showed pictures of how the food was to be prepared, but other than that I had to ask a million questions while everyone was scurrying around me to get other things done. I felt left alone and left to sink or swim. I kept being told I was going to watch more modules online, or that I was going to be trained on specific areas in the deli, but I never was."
bad,Poor lack of communication.and lack of training. No pay increase.and always short of products to due ur job. I won't adivce anyone working at this location in madison Al
bad,"Courtesy Clerk position is the lowest and you are treated like it. You help every other position but no help is ever returned. All the dirty work a lot of physical labor. A typical day in the life is a 8 hour shift where each hour you must sweep the entire store, clean the bathrooms, take all the trash out, and fetch all the carts in the parking lot manually no machine to help. Only receive minimum wage and 10 percent off, when other positions make more and get 15 or 20 percent off."
bad,"not what i hoped it would be. Not dissimilar from my last same industry job,but  a lot of miscommunicated information that made for an uncomfortable working environment."
bad,"The work place was laid back but very immature in nature all around.  It was unprofessional from management and down, problems were not dealt with in the proper manner.  It is okay for a part-time job while in school but not for a long term career."
bad,"Worked here for two months. Started out with a little over 20 hours a week but after awhile they'll reduce your hours. Most of my coworkers and I were getting usually 10-15 a week. High turnover rate. Don't count on being able to support yourself with a part time job here unless you have another job on the side. "
bad,"Management  is horrid throughout this company, while staff suffers from constant hour cuts and new hires during hour shortages. "
bad,"I worked 9 months, within the first month I was offered a cashier position and accepted but suddenly they hired more cashiers and had ""no use"" anymore for being one even though the place constantly is over the speakers calling for cashier help. Then a couple months after the same thing happened only there was a position to move over to bakery and the day I ask the Head Store Manager, they already hired 2 more people for Bakery. Until about 6 months into the job was working for the front end till I finally got out to bulk. Which was nice and was a good change for me, however they then kept saying they would promote me to bulk, but instead promoted someone who did the same amount amount of work as me, but is the store favorite. This store is all about favorites and only pays attention to them, so if you aren't a favorite, plan on quitting cause they will also just give you less and less hours till you force yourself to quit.Also, unless you have a really good customer service persona, I suggest not applying here cause you can get really weird people that come through the store."
bad,"At Sprouts I started as a full time employee in the dairy department. It was a great job and everyone like working there. Then we got a new store manager who sets unrealistic expectations, will cut peoples hours or completely take them off the schedule if he doesn't think you are working hard enough even though you are giving it your best. Which is what happened to me and now I am going from working 40 hours a week to just working 1 day, even though he knows I just moved out on my own and need the hours. I do take it personal but it could all come down to the change that recently just happened up in corporate. Its not the worst place to work for but there is a reason it was listed as the 6th worst company to work for in America."
bad,"The one thing i took away from Sprouts was all of the amazing employees i was able to work with. My Sprouts team was in a way my second family. There was a BUNCH of drama though, exactly like highschool which was annoying. Some managers cared about employees, but then other had no idea what they were doing. "
bad,"Find somewhere else to work it's not a company that really cares about there associates."
bad,"I worked at Sprouts for roughly about 2 years. Over that particular time span; I have seen a multitude of managers come and go. The company favors those who do not put in the work, and they seem to acquire some of the most incompetent managers I ever met. My day would typically start with breaking down an unfinished truck from maybe a few days back, and grocery managers wouldn't even offer to assist you a majority of the time. I closed every night by myself for about 4 months without any help at all. We were constantly understaffed, and people were quitting left and right. Co-workers were a blast to work with, and many of them came from different walks of life. Another downside to this was dealing with rude, insolent, and ignorant customers who were very snobby, and self-absorbed. They constantly complained about the littlest stuff, and some were bold enough to walk in our office during meetings. This is a great job starting off as a teenager, but not for adults who are looking to progress towards becoming a manager."
bad,Pay is good although I was promised more perks than what were actually available at  time of hire. Management was terrible did not care about their people just numbers.
bad,"There are two departments you wanna stay away from.. Simply cause of the people who work in, you'll get screwed over multiple times and there's a high level of stress too. Those two departments are Deli and Meat departments. Plus these two departments have HIGH turn overs. Seriously people have and do walk away. So if you get hired in there.. good luck! Btw both morning groups are full of jerks."
bad,"70+ hour work weeks, unreasonable deadlines and expectations, lack of appreciation, poor management, chaotic and unorganized work environment, lack of communication from leadership"
bad,"When I first started working at sprouts I had a really rewarding experience. They factored in my previous experience and gave me a good starting salary and offered me good career advancement. But all good things come to an end. Corporate moves management constantly good managers go and leave while the bad managers stay. The last couple of years working at sprouts has drastically change due to the nature of the industry. Corporate is always making changes some good some useless but it puts stress on the management and stresses them out which in turn will stress out the employees. After all the years I put into the company I didn't feel respected enough, ( I got 100% on my safety audit but didn't get recognized like the others who got 100%) morale was low, and management always seemed to favorite the workers who did less work. One thing I noticed the most was favoritism. where its okay for one employee to take short cuts (or even management) but its not okay for others. Sprouts is good if you are finishing up high school or college but don't plan on making this a career choice, its pretty degrading. What made this job the worst was the employee data breach of 2015 where someone from corporate mistakenly gave out employees information to identity thieves, and Sprouts didn't take care of the employees that got affected well enough. in fact they treat those ones the worse."
bad,"I loved my job before we were a publicly traded company.  We have lost the ""family"" feel.  I read an old mission statement and it is more further from the truth than anything I have read."
bad,"Coworkers are great but corporate does not support or care about employees and is not competitve with compensation, benefits,  or advancement. it is the last stop for those who have nowhere else to go and the company treats its employees as such."
bad,"Sprouts was pretty terrible, the management is poorly run, the store is old and full of problems. The pay is bad, especially considering the amount of work you are expected to do."
bad,"I really don't have anything thing to write, I just need a place to grow a career and I thought it was with sprouts but , I'm starting to second guess myself, due to the changes I'm seeing with in the company"
bad,"Corporate yahoos that have no idea of what each store sells send you a never ending flow of forced merchandise.  They tell you to fill out a prebook survey for merchandise and if you don't put enough merchandise on the survey they will up your numbers and overload your backroom, and heaven help you if you have the gall to actually put a zero down for something on a prebook they will call your store manager and start threatening people.  No one is happy, its kinda funny actually we have a huddle meeting and everyone is cheering and clapping then when they go back to work everyone is talking about hating their job.  KEHE is the supplier for most of the grocery items coming in and they are terrible.  I think they must own a part of our company because KEHE tells us what is going to happen and we just have to go along with it.  They send out of date merchandise that we dont even order and then we have loads of mispicks for thing we do order and they just slap a tag on whatever they want and send it to you.  Its no wonder most of the grocery departments are overflowing in the backroom."
bad,"Work, fellow team members, customers are enjoyable. Demands, unrealistic expectations are stressful. We are expected to have store in perfect condition which is impossible while it is being shopped."
bad,My work day there is very good for the most part but that is only when I see the customers. Most of my co-workers aren't so friendly and very rude. Management is horrible.
bad,"They don't have an organized well planned out hiring/training/new store process. You will go to several different stores to train, fill out forms, and have orientation. If you don't have the funds for gas or to deal with vehicle issues (like a flat tire) this is not the place for you. They are, however, a new kind of store for our area and seem like a really casual and fun place to work once you get going but the problem is getting to the going part, lol. My suggestion is to wait til they are open to apply. Don't apply at new stores unless you are prepared to drive all over. Hopefully, if you apply at a store that is already open you will get to do paperwork, orientation, and training at that store."
bad,Management ran our department like an Army drill sgt. Never anything good or complimentary to say. Always fault-finding...I understand that the environment is not typical Sprout's policy - it was certainly not the same environment I worked in at the previous store.
bad,"My job is to make sure all cashiers get breaks on time,   have enough cash in tills and take out when they have too much cash,   I approve returns and exchanges.   If I have a closing schedule I make sure tills balance at the end of each shift"
bad,5+ years in Store Support. New management every year made it difficult to connect and embrace the newest company culture. Constant system changes made workload difficult.
bad,Like i said before i hate being insulted by managers when i work for them and they have plenty. If you close 5 minutes late they get mad at you insult you in front of guests. If you dont want to be treated like a human being work here.
bad,"The company cares more about the bottom line than it does employee welfare. Appalling wages, no guaranteed hours. Managers are stressed to cut hours while maintaining a high level of customer service. An impossible task in busier stores."
bad,"I obtained a vast knowledge of the meat, poultry, and seafood industries and had a lot of great co-workers. The management went way too far with their micromanaging."
bad,"I had high hopes about Sprouts when I was hired. I was sold on the great workplace culture, potential for advancement, teamwork, and products. After a while the place lost its luster. I was hired for a part time position and was told they would work with my full time school schedule, but instead they schedule me 37 hours a week and I feel guilty for having to request time off for school. I feel that Sprouts takes advantage of their employees to the fullest extent possible, with as much as they can get away with. Im usually given so much work in my department that I never have time to take my second 15 minute break that employees are given. Ive asked management for help and I was told (yelled at) No, I had to do it myself (as they sat in the office telling me this). I feel that management doesn't support the store team and really only cares about attendance and if you leave on time. There isnt really any structure or supervision, which is great and inspires independence, but I also feel that I could leave the store if I wanted to and come back and no one would notice. The chances for advancement seem more like employees thrown into management positions and has a ""sink or swim"" kind of vibe to it. The company keeps changing or discontinuing products at an alarming rate without any notice or regard. It's just on the shelf one day and gone the next and we're never told, so it's always a guessing game on what to tell disappointed customers."
bad,stock up product and help customers find products. management started good but lately it seems they have favoritism. the people i work with are great and reliable to finish task. the hardest part is breaking down a load and most enjoyable is talking to customers.
bad,From day one co workers walk around moping and pouting. Managers lose and forget important documents such as me appiclation and jury duty papers. I felt like i was back in high school and not in a good way. Co workers gossip and put others down usually didn't find out that I was messing up or going to slow until I got written up for it.
bad,"They pay very low, the insurance is not good, they ask customers for donations all the time, they hold people accountable arbitrarily, the training is horrible, and the music makes people angry"
bad,A very nice place to work. Staff is excellent to work  with . Will be a start for anyone trying to get ahead . The door is always open give them chance.
bad,"Never know what you're going to get,  there's favoritism, if your not management your not appreciated. No communication. Lack of training.  Management really doesn't care that you left another job to come to support a new store.  All the hype isn't there."
bad,The management needs to stop being lazy. And do their jobs. And to listen more no wonder no one really like working there.. and the managers need to stop picking on the courtesy clerk and making them cry
bad,"At this particular location, revolving door to hiring. Management lacked leadership skills. Unfortunately this store is giving Sprouts name the brand that they do not promote nor stand behind when it comes to employees, the training, and open door policy!"
bad,"Training was a mess lack of materials for training as well as lack of accommodations with employees specifically with Uniforms had 1 shirt for a month and a half, treats someone who has a title as a regular employee. upper management doesn't cooperate well with department managers. department manager micromanages people. expects you to perfect your departments appearance while you are by yourself and at the same time you have to deal with customers needs. they complain too much and not a single appreciation ever heard, they belittle you, my department manager pretends he's doing something in the office through all his shift. lack of teamwork coming from department manager."
bad,"Managers be little employees. If you call in for a legitimate excuse, they retaliate against you by cutting hours. You have to be on call 24/7.  Mangers do not care about employees."
bad,"I started at sprouts at the age of 16. It was my first job and I had no idea what it was going to be like until I actually started. Fast forward two and a half years, most of the other people in my position had been promoted into higher positions (something I was promised when I was hired), I made minimum wage up until a month before I quit when I was given a small raise, and everyone else in my position was put on high pedestal when I was treated as though I had always done something wrong. Overall, would not recommend long term."
bad,good coworkers but bad management. The management didnt know how to manage at all and made the employees so everything and give them no credit at all.
bad,Sprouts was a good company to work for. My store has some issues with direct management and store management that made it hard for a lot of good poeple to stay
bad,Sprouts is a very stressful place to work not only do you get pressure from managers but you also get stress from the customers. If something goes wrong back and forth on whos fault it is
bad,i have not been happy for a long time! im ready to move on to something else and i just really feel like they dont care about there employees either. sorry.
bad,"I worked with a new store for a little over a year. I had advanced to an assistant Manager in the Deli out of pure luck. If you are a hard worker and want a management position, they won’t plain it out until there is an empty body. Your day to day tasks are a serious overload, oh and full-time is considered 32 hours/week so if hours need to be cut, best believe you will be working 7.5 hour days. Deli is a lot of drama as the 4 core tries to mellow it out but they also become apart of it. It’s a bit like high school, if you are a popular person you will get promoted. But if you work to the best of your abilities and don’t socialize then there will be excuses to not promote you. All around, I met some pretty amazing people that don’t deserve all the BS of shift gaps, poor labor and lack of help. Oh and they are pretty good with convincing new employees how great the company is but until you carry responsibilities that continue to pile up, you learn how much corporate really doesn’t care.  Great for part time employees all though if you are someone that usually doesn’t pass background checks then it’s great for a last resort. I have never seen so many employees quit or walk out before. Also when you are in management, you are not allowed two days off in row and must work weekends unless you can sly past management with a good schedule but it’s rare. Also, they take advantage of your hourly pay. My new deli manager only made $1.50 more than I, wich should be a  $22/ hour job for sure. Overall, I boycott shopping at Sprouts because of how unorganized it is and how their employees"
bad,"Adequate job as a part-time job, if you can afford to work 15 hours a week or fewer.  Management is under pressure to cut labor while keeping up customer service standards, which in my store is impossible.  They never schedule enough people on the front end and customers always complain about long lines and hurried service.  I am hardly ever scheduled more than 15 hours a week, like most of the front end crew."
bad,"I went into this job hoping that I would get a good paying job. I ended up working maybe 3 days a week, and only five hours a day even though I had applied for full time. I didn't really know who exactly was my main manager so when I quit I didn't really know who to give it to. The people were nice though. They complimented me on my work. But it just didn't seem organized."
bad,"While I worked at SFM the management was horrible. They played favorites, were inconsistent with their decision making and I soon found out after I left that managers were pocketing money from the registers. If the management changes then Sprouts would be an ideal high school job."
bad,"Sprouts was a decent work place to be involved with. I don’t recommend this place to friends due to the kind of treatment I’ve experienced, along with friends I’ve met there have experienced."
bad,I learned a lot about all kinds of food and nutrition and how to be a great manager and all the skills that a manager need to know like ordering making schedules great inventory and great organizing skills
bad,"Only gives part time hours, so it's good for someone who is retired and needs extra work, or someone who is in college. Bakery tasks are numerous and they expect it to be done in far too short time."
bad,"A poor working environment, lack of direction with high expectations, poor communication regarding duties, no apreciation from department managers, little recognition from store manager, despite the hard work and achievements of crew members. Poor recognition of talents during reviews. No follow up. No team work exibited. Good store discount, good benefits."
bad,"Although I was a veteran in the department I was in, I would still get hassled over what I had to get done that day. I already had a routine of how to get things done by the end of the night and had to train some of the new people in the department. Even though I was recognized as one of the top people in the grocery department, I still got overlooked for promotions and moving up. On top of all that one week I would get decent hours five work days a week and then the next week, without warning, I would get my hours cut drastically from five work days to two work days. Some days when the lines up front were packed, because lack of cashiers, on top of closing down my department (occasionally by myself) I was also called up front to help bag groceries, which I have no problem helping out my fellow co workers but at the end of the night, if my department wasn't in top shape I would get in trouble. The hardest part of my job was having to deal with micro managing by some of the managers. As far as the workplace it was filled with vibrant people that were always able and willing to help. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping out customers."
bad,"great customers-friendly, they shop there all the time. Management has a hard time keeping employees informed and trained. Sprout is a great store with great product. part time means less then 10 hours a week. (sucks) benefits are good if you make the hours."
bad,"You can work here if you want to give your entire life to this place. Management is awful and never communicates. Upper management just comes in once a quarter and tells you all of the things you are doing wrong. No help. Love the customers, not upper management."
bad,"I worked at Sprouts for 11 months as a cashier. I was told upon hiring that I would need to have complete open availability, however they often didn't schedule me full-time and sent me home when it was slow. I needed to be flexible but when it came to being flexible on their end for their staff, it was never given. Everyone who worked there was miserable and you could see it on the looks of their faces when you walked in to start your shift; it was depressing. That's why I often left my house 9 minutes before my shift, because I had timed how long it would take me to get to work so I would get there exactly when I needed to be there. No more, no less. I could really go on and on about this place being as terrible as it is, I really could, but I don't want to waste any more time than I already have on it. Also, it wasn't all that bad -- I made a couple good friends, I got paid $10/hr, I became more patient and I learned how to expect the worst but hope for the best. But I can't tell you how happy I am to be done at this place. Deuces."
bad,Too much to even explain. I wouldn't work for Sprouts unless your are looking for part time. It's not such a bad part time gig. Spending 40 hours a week there is just miserable.
bad,"Typical day starts out OK you restock produce bins. Clean the floor and keep restocking the bins. you are hired as fulltime, but get part time hrs.,management is all right but not great. The store and Coworkers make the job."
bad,"Lots of empty promises, lazy and poor management, say they can't afford to give more hours but hire more people, yet they're still seriously understaffed so you can never keep up with the workload and are expected to do more"
bad,"management was always changing, never had a stable team, one day we had one set schedule, another we would had to adjust to another because we had a completely different manager"
bad,"co workers would be the best part, everyone is friendly and gets along. the customers are mostly friendly,management is a mess, they are lazy, do not care for their employees."
bad,A typical day at work consisted of me running around doing whatever people told me to do. I learned to be very patient and work at a fast pace. Management wasn't bad or good. I liked most my co-workers.
bad,"Sprouts wasnt a terrible place to work. The people were all very nice, welcoming and would try to help you in any way possible. The management did have poor communication within one another and the hours were very minimal if you were a front end associate. Breaks often went ignored because we were too busy and management would rarely help on the front end,"
bad,"in a positive and negative way, the job as a meat cutter is great and honest work. you learn a lot about feeding the people and even learning about peoples lives by spectating what the eat in a way. I enjoyed learning how to cut steaks and make handmade gourmet sausage but sprouts as a company is very ignorant and cheap. even with ex meat cutters as an assistant store manager they still didn't know what i was going on back there, nor did they care to truly respect our work."
bad,"I enjoy the people I work with, because they are all nice fun people.  However, the managers have never been able to get my schedule to fit correctly with my school schedule so i have to go in every week to their office and try to sort out a different schedule for each week.  its quite aggrivating and i feel as if they just don't care enough about their employees."
bad,"Like I said above, it was a great environment, but the management seemed to stress the relevance of the job over building the moral that you would think would be necessary to perform better. Overall, the job required some ridiculous work hours. Not the length, but the consistency and work schedule. "
bad,"The management team aren't the brightest crayons in the box. They order a lot of the wrong stuff, which is frustrating, and there's really no room to move up or get a raise."
bad,"I will begin by explaining that this is my first position as a supervisor, and for the most part, has been a good one. Since the buy out from Sunflower to Sprouts the company has undergone many changes within store policies including: safety, breaks, overtime, and labor. All of these things which require a business to run effectively and make the most profit. Recently, I have realized that this new corporate lifestyle has changed the image of a once organic, fun and lively experience into a more big business Wal-Mart oriented function. As I mentioned before, I believe it is a companies most important objective to make money and be successful, but I also believe there is an element of honesty that needs to be involved as well. Marketing off the organic grocery market and actually following following through with what requires of a 'real' farmers market is lacking with sprouts. As a matter of fact, it does not even exist. That being said, imagine this being placed on all the employees. In essence, they are going to slowly weed out former sunflower employees until they hire new employees that do not know any better. This new mentality has changed management and ultimately changed the environment of the store. If you work here you will be required to give 110% with little chances of promotion, and management will constantly be justifying their actions by comparing themselves to you. Overall, I have learned some valuable skills at this establishment, but the work and responsibilities entailed are, in my opinion, are often times not worth the pay. The most enjoyable part of the job"
bad,"Sprouts has great starting pay, but can string you along for raises and promotions. They have many great workers and managers. But there are some managers who's style is abrasive and offensive, which may or may not get addressed. It is a high stress job, but theres always something to do. Hours vary greatly."
bad,"If you looking for a great job sprouts farm not a good place for you to work .why they the boss not even care to give you 8 hours a weeks ,i was a baker from sprouts farm do you know why quiet I'm a man trying to make food on my family table they give me 8 hours a week mmmm that's not sound good sorry job.sprouts farm."
bad,"An okay starter job, but if you are older and have options, then this is not the job for you. I only applied to work here because I needed some much needed work experience, and I feel I got that. It was never meant to be long term."
bad,If you have work with sprouts Makets as a part time its no good because they not gonna taking care your great .part time 15 hours a week that's very said. Some 5 hours a week no good.
bad,"Sprouts was a joke of a job. I worked in produce which was the busiest department so the day went by very quick. My co-workers were terrible people to work with. They were always negative and never came into work with positive energy. Some days they would come into work and not even acknowledge my existence. My manager was extremely cool though, probably my favorite person at the job but he always worked the morning shift. The reason i left was i went on vacation for a month to visit my family and when i came back they only scheduled me a day out of the entire week. I texted my manager and asked if he could schedule me a extra couple days because i was a little low of money at the moment and he never responded to me. So if you are looking to work at sprouts, i wish you the best of luck!"
bad,"The meat department was wonderful but everywhere else was some version of a sh*tshow. Deli is a complete and utter joke with only a couple of employees propping up the department. Produce is ok but must of the worker's are burnt out and I don't know about the other departments to much. Corporate is the absolute worst often passing down new policies that add god knows how much time doing menial bullsh*t with policies only being added never taken away. Management is the worst with frequently employees getting targeted with cut hours, ignoring questions, machinery staying broken for extended periods of time, and most annoyingly frequently supplies running out often days before the next supply truck is due. Overall while I love my department that is the only reason I am still here."
bad,"Be prepared to start with 40hrs and within a couple months they will knock ya back to 30-35 maybe even less depending on the business"
bad,I worked there as a cashier and it honestly sucked. Be prepared to be the only cashier out of 8 registers that are available and customers are constantly annoyed of the long lines even though you can't do anything about it. You must call up managers to the front and they hate being called up so they give you attitude BUT they are the ones to blame for the poor scheduling they did. You will rarely see anyone last more than 4-5 months here. People will constantly complain about management because they do not appreciate the workers that are good. Instead they will take advantage and over work the good workers and not reprimand those that are bad workers. They will just talk about the bad workers but continue to schedule them and make the good workers work harder than they have too. Which is why you see the huge turnover rate and the constant hiring of people that are not qualified for their job.
bad,"typical day- coming in the morning setting up the meat case before 7am everything fresh and cleaned. Then making a list of everything that needed to be done the whole day."
bad,"as a bakery clerk, there were far too many responsiblies needed for a short amount of time. 6 or 8 hours never felt like enough time for all of the duties that needed to be done. management made it feel like it was my fault while I'm literally sweating and trying my hardest. The bakery was also away from everything else in the store, more in the corner of the deli section which also adds to lonely feel of the job. There were never enough people in the bakery department, and they always try to ask more of you, meaning they call you in on your days off. Before I went to the bakery department I was a curtesy clerk, which meant the janitor in a lot of cases and bagger. Sprouts was a lot of things for me and it taught me a lot."
bad,"this is not a good company to work for, management is horrible, company restructured after 4 months working there and it screwed me as my position was eliminated and was demoted cause a workers comp injury"
bad,"Took a long time to get paid, so the pay system was not good. They also wanted me to work more than I could at the time. I did like what I did, it was pretty easy, and the people were so friendly and nice."
bad,"i worked here during school and stayed per other personal reasons. the company does not show care for your indidivual self, management is the only one given credit for what happens at the store for audits and making goals. wages are low due to no grocery union. company is growing and showing good life, but yet continue to have no show for job growth internally, or action to be better, only to make excuses and seem that is a possibility."
bad,the hours that I was scheduled were very long. I stood on my feet the ENTIRE shift and I didn't get to move around a lot. My back pain got so bad on the job that I was scared I would turn my body and not be able to move. The audits were pointless as well. My manager was really nice however and she was very helpful. Two of my head cashiers were super supportive towards me but one of the head cashiers I worked with was extremely difficult to work with.
bad,"The ratio of amount of production needed to be completed and the very allowance of time to complete such production is minimal. Our store is one of the busiest therefore multitasking is a must. Our department was always behind and short handed, making for a stressful and unenjoyable work environment."
bad,"I was passed over 3 times for asst. produce mgr. I have 30 years in warehousing and foods. They hire a friend of the produce mgr. who is 20 and no experience at all."
bad,"Day-to-day, working at Sprouts is enjoyable. Employees and customers are friendly and kind, and the company is great. Benefits and scholarships are available, which is great. The management at the Flagstaff location is less-than great, however. Some of the managers are unprofessional in conduct and even shockingly disrespectful in their relations with employees and customers alike. It's interesting, but overall, if you can brush off weird interactions with management, it's a really great job."
bad,"Woking at Sprouts Farmers Market consisted of walking in, swiping my card to ""clock in"" and then back behind the deli counter for the rest of the day. The hours would go by fast because I there was always something to clean, slice, or prepare. Working at Sprouts taught me the importance of scheduling and thinking ahead to stay on top of things. The employees at Sprouts were very nice and welcoming, although I did not enjoy working for such a large cooperation.I did get to know the majority of people in my department but the rest of the store seemed life a mystery to me."
bad,"Good discount and always plenty of hours with decent pay, very poor HR and long term benefits. Very hard to move up in management unless outstanding resume with multiple years or friends with current management."
bad,A typical day includes interacting with customers and providing the best service. It is a job that suits those who have school or other pursuits.
bad,"At this workplace you must have great time management skills. Customers always come first and you must find a way to ""just say yes."" My typical day is placing orders, receiving and stocking products, paying close attention to demanding customers and providing recommendations for their needs. Clerks are also expected to answer phones, and the vitamin department works as a team. The hardest part of the job is sometimes ""just saying yes."" This location is very demanding. The most enjoyable part of the job is building relationships with customers and seeing the regulars on a daily basis."
bad,"My co-workers can be such awesome people and I made some life long friends working here.  Yet, when Sunflower was bought by Sprouts and then they became public, the atmosphere of ""Work Harder for Less"" really set in. The company became less efficient, i.e. now taking 2 weeks to get a person hired, and the mind set of working every department with no staff.  Customer service is the number one priority but the standards can not be up held when there is no one working due to hours cut.  Also, ask the company how many female regional, CEO, or even store managers they have.  I have yet to run across one."
bad,The culture of the place is very nice. That is about all............. everything else is well............ just............interesting?
bad,Management is stressful. They expect the impossible from each department even when they cut your hours down the bare minimum. When people aren't given hours they quit and look for jobs other places and shifts are basically skeleton crews because the company is sales driven and wants to make as much money as possible. If sales are low they cut hours to balance their loss in profits.
bad,"Overall the culture and environment of Sprouts is nice do to fellow employees, however the management does not communicate among themselves leading to phone calls asking where you are after you had already requested days off with another manager. Additionally management tends to overload work onto a smaller staff rather then hire new staff to take the workload."
bad,"They do not screen their applicants well.  Because the pay is low, they tend to resort to hiring most anyone who applies.  I was over the floral dept which included managerial duties.  I was also in charge of the cheese island which included cutting large blocks of cheese, pricing, stocking, and customer service.  I liked my job assignments at Sprout's because it was challenging and gratifying for me when the day was done."
bad,Always low on supplies and short on staff which makes twice the work for you. Managers make promotion sound exciting but it never happens. It’s an easy job but a lot of work.
bad,Management is poorly trained. Extremely high turnover rate for new hires. Hours for departments are not properly allocated leading to high expectations of large output for without working a full shift. Managers would not train employees in order to limit their abilities to work other shifts.
bad,Opportunities for advancement if your willing to sacrifice a lot. Focused more on productivity than on customer service. Under constant threat of discipline if productivity and execution are not met.
bad,"A typical day at work was extremely fast-paced. After a while, I simply stopped taking breaks (except for lunch breaks) because I worked alone and couldn't afford to take breaks. Way too much work for one person to handle, and then management turns around and complains to you and asks why things weren't done 100%. When I expressed my concerns to core management, they stopped talking to me and immediately cut my hours. I personally have witnessed them try to bully people into quitting. I was easily the hardest worker in my department. Even coworkers in other departments knew this, and yet management refused to acknowledge my hard work and continued to mistreat me. I give this job two stars instead of one only because I met some awesome people at this store and will genuinely miss my coworkers."
bad,"Or at least, in some areas it may be a living. In the Denver Metro Area it's difficult to scrape by on what you're paid. The potential this job has to make you happy varies from store to store, manager to manager, person to person. My experience there was difficult, but yours may not be."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working for Sprouts as they overwork you and can't guarantee you hours when as a full-time associate you are guaranteed 32. Poor management skills, poor communication, spoken to without respect, etc."
bad,"very poor training and lack of supervision.  did not have proper equipment to work in the freezer.  Overall very disappointing!!"
bad,"Overall, I didn't really enjoy working there. The management was very poor and working there was very hectic. I worked in the deli and it was always very hectic. A lot of cleaning and unnecessary frustrations. Too many things to do and cannot focus on the quality. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new friends in my department and other departments."
bad,"A typical day was trying to keep up with a workload that needed more help but the hours just weren't there. "
bad,"Typical day at work is busy on the weekdays, I learned how to deal with customers who are having a bad day and new products. The management sucked because they didn't know how to deal with customers and they weren't flexible with hours and employees. My co-workers where amazing it was an awesome experience making new friends. The job was not hard at all. Most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things about the local customers."
bad,CEO tries to instill a culture of helping people live healthier lives through food and vitamins and treating employees with respect but sadly his message is lost at district and store level management. Department managers are intimidated and overworked and all other employees are underpaid. Fast food restaurants pay more. Gossiping and backstabbing are overlooked by management and corporate and bullying of department managers is encouraged. Store managers who refuse to lead by intimidation are terminated. The real shame is that Sprouts has a loyal customer base and could be so much more profitable if it supported it's managers and lead by acquiring their loyalty versus their fear.
bad,"Sprouts is a great place to work if you're just looking for a place where you can have a friendly environment and great coworkers.  After working there for two years and talking at length with supervisors and managers, I couldn't be more disappointed in how a company treats it's employees."
bad,Getting to work early and preparing for the day.  I learned that no two days are a like and we set the mood for the day with positive attitude.  Management was good to me and always lent support and advice when needed.  My co-workers were all very much on the same page with the common goals of keeping our customers happy.  The hardest part of my job was having to reprimand a fellow employee for violation of store policy.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working cohesively as one moving machine to deliver the best of our group of employees.  Offering excellent customer service and satisfaction to all who enter our store.
bad,"Sprouts has many different departments that you could work in such as the deli, dairy, produce, meat, bulk, or even be a courtesy clerk. These positions all range in pay but each department has potential to work your way up to higher pay."
bad,"Company transitioning from private to public traded during my time there."
bad,i stocked things from the back and would put them on the shelf. i faced perfectly because at this store they would take pics for adds . i worked with a friend i lived with
bad,"Employees never feel appreciated, they work you very hard, with terrible pay.   The turnover is huge, people just don't show up for work.  its out of control."
bad,"Started at sprouts not too long ago and already I’m seeing some major issues in the company. I have over several years worth of retail experience and was only offered 9.00 to start as a cashier. Nearly everything else in my area is paying at least another dollar or two more. I will be looking for another job due to this."
bad,"I worked at sprouts for just over 3 years and I'm currently looking for something better, because I genuinely feel disrespected by the amount of time I've put in. I have never received a raise despite having been there for so long, and the turnover rate is so high, that I've outlasted the entire management staff. Twice. Don't work at sprouts. You can do a LOT better somewhere else."
bad,"The company overall isn't too bad. However, the store I worked at was a different story. The store didn't care about the customers whatsoever, & my direct supervisor was so particular on things that didn't affect generated revenue or customer satisfaction. He also blamed random things on random people without rhyme or reason. What didn't help were the new rules & policies, which once again, didn't do anything but made our jobs that much more difficult."
bad,"It's definitely the most unnecessarily stressful job I've had. As a cashier, if I accidentally put in something twice or if I mistyped a PLU code, I would have to page a manager to fix it instead of being able to fix it myself (even though the customer could see everything on the screen). This would inevitably lead to the manager coming by and scolding me for an issue that could have been solved in a much more timely manner. There would often be two or more general managers at a time and they would give me contradictory instructions, meaning I would have to choose who to tick off."
bad,"When I first started the store manage at the Dallas store on Marsh Land was excellent. However he left and the new manager should not be allowed to manage a kennel much less a store."
bad,"very overwhelming, only wanted to hire experience workers and not newbies, I was a newbie and had conflict with my manger from the beginning, I heard her talking to others about not liking me and her and another employee bullied me for a day or two. I felt discriminated from my experience and my race. I am white as well."
bad,"A normal day at sprouts will take a lot out of you and I was fairly in shape even back then, compared to now, but the constant need for people to be moved produce to the stands was too much."
bad,"Biggest complaint is that they do not provide enough hours and the little hours you do get have recently been cut down."
bad,"Depending on management, some workdays are bearable. The location of the store can also be a factor, but overall it's their lack of decent management that makes this company lackluster to work for. They could careless about the wellbeing of their employees, so much so that they'll be passive aggressive enough to force anyone they don't ""like"" to quit. It's really childish and a shame to see a big company like this be run my immature louses."
bad,"Overall a newer company with many opportunities that come with that. In my role as Store Manager this gave me the opportunity to develop, mentor and lead 100+ team members newer to the workforce."
bad,"I had friends and the work wasn't too hard, but management and corporate were awful. There was a large amount of boot licking and condescending behavior."
bad,The sprouts I worked at did not have the best management. Hours were steadily getting cut due to them hiring more people then we needed at our store location.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is my coworkers and talking with our regular customers. Major issues with management, to much moving around which affects moral in the store."
bad,Upper management have an extreme lack of understanding of what it takes to work in certain Departments. Make it work for you and leave when necessary.
bad,"A typical day would involve numerous activities. Much of what our tasks revolved around were operations, product analysis, customer relations and sanitization."
bad,"Poor quality seafood that has often started to go bad, much lesser quality poultry and meats, overpriced shelf items, and cashiers who purposely over ring bulk items in stores favor."
bad,"good place to work not enough hours."
bad,The work force itself is great but management was always in question when it came to how the store was ran. There was quite a few workplace fights and violence/insults in the workplace during my time there.
bad,"I loved my customers, and to this day I am still in contact with a few of them. I was given the responsibility to create recipes, and do cooking demonstrations, which I enjoyed."
bad,I highly recommend that you do not work here. It is not a great work environment. Management level employees tend to let personal things cloud judgement.
bad,"cut hours always on the go, management needs to improve how they talk to the workers, and give them better pay and more hours, co workers could help out more"
bad,"Put under a lot of stress, and constantly given more tasks. May or may not have time for lunch. Rarely given notice unless not completed all given tasks perfectly."
bad,"My typical day consisted of scanning various grocery items, taking different types of payments, and helping customers. Management was very lazy, and unorganized."
bad,"15-20hrs a week, no benefits your first year, you will venture into different departments with no added pay. you get paid every Friday. the manager throws out a lot of food instead of donating. you wont get extra hours if you ask those are saved for management and assistant management. Co workers are amazing. the manager really works with your schedule to give you the time you need for school and personal life but you will not make enough to pay bills."
bad,"A typical day at work was usually hectic, always short staffed. I learned that you really cant take things personally from staff or customers. The management never usually listened when you needed help or something was wrong, when you requested days off you never got those days off, plus you never get the hours you need. The co workers weren't very good with communication AT ALL, you never knew what was going on or what needed to be done when. The hardest part of the job was so many miss communications all the time. And the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know SOME of the co workers that were there, otherwise it was never a very enjoyable experience for me."
bad,"meeting new people "
bad,There are a few communication based issues that really need improvement in this company.
bad,"High turnover rates, low raises, overworked, under appreciated, little incentive, no encouragement, non reactive HR, non reactive management, higher ups and bigwigs show little interest in what employees have to say whether it be positive or negative."
bad,Not enough hours. managment could be better. they offer discounts and team member appreciation week . they use cheap labor. cant understand why they are hiring when they can barley afford their own employee.
bad,"working for sprouts has been an experience, they definitely work with your schedule, but the pay isn't worth it, and theres a high turn over rate. Management is horrible, I honestly wouldn't recommend anyone to work for this company, and if you do, don't make it a career choice."
bad,"I was a employee for 4 years before I decided it was enough. Poor pay raises , policy's change left and right , new programs with no help or hours corporate ran now . Changed so much the past couple years, used to enjoy it !!!!!  There are good managers out there but also bad ones who I will never understand how they became a leader ."
bad,"go through deli counter and check for dates and do rotation, prepare salads, sandwiches and other production items, slice deli meat for customers, clean work area, cook roasted chickens every 4 hours, maintain health standards."
bad,"If your applying to a new store, they crowd you out with low hours after three months. Hours get cut very dramatically out of nowhere. It didn't just happen to me, it happened to the entire store. The salary is deceiving compared to the amount of hours worked. Bulk was a chill easy job, but I recommend Publix or Walmart if you want consistent hours."
bad,"I worked for sprouts for 5 years and made a name for myself within the company. I was promoted from clerk to department manager in less than 2 years and became an all-star trainer. Once the company went public, the work environment started to decline. My produce departments across 4 stores I worked through, each did $65k+ a week and I used to get 300+ employee hours a week. Once they went public, department hours across the store(s) were cut by nearly 50%. This meant that employees could possibly receive full-time work at the expense of actual man power. My department was decreased to nearly 180 hours a week for an 8 man crew for a produce department that never dipped below $65,000 a week and did more depending on the sales and holidays. Because store management failed to uphold any corrective action towards employees, much of the staff became lazy and insubordinate. As department managers we were not allowed to carry out any corrective action beyond cutting hours so we had to communicate any problems to store management. The problem lied in their follow through or lack there of. Many of us managers continuously cried out for help but we never received it or were completely ignored. I left because my health was declining from the amount of unnecessary stress and the absurd amount of physical labor. I went far above and beyond the duties of my position to ensure that my department didn't fall apart and it was never enough for management even when they new most of my crew refused to listen, work or even show up to work as scheduled and there was nothing I could do beyond cutting"
bad,"The Store manager made me uncomfortable and he was very odd. All the other managers didn’t seem to have they head on. The Store Manager has charges dropped of touching and being too sweet while he was there and continued to be there. The work is great and the coworkers are even more great. But be prepared for the management, they some rude people"
bad,Great job. Management seems to always be on your side. They treat you as humans and not numbers. Only downfall is not a lot of hours to give. You’ll work 5 days but only get 20 hours
bad,"great products, fun place to work, poor upper management, poor department management, I honestly can say that because they don't focus on training new employees very much. always seems to be there is no labor for the excuse. sprouts also has a very high turn over and was also voted #6 for the worse choice of employment. the culture is great, variable shifts and no overtime. if the company was better ran this would be a great choice of employment. upon loosing my job after 15 yrs of service, they eliminated my position and restructured the management positions. I lost 90 hours of vacation pay as well, however they did offer benefits to all full time employees."
bad,"I have worked at Sprouts for about 6 months now, and I have enjoyed every second of it. My main problem is they make promises they can’t keep. I was promised 30+ hours, which was granted to me the first couple of weeks. The past month, I have been receiving less than 20 hours a week. This week, I am scheduled for 5 hours. Next week, I am scheduled for 4 hours. I have expressed my concerns to several managers as I am a college student and need to make monthly payments. They promise that I will receive more hours, yet I only see them go down. I have asked if I am doing anything wrong or if I need to improve and they assure me that I am doing ‘excellent’. There is clear favoritism within and those are the people who receive the most hours regardless of whether they do a good job or not."
good,Poway sprouts farmers market was a terrible place to work. Upper management and and the way things were handled there was poor and unsatisfactory. I don’t recommend working there
good,"I loved being a HC when it came to the customers and taking care of my coworkers I was ""above"" however, the managers were never on the same page and loved handing out "" Write ups""."
good,Managers are more focused on being friends with employees rather than helping the company be profitable. Management also lets confidential information out to fellow co-workers leaving no privacy.
good,"Office politics. Strict bureaucratic rules. Mistakes are not forgiven. Grudges are held.  "
good,Management was horrible. No communication between management  and employees except if you were their favorite. Horrible at giving feed back and encouragement to employees. Promised me at the interview that they would start me out at $9.50 an hour but then only gave me $9.00 without talking to me about it.
good,Sprouts was a fun place to work only because i worked with the best co-workers and managers. Night managers would reconize your hard work and they would give out $5 Sprouts gift card which would come in handy.
good,This was a hard place to work the y demanded your department was clean stocked but you where not allowed any overtime to your staff and if your staff did not follow directions there was no consequences.
good,The manager that came in was really rude and racist and UN lawfully fired me....then lied about last check didn't get till month later and he literally went to every section and fired every Hispanic there
good,"This is a nice place to shop- any of the stores. The store I applied to was nearest my home. This store's management simply did not manage well. The hardest part was the scheduling, constant cutting hours, and just coordinating shift changes smoothly. Most everyone was friendly overall, but crazy shifts and cut hours hurt morale."
good,"Loved my job, working outside with no boss around to tell you what to do, you just do your job and got to get to know your golfers on the course."
good,"I've worked here for almost three years and in that time my pay has only increased .84 cents. Also managers select employees based on personal relationships as opposed to work ethic. Take a job with this company only if you are content with little advancement, low pay, and shotty management."
good,"I have the skills to manage a dept. They lost an opportunity to experience good management from someone who had a passion for nutrition, enjoyed customers, and had a good work ethic."
good,Fast pace company will cut hours and leave you by yourself and store management wont help you out if you asked .The turn over rate is like 70 percent there always new hires .
good,"Rude customers, no appreciation from management, you are treated like you are easily replaceable. Fast turnover rate. You are the mess cleaner, whether it is for spills or for fixing customers problems."
good,"I worked for the company for 20 years and was always passed up for promotion and I had to train my own boss, hours were all over the place good to work if its short term not for advancement within the company"
good,"We went through several store managers after they got rid of all the good, consistant managers. I ended up quitting because I was the most experienced person on the registers and knew how to do everything a manager does and the management refused to promote anyone inside of that department but had someone who was kicked out of another department who knew nothing of the produce numbers be the manager. Whew... Sorry about the rant guys."
good,"The labor wouldn't have been so bad if not for the managers and the expectations put upon the laborers. Often times the management would leave us short staffed to save money for corporate, there were constant hour cuts and weeks where employees were sent home from shifts early, leaving everyone else with double the work to do by themselves."
good,"I worked morning, day, and evening shifts since I am in college. They will work around your schedule most of the time unless there is a call-out. The managers I had simply did not have good time management and were hardly on the floor when needed. Breaks and lunches are often delayed or not given at all if the store is busy due to poor scheduling. They will often assign you to a different department, one you may not know about. As for advancement, there was favoritism at the location I worked."
good,"All I can say is management is unreliable and unaccountable, co-workers are bitter and overworked, and the pay grade is still capped at 10.50/hr. I wouldn't recommend this place unless you're at the end of your rope."
good,"the politics here are ridiculous and the managers are heavily into favoritism... the co workers are okay, and the day is  really long."
good,"A typical day writing orders calling department, leading employees on what needs to be done on the day, doing inventory breaking loads. Hardest part is training new employee's every 6 months with no experience with people they hire. The most enjoyable is the people you work with and meet."
good,"sorry not interested in doing a review,  looking to leave based on the way management treats the employees.  One day they are really nice and fun place to work, then suddenly its like your not welcome there anymore"
good,"Sprout's is one of those companies that really appreciate if you don't have a life outside of work. They thrive off individuals who are willing to sacrifice working off the clock to get stuff done and not get paid for it, even if they don't realize it. If you have things that you'd like to have time for, like spending time with loved ones and friends, they'll make you feel bad for even asking if you can have free time. It's about the company and customers, not the employees. Oh, also say goodbye to breaks and lunches. The fact that they're usually understaffed means that they're gonna need you to work through those too to make sure that a department isn't left unattended instead of going out and hiring enough people to make sure everyone is treated like a human."
good,"Its very hard work, youre usually the only courtesy working at a time, meaning all work is on you, no help what so ever from managers or other departments."
good,"Company policies and planning are near impossible for floor workers to achieve given time periods and list of responsibilities while being underpaid, understaffed and inside a building that does not meet the goals of corporate."
good,Only company I have ever worked for that expects you to fix all the problems that exist when your hired in the first week. No one can agree on what directions to give you.
good,"I started out as a full-time employee and after 2-3 months, I was getting 25-27 hours.  Had 2 managers, neither one all that great...one was a terrible communicator and insulting, the other didn't care about what work schedule was better for some than others and seemed to give you exactly the opposite of what you asked for."
good,Their pay was horrible. I couldn't make enough to pay bills. Asked for full-time and never received it. Management was very poor and asked for to much at a very low pay.
good,"if you are looking for temporary work this is the place. If you are looking for long term career go else where, They do not pay anywhere near what competitors pay and management is terrible."
good,"Everything that was rated was from truth. The knowledge learned is unlimited, but advancement due to race is very prevalent. There is no advancement for anything that has a brown face."
good,"Typical day consisted of helping customers at the counter, either slicing specialty meats and cheeses or making sandwiches. If not helping customers at the counter then packaging cupped cheeses and salads for the sales floor. Job duties were fairly easy."
good,The management was the worst of all. all of them under trained with egos that are undeserving considering the ignorance levels. Too many people not held accountable in higher positions. I loved working with the customers most of all and really enjoyed the training modules and working with the vendors.
good,"Standing on your feet for hours. Packing groceries, cash handling. The hardest part of the job is standing in one place.  The easiest part is working with different customers all day long.  The most enjoyable for me is seeing what others are buying at the store.  I learned a lot about fruits and veggies and sku numbers."
good,too much micro management and lack of logic and reasoning day to day. too many employees who were fed up and bitter. poor working environment and atmosphere. no advancement.
good,"Just one of those places where you work but don't make a career out of, multiple reasons and unfortunate events led me to leave and not try to reapply."
good,I have been involved in the nutrition industry off and on since 1974 and enjoyed working in the vitamin department.
good,"Overall, working there is fine but it's not a place for a career. The management here is out of control and there are people in positions they are highly under qualified for."
good,"Even after taking over a senior management position for a year, I was still denied a promotion from Analyst. Just like any other corporate environment, if you don't fit into their box, you will struggle to achieve your goals."
good,"Management I worked with were awful and never spoke or communicated with one another. Hours were always crazy & I worked so much for sprouts when other employees called  in beginning so I finally said enough, because I was on disability and when I stopped they stopped treating me kindly. Now I’m back in CA interviewed with two men managers back in Santee, CA & they won’t hire me I gave 2 wk notice. I think it’s my age!!!!"
good,"They put a young person in a store manager roll and she didn't know exactly what she was doing. So she eventually was fired herself. I'ts bad"
good,"I like working at sprouts and i was good at my job, but they consistently don't give me enough hours. Therefore, i am on a mission to find a new/ or second job so i learn something new and meet new people."
good,"At time of hire I was promised 32 hours per week; the first 3 weeks that was true. Then they hire more clerks and promise them the same. Once you get used to the weekly routine, hours are lessened. "
good,"I can't speak for all Sprout's but the one I worked at in Albany, Ca has a huge turnover mostly due to the fact the Manager treats everyone horribly, I was promised benefits I never received, I was told I would be working full time but they scheduled me whenever was convenient for them sometimes 30 hours a week, sometimes 47 hours a week. I really enjoyed my position in Produce and working at a fast pace and helping customers in the store, I feel the position was perfect for someone like myself, however the bad outweighed the good and I couldn't keep myself in such a toxic workplace, being a newlywed and trying to start a family."
good,Bad place for you how do you drive form La Jolla tontustin sfter bring home for less that 4 hrs  to Min you thet the border is always backed up. Aweful management  they should tell prpipe rukes and have multiple places to clock in
good,"Only cleaned when inspections were coming up, treated the employees terrible, and payed based on experience. Would not recommend this job to anyone i know."
good,This company needs to pay the workers better. The way the raise is calculated is horrible. They keep hiring bs Store Managers. The store manager I last had didn’t know what he was doing. It was like he wasn’t trained. He also didn’t know how to talk to people.
good,"was once a good company to work for, being forced to work overnights/grave yard shift for the past year in a department manager position without being able to get off overnights. I'm unable to advance in the company and unable to step down to a different position. I know I'm a valuable asset but now it's to the point where I'm unhappy, physically and mentally drained due to being short staffed and struggle to sleep during the day hours."
good,"Fast pace, always running around, some heavy lifting, customer service, stocking, food perp, shrinking out outdated items. Its not my first choice of a place to work."
good,"Management and corporate does not care about employees or customers, just profit. Hires employees and three weeks later cuts hours. Work life balance does not exist. Regionals make promises but don't keep them."
good,This particular store lets the dept. managers run the store and they are not qualified to do so. No people skills and they don't relate just yell and scream and put down their employees that is in every dept at this store. Main store mgrs have no control at all very poorly run store.
good,"a typical work day was easy"
good,"I have been an employee for several years at Sprouts. I really enjoy fellow employees and customers. The environment of Sprouts varies and the culture has changed dramatically from the beginning til now. Management and their moral has a huge impact on store performance. It starts from the top. Regionals are unsupportive, unrealistic and arrogant when speaking to staff at Sprouts. Since going public, it’s not about customers or the staff that keeps this company going. It’s about that dollar that the can save everyday."
good,"Sprouts was not a bad company to work for. Not perfect by any means, but the best company I have worked for so far. The pay is pretty good with chances for raises and advancement. Although they do pay better than most places, Sprouts tends to cut hours like crazy one week you'll have 40 hours then the next you'll have only 16 hours. It's pretty random due to the electronic scheduling system they use. It's very hard to get fired from this job l have to be intent on losing it in order to lose it."
good,Love the fresh produce and the best organic fruit. Discount help too. Liked the people I worked with. Very fast pace and you will learn a lot about food.
good,Starts out exciting but over time becomes stressful. Not enough people so that puts stress on current employees to help the customers with no help and expect everything to be done in a six hour period is impossible with no overtime. Nothing gets done and don't have enough time in the day to complete everything for the customer. Makes the store look nasty.
good,"good place to work for younger people, not a place to chase a career. large amount of disorganization among the workplace/staff"
good,I enjoyed working there and loved most all of my customers. Some managers are awesome. Others 2 thumbs down. I have learned that workplace bullying really does exist and management has no idea how to address it. Especially if those bullying are dept heads. It becomes a very unhealthy and toxic environment.
good,"I dislike working there. No place for advancement. The only enjoyable part were some of the other employees. Reviews are a joke, there is no way to get a decent raise if any after the review."
good,Very busy environment. Always something to do and the lifestyle and products were nothing but healthy and beneficial for ones self. Overall was a good working environment.
good,the management is terrible and some of the staff will treat you worse... there's really nothing more i can say about it other than there's a snake in the nest...
good,"Cashier, greeting customers, restocking the floor. I love meeting new people and learning new things. Facing items in the store, closing other departments like deli."
good,did not really like working here but i needed the money. managers had favorites and were horrible to the new people making them do things they werent supposed to and then getting mad about it. the other employees are somewhat nice but everyone has their own groups they hang out with so if you are a newbie you get singled out.
good,"I wouldn't recommend working at the Oakland location for any position. Everyone is stressed, overworked, underpaid, understaffed, and underappreciated. Management looks whooped everyday. I can go on and on. Any other location I recommend to work at and/or shop any day of the week."
good,"If you have the right attitude you can go places, be ready to work.  Much like any employment environment it's all about who you know.  It's physically demanding."
good,I loved my section but not management as a whole and I don’t think the wages were fair or equal to the work I was doing.  I did learn a lot about retail and customer service which I was great at.
good,"it is an easy job. the work is not hard, but the management and lazy employees make it stressful. it's hard to work when the morale of the department is so low."
good,People that I worked with were great management was different they had no managerial etiquette to them and did what they wanted and left you responsible.
good,"Unreliable Work shifts,Working Hours,2nd & 4thManager & HR except from store manager one who was awesome..Don’t expect too much on this place due to most every one on higher position was amateur or just barely gotten that position like training mode."
good,If you're looking for a full time job this is not the place. If you're looking to be able to make a living this is not the place. Most times I have been left alone to cover 3 departments. Department managers usually leave the bulk of the work for clerks to do. Minimal communication between management and department clerks.
good,"Alright place to work not much else, everyone at the minimum helps one another out, but will not go the extra mile for one another. Everyone takes care of their own."
good,"- Clean up work area and opened the lane. "
good,"They promised me 32 hours per week. It was that way for maybe 2 weeks, then BOOM, cut down to 20 hours a week. No advancement and I only got one 20 cent raise the whole time I was there."
good,"I interviewed with the store manager.  I told him I could only work 20 to 24 hours a week, because I was taking care of my parents. He said the first 2 weeks will be busy, because it's the grand opening. 5 weeks later, I'm still working 32 to 40 hours, and every week was a different day and time. The schedule comes out late Friday, for the next week, which never gave me enough time to schedual appointments. They don't train you. They just expect that you know what you're doing. Don't expect to be trained."
good,I wouldn't make this job your career. As I've said they make promises they don't keep. New hires with no experience get paid more than those that have worked there longer or that have more experience. It is difficult to move up.
good,The specific store I worked at was unprofessional and the management was lacking in basic employee relations and problem solving. The whole store revolved around gossip and drama.
good,"Poor work culture and work life balance. A lot of promises made and not followed through on. The expectations is ridiculous, management knows it and they don't care. The team of people themselves are awesome, the company just wants to much out of some of them."
good,Stressful environment where hours to complete the task doesn't match the amount of work needed to be done. Spent many days either not getting breaks or skipping lunch's because the produce department was always behind or short-handed. Most times new hires were put into the schedule with no training whatsoever. Not uncommon to have managers that have no people skills. Some even talk to you in a demeaning threatening manner.
good,Culture is pushed in the wrong ways.  Too much being faked and its turning people off.  Working more people at part time levels doesn't work and tags on more work to the management team.  Time for change Sprouts.
good,"Management plays favorites, job tasks are fairly simple, but the workload is sometimes too much for one person. There isn’t very much room for growth in the company if you don’t know someone higher up or have a relationship with one of the managers."
good,a typical work day is busy with customer request every so often.customers make your job and enhances your personel customer service skills.the hardest part of a job is when a customer thinks he or she is 100% right about something they saw in an ad but it was for another grocery store.
good,"It depend on who you are at Sprouts they can be very bais at time. I could not stand the manger I work with he was very arrogant."
good,"I worked as a courtesy clerk and a bulk department worker. I don't understand how someone who does work all around the store, inside and out, is paid the least out of everyone. Then when I transfered to bulk, I wasn't given a raise even though transfering to another department meant a raise. They tried to argue that I'm still a courtesy clerk despite the store manager SIGNING the papers that led to my transfer of departments. The hours were short and there wasn't a long list of things to do for your shift."
good,"I have worked for the Company for 5 years. I have faced many health issues, some managers were great, understanding, and sympathetic, many more were less so. "
good,"Rotate product and maintain cleanliness of department "
good,"Good benefits if you are in management, corp and upper management has terrible communication, and doesn't treat people with respect. They expect a lot for little pay."
good,Good job at the the end of the day they just need to get better with their scheduleing and management and if they do that they will be just alright in my eyes
good,"A work day was constantly bagging customers groceries, collecting carts and cleaning the store floors. I only got a 30 minute beak and was mostly running around performing my required tasks."
good,no place to work if you want to advance or have 40 hours a week. Benefits were minimal at best and the management was horrible. No guidance as to job specifics.
good,I loved working with my coworkers. Day to day tasks were enjoyable due to the team like mentality each worker possessed. The turnover rate was tremendous however; this was an effect from poor management and lack of advancement in the company.
good,"Sprouts is a really fast-paced job which I liked because the work days flew by, however the management can be really unprofessional at times. I was doing management work but getting paid regular employee pay."
good,"Hours were very inconsistent and some weeks were 16 hours or less. Skill was not recognized, hard work not rewarded, scheduling was not performance based."
good,The store manager I had sexually harassed women. I was not allowed to transfer to another store. People were doing drugs in the freezer. Hard workers were not  compensated.
good,"the company overall is great, but the local store manager is terrible, brings down the overall energy of the store. You walk in and you already dont want to be there"
good,"Under-appreciated, underpaid, unnecessarily stressful, and ridiculous management. Some departments are fine and some have unrealistic expectations. Small chance of advancement."
good,Need better management ad more advancement. Working here as a courtesy clerk is stressful. We are underpaid for all the work that we have to do. Most of the courtesy clerks that started with us when the store opened have quit.
good,"Safeway or Walmart would probably treat you a lot better. Don't quote me on that but this place sucks! They are terrible at treating their employees for all the hard work they do and for the less pay they get. I Left Trader Joes to be a Bulk Foods Manager for Sprouts and that was the biggest Mistake I have ever done to my Career in the grocery game. Trust me, Don't it. Wholefoods, Trader Joes and any other Health food stores would be the better option"
good,I worked there for almost a year and because of lack of leadership as well as low wages it's been very hard to find and keep consistent employees.  This is a good company for those with a plan to go to school because they're willing to work with school schedules
good,I have nothen to say about the store.its poorly ran an inconsistant.what only the managers make money? no life is tuff your work place should be a place of happiness. at least a little
good,"The store started off great but then management got to comfortable, the store manager was rude to people with disabilities which i found bery disturbing . Bus coworkers were nice and team leads made the best of it"
good,"My typical work day was great if the manager would of gave me hours to work with. I worked with a lot nice people but the problem is the company would not give me hours."
good,Sprouts DOES NOT take care of the employees that have been there for a while.  they pay the new hires more than the more experienced employees..  pay sucks
good,"I was a courtesy clerk so I was in charge of collecting carts, cleaning up messes, and bagging groceries for customers.  I learned how to work under pressure and multitask.  I was difficult to multitask sometimes but I enjoyed being able to help customers."
good,Sprouts is a good part-time job but there are some management problems that don't seem to get addressed because they rotate managers constantly. Pay doesn't seem adequate for workload. Employees feel unheard.
good,I was put on a schedule that I specifically said in my interview that I would not be able to work and they still put me on it. They were very inconsiderate and unprofessional.
good,I stayed because I genuinely wanted to have customer service under my belt but the actual co-workers is just drama. You got females dating multiple guys in the work place and it just becomes chaotic even when you try to stay out of it. Not much room for advancement.
good,A typical day at Sprouts at my location is very fast paced and can at times be stressful. I handle all the money with the registers which is a great deal of responsibility. I have learned how to manage/supervise over 15+ people throughout an 8 hour work day. Along with making sure all paperwork and money are filed correctly and efficiently. Unfortunately most head managers from my experience only dictate from an office and aren't very much help. The hardest part of the job would be making sure all money and paperwork are filed and inputted correctly without any flaws. As flaws would reflect badly on store audits. The most enjoyable part of the job would be making customers happy and want to revisit the store.
good,"Sprouts just needs to make a few key changes in operation and I think the company would be a way better place to work. The workers are in and out like cockroaches at a motel. Many are underpaid and overworked then yelled at when they get 15 minutes of overtime. The Sprouts on Manchaca Road in Austin, Texas has awful management. One of the assistant store managers was unhelpful and seemed irritated to help many customers, he also had no people skills in general. The meat market is a joke, buying meat is like a playing a game of finding the package that won't leak and fall apart when I pick it up. The deli seemed nice. My advice overall is if you want a job, apply here and don't put too much energy into it, it won't be worth it. Collect your money and keep going."
good,job was ok customer were nice. coworkers dident do there job talked to much to other workers.management lets it happen. we had to pick up the slack.
good,"Management is terrible, they do not treat their employees well. The only great thing about Sprouts Farmers Market is their health benefits."
good,"I worked for Safeway and after 3 months of no grocery experience I was promoted to Head Clerk, I thought that at Sprouts the Management would see the same thing that Safeway did but they are not interested in helping me build to a better spot and are keeping at a Grocery Clerk working the closing shifts. I wont stay much longer."
good,"If you want to fill some space in your day for some uncomfortable situations go ahead."
good,This job is good for young people to use for experience. I don’t recommend it for long term because it doesn’t pay enough or get raises for you to want to stay long term.
good,Just like any retail experience sprouts is completely customer oriented but doesn't care much for their employees. Managers make less money than clerks in many cases and corporate does not care about the imbalance between management and employees. They make you work crazy hours to meet company demands and overtime is rarely given out. Overall not the best company to work for if you're trying to make a retail career or even just move up in your current store. There is no incentive for good hard working employees to stay.
good,The job isntime consuming due to low staff and bad turn over ..management and every one spread thin..not much training. Management changes every month
good,"Cool work environment but the management could use some work. It seems to be a blame game most of the time. Only get help from a select few there, not much teamwork."
good,"Better if your management. The hours are always fluctuating, no set days off never know what department youll be in per day,  good if you dont mind constantly changing schedules."
good,Sprouts could stand to pay their long time employees fair wages. Seven years and ended as a senior clerk for 14 and change an hour. A hope they get the hint.
good,"just a very meh job. hours were inconsistent, most coworkers were friendly, customers were okay. not enough pay for the stress. other departments were always short- staffed so lots of being asked to move around"
good,"The experience you get here is worth applying for. Hours are never guaranteed and pay differs from person to person. The connections you make here are what matters, and you'll walk away with more knowledge and some positive experiences."
good,over all it was stressful but i did get my hours. most days people called out and i was left alone. alot of work not enough workers. alot of favor others that you. i worked hard and never got a raise.
good,lots to do not much time to do half of the requirements getting yelled at all the time for something not being done on time guests would get angry the bathrooms got covered in feces and bodily fluids and team members were to clean it up and not given much supplies to do so
good,"Not consistent. Alot of new hires, as people don't stay long. Hours can go from 18-32 hours a week. Fun job, if you are not supporting yourself. Good for high school, seniors on social security or married, and is extra income. But not enough to support yourself."
good,Great job for someone starting in the field of retail but company wont take care of there own mangers. Poor pay for managers putting in 10 plus hours a day. Hey they give you a 15% discount though..
good,Sprouts Farmers Market is an interesting   place to work. It's  fast paced and very demanding. If your young and dont have a family Sprouts is the place for you. If you want weekends off and have a family Sprouts is not. They work you extremely hard and oftentimes you'll work shorthanded.
good,"Too much Corp BS. They have no idea what they are doing. SFM is losing all of the good workers because they are starting new people at higher hourly rates than the long time employees. Then HR and store managers all lie and tell you that they’re going to fix the problem, of course nothing has changed yet."
good,"I really enjoyed working at sprouts when I first started but they would cut my hours so I would be ineligible for certain benefits like insurance, holiday pay etc. Even when you decide to talk to managers to have a meeting to make everyone come together as a team, they make fun of you or shut you down. They're unprofessional and they only care about making money at the end of the day."
good,"The whole vibe of the store is dependent on the store manager.  I worked at 2 Sprouts and they are both completely different.  If the managers are happy and upbeat and pay attention to the employees than the whole store benefits.  If the managers have long faces and no personality, than the store has a heavy energy."
good,It’s OK if you’re in school and you still live at home with your parents. They love young people with little or no responsibilities.  A great social gathering place to work  and social media groups .
good,Always more work then there was time and hands available to do it. Turnover was high and pressure to do more with less was an every day event. Daily expectations were not always possible.
good,"After the dust settled from Grand Opening, everyone noticed a huge cut in hours. Some did not mind, since they were part-time and Sprouts was their second job. For those who were told Full-Time, they left because 20-30 hours does not cut it. Many people looked at Sprouts as a great chance to be apart of something really awesome, but was slapped in the mouth when those people who wanted to depend on Sprouts as their main source of income was reduced to nothing more than a part-time ""lover"". Even when I personally was trying to work with management so I could work in different departments to compensate for the lack of hours, it never happened. I was regulated to nothing more than a 30 hour tool. I tried for 2 months to work with this, but to no avail. The store manager has proven to be selective in who he converses with. I have seen on many occasions where what could be considered as ""favoritism"" (for lack of a better term) or selective friendliness was initiated by the store manager."
good,Lack of hours and no advancements. They state in store promotions all were outside.avg weekly hours for non mgmnt were 30 hours and less mostly around 20 or less
good,"Sprouts would be a great job, if you could get enough hours to justify even going to work. I started with 35-40 hours but after about a month and a half they started reducing my hours to only 12 a week which is not going to pay the bills. After 3 months the let me go which honestly I was probably going to leave anyways due to lack of hours. Funny thing is that continuity hire all the time even get emails on the"
good,I worked their for a year and a half and got a long well with co-workers and management. Can be very busy at times which makes for a fast paced environment.
good,"A typical day at work for me is very non stressful i love making customers happy with the great food i prepare. My job description is very important, i'm the first person who arrives in the deli department to have things set up in a timely manner. Hard word paid off which i got promoted to be a deli senior clerk, their is nothing hard about what i do because i love cooking and providing excellent customer service to people, its just being under paid for the work i do."
good,These store managers are fake and talk behind their own employees back. Instead of helping their employees to improve they tell the ones they like and down them for their job. I have never seen so many people quit or just leave because of the management.
good,"If you're looking for random hours, a whack cast of employees, and a generally mindless job then Sprouts is just for you. If you need consistent hours, care at all about your sanity, or want to work somewhere with people who are passionate about their jobs, then look elsewhere. Managers are micromanagers and generally rude, coworkers will always be an ear to complain to about how much you hate your job- because they do too."
good,"Was a fun environment, great grocerie store,different hours weekly,low pay,was wrongly let go.i'm sorry there is not much else to tell just like working in any other grocerie store."
good,"Started at grand opening of the store, went through management changes after the first year and it was not for the better. Once the company went public, it was no longer a fun place to work."
good,Has a lot of employee appreciation days but barley even appreciates their employees. People come and go often and we are regularly under staffed. Able to have fun a lot but managers are too uncaring.
good,"I think sprouts was a okay job gor me who's first time working in United States. At sprouts my daily job was to make sure both enternces have enough carts for customers, and while I was inside the I had to bag costumers items, and help customers to find their needs."
good,Working at Sprouts has its good days and bad days. Your coworkers can either be your friend or your enemy. There are days that they help you a lot and other days they don't even bothering moving a muscle to help. If someone calls out it's a hassle finding someone to cover the shift so you'll most likely be left alone. The pay is not that great especially for the work load that they want you to put in on a day.
good,"Not a bad place to work but advancements are slim. I was there for two years and got run around and decided to move on to another previous industry. They tell you to stay onboard and we will get you moved up and quickly, mostly favoritism is a determining factor."
good,"NOthing special, you can work at any grocery store and it will probably feel exactly the same as working at sprouts farmers market. No complaints but at the same time not really sending much praise. It's a job."
good,"Although it was an easy job, it was a very stressful environment. Management wasnt the greatest, needs help. Not enough recognition for employees. Not enough hours."
good,"It wasn't the worst job, but the drama and such was overwhelming. The pay wasn't adequate for the station. If you were a cashier and did ONE day if courtesy clerk work a week, you were paid as a courtesy clerk instead."
good,"This can be a fun place to work but but management is petty and vindictive. Your coworkers make the work environment tolerable, but managers tend to micro manage every little detail rather than let you just do your job."
good,"Average, run-of-the-mill day here would include:  aiding customers accordingly with their orders, or being able to point them in the right direction.  In addition, production of products, might be necessary depending on workload for the day.  Every closing shift would also be required to fill any gaps and/or holes in the display cases, not to mention thoroughly clean the entire work area; and organize and log the production sheets for the day."
good,the job helped me find a stable salary and begin to make my life here more organized. I am still needing more hours as the remodel has cut those back considerably.
good,"If youre a student and need some extra cash this is a good job for you, but if you you need real money then look elsewhere because you wont get it here."
good,"Very friendly staff. Unfortunately, the employees do not stay on long. This results in greater stress on the other employees and unfortunately, lower product reliability and consistency. Overall, good place to work."
good,The hardest part of the job is to remember where everything is located in the store. I have learned to communicate with fellow employees on their needs for their departments. The most enjoyable part of the job is the costumers.
good,"A typical day at work is pretty swift and straight forward. The company has the potential to be great, but the organization isn't that good. At least not at the location where I am employed."
good,"Stocking shelves, customer service, ordering frozen food items.  Management does not offer training and when asked questions refers you to others.  The company has a enormous amount of employee turnover.  No job descriptions, expectations, or duties are discussed making accountability impossible."
good,"I was hired on full time in January.  Then in August, with no warning or explanation, my hours were cut to 24-30 per week.  The job also required a lot of lifting in areas that were too small to allow proper lifting techniques for safety to be exercised."
good,"As with every company, the management has its good and bad apples. I was once told by a manager that the turn over rate in one year is 60%. Draw your own conclusions about that. The work is too easy and very repetitive."
good,"Sprouts is not quite a Farmer's market but marketing a healthy lifestyle is their culture. I've worked for the company for years but recently the micro management from corporate is out of control. "
good,the only thing negative i can say is that you never had a constant schedule and it always came out late so you could never plan your life accordenly.
good,"I stayed at this job so long because of the customers. I built amazing relationships with the people that would come in multiple times a week. They were wonderful! Management is another story. They expect you to go above and beyond what your job description is and there is no appreciation for what you do. I was a Head Cashier working at Sprouts for a year and 7 months and I would do my job (schedule cashier breaks, answer phones, count tills at the end of the night, complete 4 random quick counts on cashiers during every business day, write lane assignment sheets, cashier when needed, write down hourly sale logs override customer returns)help in the bakery, help stock in the grocery department, clean and refill the   bulk department on top of deal with customer complaints, and train new cashiers that were hired.  Managers would yell at you if u didn't do what was asked or in the time that they thought it should be done."
good,"Basic deli job."
good,It was a good experience. I enjoyed working there. The store was clean and organized. abcdfghijklomopqrstuvwxyz iflflfamsknfkagnakjbgjkanfgjangkjangjnfdbv jvkfdvkdvnvfv j vjfnvj
good,"Sprouts Deli Department left much to be desired.  With no clear management or direction from higher ups, those that kept an eye on us were unaware of situations of the department or specific protocols often leading to unnecessary incidents or mishaps."
good,"Nice store. I would probably do some of my shopping here even without the employee discount. That discount is a nice perk.I like the customers and working with them. Management is always making dedisions that negatively impact employees and customers. Customer service and customer saticefation are often considered unimportant. Seniority, experience, reliability, knowledge, and excellent production is not important. The store manager will sometomes get in your face and threaten you."
good,Working at sprouts was a good learning experience. While there I learn how complete my task in a timely manner. I also learned acceptable communication and customer service skills. The hardest part of the job was  the expectation of what had to be done in a shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers.
good,Sprouts is an easy company to work for. There isn't a lot of room for advancement when all your bosses care about is that bonus at the end of the year. The people I work with on the other hand are almost like another family to me. Clients are more upscale and always nice. The job is fairly easy but don't expect too many hours.
good,"the part  I like most was to be able to help customers, and learn the different kind of vegetables they like."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was sampling produce all day with customers.
good,"steady at times,hectic in others.some co-workers were great to work with others a hinderence.enjoyable part of the job meeting new people"
good,I worked a ridiculous amount of hours
good,Sprouts is a good and easy job but they will rail on you over the smallest thing and if your late there is no reason good enough that the management accept
good,"The people I worked for were not to bad to work for, and if you have a problem the management, management will look at you and say it retail, what are you going to do. I didn't like a got enough fair warring what days and hours I am going to work for the next two weeks. I like to know what time and days I going to work so I can plan my life around work. Plus, they kept cutting my hours and said it retail, what are you going to do."
good,I enjoy my work at sprouts yet I feel like I am not listened to all the time with my requests for time off even when I ask weeks in advance and the pay is terrible for the amount of work we do.
good,Very excited too work for Sprouts at the beginning.  They have competitive pay and benefits.  The store atmosphere and customer engagement is great.  Company lacks in diversity and internal growth.
good,I enjoyed discovering new healthy options for everyday grocery shopping at a low price.  However I did not like the way management was NEVER consistent. Moral was very low.
good,management was not communicative nor very nice to work for.  most people were nice.  They do not care if you attend school- they just want you at work all the time.
good,"Although the coworkers at Sprouts do their best to create a positive environment, it is impossible to see past the looming shadow of strict management"
good,The job as a head cashier does not pay well enough for the company basically wanting you to fill the role of two jobs. It was very stressful and not rewarding.
good,If youre a hard worker you'll do fine. If you're going to slack off and can't take criticism you'll quit. High turnover rate. Fun coworkers. I was a favorite so I think better of the company than others.
good,"There is no pay bonus for experience in the departments unless you become a manager. Hours are always all over the place, never a set schedule. It was fun to experience the supplements some what, but usually you are just doing retail stuff like cleaning and stocking"
good,"Consisted of dealing with a multitude of customers. Constantly being micromanaged. Not hard of a job, but a lot is expected of you. Taking the friendliness and customer service to an extreme."
good,For the most part I was happy with my job but I wish I had more hours.  Instead of spouts giving employees more hours that have been there a long time they would hire my people and current employees would get less hours and that didn’t make me happy
good,"A typical day at work consist of unloading truck deliveries full of groceries, restocking selfs, filling bulk bins, and helping customers in the process. Working at sprouts I learned better people skills and patients. The management at sprouts isn't very good. Sprouts is very big on customer service. The hardest part of the job is closing which consists of facing shelfs and working back stock. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers."
good,In all honesty I left cause I was being harassed by my manager I had a disability and it got to the point where I had to leave I had employees that liked me and wish I could work there again if I had the option I couldn’t go up in a different department cause my manager wouldn’t let me so I pushed carts I was there for 3 years work my hardest even though my manager said I didn’t know how to do my job it was this way for everyone the communication was bad! Sometimes I’d be by myself all day from 7am to close!
good,Managment made it seem to be a caring work environment and then the whole shift and I get yelled at for the previous shifts mistakes. I like the pay and other small benefits like legal shield and I'd shield but really no one likes being treated like an idiot or a child.
good,"Took this job,  after leaving another healthly type market. At first it was okay,  pay was a little better, hours weren't sparse. The next following months, hours deleted and pay is barley livable, especially since benefits are taken out weekly. Only reason staying is for great coworkers, that have become friends and getting sick and vacation time."
good,As long as your in with management you will be good. Every store is run differently and all managers do not treat workers the same. At times can be a hostile work environment. If you have issues and report it everyone knows your business
good,Depending on who you work with and who manages you it could be relatively easy or you could be dealing with constant issues such as being  under equipped to do your job and having to deal with poor work ethic from other employees.
good,This job cuts every employee of their hours thus having them barely survive for the week. Management does not care for their employees at all. You can hardly have a conversation with management about possible advancement without them wanting to end the conversation right there and then.
good,"There's not much to say, Each department suffers in their own special way. The company takes shortcuts to save money. They won't hire enough people and then underpay the ones they do have."
good,"Managers didn't seem to care as long as the store made money, co workers got high on inhalants/THC on the clock, manager would leave cig butts on ground everywhere, customers were rude."
good,"Poor management, quick turn arounds within company workers. Managers didnt have the integrity to let go of employees but instead would stop scheduling and hope employees would quit."
good,"It was a great place to work for the first year, but there was barely any increase in pay (after 3 years) I hardly got the hours I asked for and the management at my location didn't seem to care about employees"
good,"I got paid good, but the managers were unprofessional and disrespectful. We would have a employee appreciation week and the managers would be cheap and unfair."
good,was a great first job that treated me good until the department manager knew she was leaving soon so she started being disrespectful to me and a lot of my other co workers. she started cutting hours to make people want to leave and it worked with a lot of people.
good,Like having no work-life balance and  constantly fixing regional managements poor decisions for 14 hours a day 7 days a week with low pay ..this is the job for you
good,"Lots of heavy physical labor, or maybe I just love to complain. It's obvious that you're doing all the jobs that no one else wants to do. required to be outside for 20+ minutes in 100 degree heat."
good,"no raises at all, paid $11.00 which is BELOW minimum wage. and being on call is the worst, can't plan anything the day even if they don't need you because they always call late."
good,Sprouts could be a fun place if you get in the right store and have a great manager.  Most managers are too busy to care about helping employees with any problems or helping with store needs. The best part of working at Sprouts is the friends you make working with other employees.  And even though they have Employee Appreciation Day we really don't feel appreciated.
good,this job was pretty good until they began changing companies and the policy changed for the worst. management only looked out for themselves and had a boss who lied to customers and corporate to get promoted to a regional manager.
good,Normal entry level job nothing to complain about. Only thing poor management- managers weren't communicating with each other- poor communication amongst management.
good,"I would rather not leave any comments, I have learned a lot of things working at Sprouts in which I plan to take on with me as I advance my career. I Loved my benefits ."
good,"Sprouts is a high paced place to work, with minimal help.  As a manager you are always under pressure to improve on your numbers with as little amount of labor possible.  You get very little assistance from your upper management to help you."
good,"have to have baked goods out by a certain time"
good,My manager didn't understand my need for a break when I had certain mentality problems. I feel as if they didn't care about my wellbeing and more about my consistency.
good,"good place to work, liked working with the customers and employees, days went by fast when it was busy, i learned how to do audits and count down all the tills when opening and closing the store"
good,"A typical day at work was characterized by some pressure to go faster than as human possible with little or no breaks given by the Head Cashiers. Little communication is had between managers and cashiers because of the Head Cashiers supervising and acting as the middle-man. The management at my location didn't seem to care a lot about their employees only the store running as smoothly and making as much money as possible. The culture claimed to be family/community based, but half the employees either ignored me or were subtly passive aggressive. My main manager didn't even know my name by the time I quit.The hardest part of the job was the customers honestly, but a hard part of the job was making your availability clear despite their scheduling software because it doesn't allow you to put it in when first employed nor within 5 days of the day you aren't available. Moreover, they did not retain the information on my availability that I shared with them following the interview and my employment, so scheduling disputes occurred as a result. The most enjoyable part of the job was honestly learning of and trying new foods, brands, and drinks, as well as the often eccentric and fun customers I had. The hefty discount on in-store purchases was also a great perk of the job. I learned, though, that just because a company has specific values, that doesn't mean they follow them."
good,Hours go up and down depending on how well you work. Some times you even work as one day for three hours. Management does not have their priorities together.
good,It was ok. It was a job for the moment. it was to much work for the pay. But i did enjoy the associates that i work with. Great deals on cheese and food.
good,Very productive over night crew but lack of proper management. Management does not enforce equal job responsibilities throughout all the shifts. Unlikely expectations for specific shifts.
good,"the management that I am under plays favoritism heavily. and when it comes to coaching or otherwise confronting you, communication is lacking. methods of punishment are questionable and runoff some others due to cutting hours."
good,"For a first job or a job to work at while attending school, Sprouts is not a bad place to work. They do not offer benefits unless you work 40+ hours every week. Management could be good or bad since they rotate around a lot."
good,"How can you get ahead or even keep up with there expectations when they and you are always behind, because of the turnover. pay and benefits are not enough to live on."
good,"I leaned that you really only work there for money, you shouldn't put your life into it like I did. I thought I would be with the company for a long time but it seems every day now I want to leave. They make moving impossible, don't move across state and think you'll be in the same position you were in before, they won't let you."
good,Sprouts is a good place to work when you have the good managers working there but when they switch them out it sucks. Bad employees get praise while those who follow rules don't.
good,The job itself is a very detail oriented position with daily changes. I have learned a whole new aspect of the grocery industry. The management in this particular store is not as supportive when it comes to training.
good,"count OOs, stock inventory, assist customers, run demos, consult with vendors and consumers on products and quality. "
good,"at the beginning it was really fun , everybody started getting good hours in other words the workplace was enjoyable but as months passed there was a lot of favoritism and the hours were cut really short."
good,There is a lot of turnover since the wages are so low. Most of the people I worked with were students and retirees. The wages are too low to make a living.
good,fun place to work but low pay and they cut your hours back depending on how sales go. manager gets a bonus depending on how much the staff gets cut back in comparison to the amount of sales.
good,The bookkeeper never works around my school schedule and has given me points because they scheduled me during my school hours and I was not able to attend my shift.
good,"Sprouts has great benefits, and from what I'm told they are offer competitive wages. I have worked for a couple stores during my time with the company. The employees are cool and easy going, which makes transition easy. I would have to say its a good company with everything the offer in benefits and employee programs. But I would have to say management is it's downfall."
good,It's okay for a temporary job. Not anything extreme. It was mostly calm at the store I worked at. Not too busy no too slow. My only complaint is that management doesn't really seem to care about the comfort or schedule restrictions of employees.
good,"To be at Sprouts is fun there are many people who pass our doors and I like to be busy so this is the right place for this.  Management is not good they take more importance to customers and each other, as long as you are in the management position you will be fine with them.  Everybody feels treated as second class citizen at work."
good,"When I first started working here I loved it, the people were great, and the store is interesting. It really is a shame because the place has so much potential, but the complete incompotency that occurs is outragous. They are constently running out of things and no matter how many times the issue is brought up to managment it is ignored. Thus bussiness is lost because everyday you are forced to tell a customer that we ran out of X. Also hours are terrible yet managment will try to squeeze more work out of you with dramaticaly less time to complete a task. If you take pride in your work this place will kill your soul."
good,"Sprouts goes above and beyond to convince potential employees that they will be treated very well, but when it comes down to it, Sprouts is a retail company with retail hours, pay, and beliefs. While I have no problem going out of my way to make a customer happy, I am not fine with the expectation that I am to get eight hours' worth of work done when they cut my hours down to six per day. I am currently working around 32 hours per week stretched out to five days per week with no rhyme or reason to my schedule, making it impossible to get another job to bring my pay up to a livable wage. There is a constant promise for more hours on the horizon to dissuade potential defectors, but they are never realized. I understand needing to cut hours from the perspective of the company, but they should not expect employees to do 40 hours worth of work in a 32 hour week, nor should they promise more hours or an increase of wages with no intention of fulfillment."
good,there  were many busy days at work. customer  service.amazing   co workers. helpings others. completing  task  throughout  day. overall great leaning experience.
good,For about 75% of the time I worked there the management was very one sided and they picked favorites. They would hire more cashiers and then our hours a week went from 30-40 a week to 10-20 a week.
good,"Good starting point for high school kids. Okay benefits, but pricey. Every store is really different from the next, and not a lot of policies are followed. I don't recommend this job for anyone looking for advancement."
good,"No chance to change work schedule, so I never saw my family. Everyone I started with (8) at this location quit or moved on. The company seems to have changed since it started expanding."
good,Though working there was not necessarily bad there are a few things that bothered me.  No recognition for doing a great job and even though you give it your all you don't feel satisfied or fulfilled.
good,"Great products, poor leadership. The hours are severely lacking unless you are lucky enough to be in a sort of management position. They try their best to keep you at or below 20 hours per week."
good,"This company works you hard which is okay. I like to work. Come to work to work not play but, 40 cent raise for working a whole year is a slap in the face. Very degrading."
good,"Greet customers, fill shelves and coolers, face and clean department, and inform customers on the benefits of our healthy foods."
good,"Same as Wal Mart but you had trained staff & the the truck was on time way more often! Some people felt they did'nt have to work as hard as the clerks. Most of the co-workers were good,the hardest part about the job was management.I was filling & cleaning the wet rack & then breaking down the new load in the back cooler it was pretty big, you have to organize & rotate the old from the new! The best part of the day is the department looking nice and full and there was plenty of trained clerks keeping it full. So when you come in the next morning or evening it won't be a train wreck waiting for you when you come back!"
good,"to be honest, i enjoyed working at sprouts, but as time went by, i realized that the management was poor since i was treated very different compared to others."
good,"This is a very dynamic company with a great growth record.  The hardest part of the job is the ever changing retail environment, demands, expectations, needs and requests are constantly shifting for a variety of reasons.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that everyday brings with it new challenges often shifting multiple times throughout the day."
good,"There is a stark contrast between the in-store employees and the regional/corporate support staff. The disconnect can be summarized as trying to entice the horse without the carrot.  Hourly employees are led to believe that they can work hard and that the quality of their labor will be rewarded.  However the annual review structure limits pay increases due to time in position, and promotion opportunities are almost non-existent moving from marginal hourly positions to salaried ones that people can actually support themselves on, particularly when politically minded upper management continues to fill those positions with hires from outside the company."
good,"Normal retail job, keeps you busy. Not alot of time for personal life. Would like to see better pay for hard working employees."
good,The training there was horrible and managment was out of touch. Within the first two weeks they told me were going to fire me if I didn't move faster. They staff one courtesy clerk at a time for hours and you are expected to pick up the slack for everyone. Do not go into this particular job unless you can handle getting yelled at. You will feel extremely spread thin on moderately busy days and management was usually more focused on nitpicking than helping.
good,"I loved the learning experience at this company. I also love the sense of integral values while providing the utmost service to all customers and employees."
good,"Nothing special really. Long hours and underpaid staff. Overtime was needed in some departments but strictly forbidden by corporate management, which was a contradiction to their employee handbook. The local staff was great but we were all lied to on a daily basis about the nature of our jobs. Understaffed departments and over worked employees was the norm at Sprouts during my time there."
good,Management team is very unprofessional. Raises are close to nothing. There’s no room to grow since they hire outsiders as managers instead of promote within.
good,"If you want to work here you will not have a life.  Do not work here management really did not care about much of anything.  The head cashiers  are friendly enough, but only if you were a favorite."
good,When I worked at Sprouts the crew kept the store looking clean and well stocked. I have been in a couple times since leaving and could not believe how thrashed the entire store was both times. What happened?
good,It's another good job to work for if you are in school or just wanting to work part time. It gives you a lot of experience with customer service skills and understanding of dealing with all transactions.
good,"Sprouts is a quickly growing company, but at times that works against it: growing too quickly and cutting hours from its most profitable stores just to meet the projected sales they hope to reach. They care a lot about appearances but not about the employees, often saying there is nothing they can do if anyone were to call out at any given time on one of the busiest days of the week. They offer many varieties of products, yet lack lots of common stuff that customers regularly come in looking for, making sprouts a less than perfect alternative to more common chain stores. Their store upkeep and repair process is quite slow, and many things take weeks, or more often months, to get finally repaired or looked at. Many programs have failed because the managers haven't been able to implement them fast enough and thus none of the customers ever get to try the product and it dies before it ever starts. No one is motivated to try harder because there is so few people there to help, and thus everyone is saddled with a mountain of work to do and expectations to do more, for the little pay that we got. This particular store I worked at was one of the busiest in the company, apparently, and yet whenever people told me it was better than another chain store, I'd be shocked. Being on the inside and seeing how bad that store can get, I wouldn't recommend working there unless you like solving problems without hardly any recognition for it."
good,"The company and what it represents has the potential of being successful and supported by the customers. Unfortunately, any one with the role to make decisions or plans choose to do what they are told rather than taking the initiative to atleast try to fix a problem in their own. Even when it involves state of California laws in the work place."
good,"SFM is fast growing company."
good,"I enjoyed learning how to further my knowledge on fruits, vegetables, and melons. The team members I worked with were awesome in helping each other out and really making your day a more enjoyable time."
good,"The management for the Sprouts location in Baton Rouge is horrible. I understand that it is a new store but the store manager is the worse I have ever encountered. Half of the time she doesn’t know what goes on in her store until someone tells her or someone from out of town from another Sprouts location tells her what she is doing wrong. As of right now, they are firing people because of a “point system” however because she really does not care about her employees, she would rather fire them instead of approaching them when points are “accumulating “ to let them know where they stand. She has little remorse or understanding of her employees. Everybody is basically walking on eggshells at that job"
good,"I enjoyed my position and my coworkers. The health benefits were ok, not great. Pay is confusing. There isn’t a standard, unless favoritism is a standard. There isn’t any structure and a severe lack of communication starting with management. The “schedule” constantly changes and hours are always cut."
good,"Typical day at Sprouts is very faced paced, very demanding on the grocery side of the store where I work. I think that since the company is growing so fast, that there is some very big issues with management going on at store level and corporate level.  I hope that it will work itself out."
good,"I was head cashier. It seems like no matter what you do or how you do it, it seems wrong. They expect you to do your job properly and correctly but provide you  broken equipment to do it with. Then play the blame game. Favoritism upon management is almost disgusting. My co-workers and customer's we're the only good things."
good,"Day starts with a list of production that needs to be done. You start on it and its fine at first, then you are asked to take care of the chickens, the soups, clean random dishes, help customers with their meats and cheeses and make sandwiches. Only able to work on production while there aren't any customers. Then the next day, manager complains that your production wasn't finished and asks why. Then you are told that you need to manage your time better and to work faster. There is always something you are doing wrong, no matter how long you've been working there and how well you know your job, you're doing something wrong and won't be getting any kind of raise. And IF you do manage to get a raise, its $0.15. Really no reason to over work yourself, no incentive. Coworkers are usually fun and easy to talk to, but management is very poor."
good,"I've been with the company since our grand opening and love the discounts. Unfortunately, management decided to promote someone else from a different department who hasn't been with the company very long. Part of management are not qualified for the position and don't do their role properly. Pay was very low compared to other companies and benefits offered were bare minimum. Overall, I did enjoy working with some of my co-workers who work hard and have a positive attitude."
good,"The company's is great to work for how ever my store was a pain, under staffed in many departments. Having courtesy clerks work other departments, having lists of thing they are required to do on top of their regular duties. Management is very self centered, not helpful and at times rude to customers."
good,this is just a grocery business. Better than kroger worse than whole foods. Its a relaxed environment here. There is great food and options here if you care about this. Customers appreciate the alternatives that Sprouts offers.
good,"Working with the customer was a joy.  Management levels were never on the floor dealing with customer needs unless paged."
good,"Sprouts has a lot of managers with little expiriance, there is no training, sink or swim, figure it out on your own. Definitely need to be in the click with the right people . Don’t speak your mind , just do what your told."
good,"I have worked with the company for about 2 years and my experience between one store and another are wholly different. One of the main points of contention with this company, regardless of which location, is the lack of hours given. They allot the hours based off of how much the store makes- you can start with 4/5 days and just like that, you're working 2/3. Based off of the sentiments of my coworker that have worked here longer, there is a growing resentment over the fast, and sometimes redundant changes in the workplace. Promotions to coroporate jobs seem difficult to attain, as many are brought in from outside of the company. My prior store was much more clean, professional, and fun. This current one can be very low energy, employees are crude to one another, and there are a few things left to be desired with management. All in all, it's a decent company, but make sure you're aware of the fact that needing a second job is a probability, and that you get good vibes from the store you apply at- otherwise it'll be a tough run!"
good,When I began i really liked my job and I was getting good hours but once management switched my hours are unpredictable and I am not making enough to pay my bills.
good,"Sprouts is a fine place to work part time or get a first job, but in the long run it is not worth it, because the higher up you are the more pressure their is from the less-than-understanding management, where perfection is often the expectation without regard for extenuating circumstances. This created an always-looking-over-your-shoulder atmosphere where there is little comfort or freedom to simply do your job."
good,"I love the people I work with and the clients but the pay is horrible, advancement takes forever. Other health food stores take better care of their employees."
good,"Satisfied my needs at the time; gave me an easy, stress free way of making some money in between school quarters. Appeared that coworkers were able to move up the company and receive raises, although I was not there long enough to receive one personally."
good,"The position of courtesy clerk is an excellent job for young people looking to gain experience, as the hours are flexible and tend to range from only 5 to 15 per week. The functions of the job are also very simple and easy to master. These aspects are also what make the job challenging for people later in their careers, however, as they limit opportunities for growth. Employee reviews are conducted once per year at Sprouts but typically don't result very large pay increases even with highly positive reviews. Getting more hours can also be a challenge, as the company tends to over-staff stores with  employees. The work culture (management in particular) has always been friendly and helpful, though, which is a big pro, especially for those looking for a relaxed, positive work environment."
good,It can be a fun place to work but it is a fast paced environment. Management can be derogatory towards workers. Advancement happens through the buddy system not based on performance.
good,"dishonest hiring practices, felt like they would literally say anything to get you in the door. Promised 4/10s with OT options, and ended up being 5/15s. Managers, supervisors, and leads would just tell you to suck it up everyone else is doing it, or attempt to divert the issue with some catch phrase (Grit)  or sympathy story. Worked with the supervisors and managers multiple times to attempt to get a reasonable schedule as the work is very physically demanding. Each time they said next week they'll fix or change it or give me another catch phrase and sympathy story."
good,Standing on your feet all day and not allowed to move around during slow periods. I don't think that the scheduling was very smart considering we would have multiple people on the floor at a time but only a few of s would be busy.
good,"it was a very slow paced job, it was not as interesting as it seems and its a good way to have as a first job especially if youre new to working, great."
good,"My main focus was on my hours. I kept asking for Sundays off so I could go to church and have some family time because it is the only day they can come, but my requests still would not come to light. Eventually, I got tired of it."
good,"I helped open a store in Atlanta, and it seemed to all be off to a great start. I had the role of Dairy Manager, and took pride in my department. But I just didn't end up getting the support I felt necessary, and the experience wasn't the best"
good,"Sunflower was sold to Sprouts.  I worked at Sprouts for only a few months.  In my short time at Sprouts, top management was in transition.  CEO was replaced shortly after I left."
good,"A typical day at Sprouts consists of hurrying around the store, catering to the needs of the customers while completing the tasks given to your specific position, for a courtesy clerk, running store sweeps, bringing in the carts, and bagging people's items at check out. Here, I've learned customer service skills. The management is not the worst, but not necessarily the best I've encountered. The hardest part of this job is dealing with upset customers in a positive manner. The most enjoyable part is the sense of community they have in the store."
good,"Overall if your between jobs, in college or high school, or have little work experience its alright. hard to make any real money staying at the bottom so if you want to make this a career then you have to move up which can be difficult."
good,"They advertise flexible hours but if you try to get your hours changed they say that's not something you can do. That you have to have full availability, despite flexibility being one of the things they promised! Also, if they say you are due a raise or that you are getting a promotion get it in writing because that's probably a lie."
good,I’ve worked here for quite awhile and make good money but I am capped out. Constantly overlooked for higher positions. They like to hire external to start pay lower
good,"A typical day would to get your station ready  , very fast paced , management is average , workplace culture is average . the hardest part of the job is working around heat . Customer relations is the most enjoyable part of the job ."
good,"This was a job in Edmond, Oklahoma. the job was ok.. This was a fast paced job, and you stayed busy all the time. This involved a lot of customer service,"
good,"The company used to be privately owned.  When they went public everything slowly started changing.  My strong opinion is that they do not value committed, hard working, honest, dependable employees.  I have always been sold out for Sprouts.  Truly happy to work there, always showed up for my scheduled times, committed to sharing all that Sprouts had to offer and always going above and beyond.  I would also go in when called in to fill a shift. And I've worked there for over 6 years.  In this past year, I am treated as a new person right off the street.  My day shifts that I was hired for and had worked for over 5 years, are now no more.  We now have a computer doing our scheduling and it shows no seniority.  It can be changed by management, as it is for a few of the workers. Shorter shifts, only get 5 1/2 hour shifts now and only about 12 - 20 hours weekly.  We used to get 6 1/2 - 8 hours shifts, with between 24 to 32 hours weekly.  Several of us have been concerned as we cannot live on this amount."
good,I learned a lot at Sprouts Farmers Market.  I had flexibility at Sprouts Farmers Market.  My office and location was nice at Sprouts Farmers Market.  Thank you.
good,"The managers expect too much from a single person in a seven hour shift. They will regularly require you to do extra tasks on top of your expected daily duties, that there is barely enough time to finish as it is."
good,"I Prefer it to places like king soopers or safeway, No union is a big problem however and my seniority dosnt get me much. I never really felt stressed or overwhelmed, the downside being I was never really challenged to learn new skills."
good,The company itself is amazing to work for.  Advancement is possible if you are willing to train in all areas. Some of the management personnel really don't care how things are ran.  Bringing them examples of areas that need improvement does nothing.
good,"Fun, high paced work environment. No guarantee of 40 hours per week. Very poor benefits and pay. A good starter job, but i would definetly not recommend it for career minded individuals."
good,They started out with positive attitudes and plenty of hours. I was told that I would be cross trained so that I could maintain my  40 hours a week. That has not happened. I have been getting scheduled for 15 - 33 hours a week more consistently about 20 hours. I think if a person is in the right position (management) that it is probably a great place to work. In the role of clerk it has not been favorable.
good,Poor management Over work you but not willing to pay its so messy and unprofessional with no direction or room to grow within the company no benefits until after a year
good,job life at sprouts is rewarding to the fact that the environment is positive and the community is nice. the core standards that the company sets up are lacking discipline and follow through effort.
good,"Sprouts is a really good place to start working as a teen because it will teach you a lot about the work force, customer service, and how to be a good employee. The management is not the best but the culture is good which makes it the best part of the job."
good,"Was a good place to work.  New management came in an wanted to go in a different direction, wanted  to save money with payroll. The company is growing to fast in four years we had six Store managers."
good,"Typical day included lots of customers in and out. You must memorize codes for produce and move customers through your line quickly. Management is lacking, they play favorites and if youre not on that list you get no hours and talked down to. Employees are fantastic though."
good,"Depending on where I worked with Sprouts, I either enjoyed my job or flat out hated it. I have had wonderful managers and terrible managers. Most of the experience working here depending on the management. At each store I worked at, my co-workers were amazing. And for the most part, the people who shopped there were great. I was able to have conversations with them and feel like an actual person rather than an employee."
good,"Most of the coworkers were friendly and helpful, but the schedule was chaotic and sometimes difficult to predict. Schedules varied every week with everyone being part-time."
good,The people you worked with were awesome but we all seemed to agree that the management was terrible. The company didn't listen to the workers stating the management wasn't fair.
good,"Working at Sporuts was nice but at times management would make it stressful. There were definitely communication problems between workers and managers which would cause problems throughout the week. Other than that, working there was pretty nice."
good,"You have to kind of force yourself to like what you're doing here. But the majority of the time, working here is not worth it. I've seen managers and employees get into fights while the customer is there. Managers treating the employees like mangy stray dogs and using them for their own personal, desperate gain. Working at Sprouts USED to have fun working potential, but now it's literally every man for himself. I think I speak for everybody who has worked there for years or had just recently started."
good,Its a normal work day. just remember to clock in and clock out at the right time. the pers are awesome. corporate north region sucks at helping our management team.
good,A normal day for myself would consist of prepping the sandwich bar area. That means that I would fully stock my station with condiments and anything else needed to make a great sandwich. I would also ensure that I had back up prep of everything.
good,The Liberty location was a new location that was filled with excellent employees that suffered at the hand of inexperienced supervisors and a brand new store that lacked what most other Sprout's provided.
good,I love the people who enter my store. Enjoy working with my co workers that keep it fun when things get tough on the job. Management is a issue which needs to be fixed.
good,"Other CoWorkers were great to work with."
good,Sprouts flooding geographical area with stores within 10+ miles of each other. Lack of hours and quality personnel for the various departments. The company hires some extreme untalented employees. Sprouts doesn't test for any departmental positions. This explains the crappiness. The Sprouts has a great concept and customer base to compete with neighboring stores within the area. You just have to be a GREAT BACKSIDE KISSER to be promoted.
good,"My coworkers are amazing! We are a family here at Sprouts. A typical day at work for myself is very busy. In the mornings I am the bookkeeper and doing office work. Once I am done for the day then I can go help other departments throughout the store, I have helped cashier, bulk, deli, bakery, and grocery departments. Management needs to better communicate and instruct employees when or if they make an error. It is a pretty laid back environment so there isn't a difficult part of the job. Most enjoyable would be my coworkers and our proficiency in customer service."
good,"I enjoyed my year working as a sales associate with Sprouts. I learned a lot about healthy living and was introduced to a world of new foods that I would not have otherwise discovered. This job came to me at a very desperate, desolate time in my life. I will never forget the experience or those I worked with."
good,"The other staff were pleasant and productive, however management lacked good quality leadership skills.I was promoted, however was not given the tools to do my job the my fullest ability. I had to ""learn"" many of the tasks without any guidlines."
good,"Standing at a register, helping customers, doesn't get much easier. Once people get to know you and come to you to check out every week, you feel good. Sprouts is nice because there can be awesome customers that will brighten your day. not all of them but a good bit are pretty awesome. If you enjoy talking to strangers for short periods of times while working then this job is a breeze."
good,I enjoyed it in the beginning but later on it started to become a hassle to come into work and deal with rude people and coworkers that didn't really get anything done. But over all I did enjoy the productive personalities. great place but wasn't for me.
good,"Sprouts is a good place to work, everyone is friendly and helpful. The only downside to sprouts was management, their communication with employees was poor. This may have been improved upon since i was there."
good,Sprouts pays low wages. My store was new and the management was new as well. No guaranteed hours. Felt unheard. But my coworkers were generally nice and fun to work with. I still shop there sometimes for the produce and to see the people.
good,No chance of advancement unless you personally know a manager. Unfair treatment of employees and constant reminder of how expendable you are. Managers are pampered while clerks are treated poorly.
good,I really enjoyed working at Sunflower (Sprouts) until they merge into Sprouts. A typical day would be working with customers to find there product and checking them out. I also would clear the carts out of the  parking lot. When the merge happen with Sunflower and Sprouts most management change. The change was hard cause the new management was not as nice or willing to work with the employees. It was all or nothing. I loved my co-workers. They were a bunch of great people. The hardest part was dealing with a mananger that did not like me. But i enjoyed every other part of my job.
good,Loved working here. Was very easy but fast pace job. Always had something to do. But Management was so unprofessional and everyone knew everyone's business.
good,"An ultimately terrible company to work for. Management made consistent decisions that seemed incompetent and hasty, cutting hours across the board when the store was getting busier and busier. Co-workers are the only real positive of this job, from my experience. The pay is mediocre and your chances of advancing are not as high as you're led to believe; hard work is seldom noticed and appreciated. "
good,"Their priority is sales not employees.  With 20+ years of nutritional supplement knowledge, and as much supervisory experience I'm the most competent employee in their vitamin department but my hours have been constantly cut back in favor of employees that have little to no experience in supplements, sales, or supervision.  The upper management lack coherent management skills, communication and planning and were unwilling to listen to recommendations.  I was promised an assistant manager position in a new store but when I got passed over for that in favor of someone else with less knowledge and experience the department manager hid from me and relegated me to night shift where he didn't have to interact with me.  Because of my extensive knowledge they would prefer to keep me at the bottom as merely a sales person but I can't afford to live on the amount of pay they're insulting me with. I've been watching the store I worked in implode on itself and its time to get out before things completely fall apart."
good,"The store is fun to be in. Great people all around. However, the management was lazy and usually placed you in different departments."
good,I enjoyed working and going to work everyday. The only issue was it was too far of a drive for me and I didnt have my own car at the moment. so I had to depend on others to take me to work and pick me. They didnt take to kindly of me being pregnant. But when I applied for them at first i had no idea I was pregnant until two months after being hired.
good,"A typical workday always begins with great customer service, each day can go differently according to company promotions and needs of store conditions. We as management are always relaying information and updates from our corporate offices which need to be met, and followed up by us. Not necessarily the hardest part about the job but more challenging I would say is running an efficient department merchandising, calling multiple vendors, researching out of stocks and why, being able to answer to big numbers, high inventory, low sales, and reminding ourselves we are in the service industry and customer service is still our number goal. The most enjoyable part is researching new products. This day and age with new diets and a health conscious society theres new products on the market everyday, being able to sample, and push these new items and share my experience and research with others is the most fulfilling."
good,This company is in process of growth in Texas with lots of kinks at corporate level to work out. Turnover is high and management is held down. Short staffed on a daily basis with gaps in shift change. No time to manage staff due to filling in other lacking areas. All this created an hostile work environment.
good,"Cashiering, wiping down registers frequently for sanitation, keeping floors clean, making intercom announcements, writing return slips. Remembering extensive produce codes and to reprint error slips."
good,This will job will definitely keep you busy always something going on and no time to slow down. I your looking for a fast paced job and wanting to get a work out come here.
good,"I love being,a cashier , but this job ... they hire you as a full time employee and they give you like 18-26 hrs a week. I tried getting a second part time job and managment said they wouldn't work with me so basically I hit a dead end. Since its a customers always get what they want kind of store we have to constantly call managment for discounts, price reductions, and returns/refunds... but they never seem to be around, they keep you and the customer waiting 5+mins."
good,the management is the worse thing about the job we are under staffed and they are doing absolutely nothing to better the work environment
good,"I'd go in and do a sweep. Then i'd bag for a bit, then go out and collect some carts. Check the aisles for anything that needed to be straightened. Pretty Basic, pretty easy."
good,Had to pick up slack from other employees every time i walked in. I didn't complain much but i had a good laugh listening to all the other employees complaining.
good,fun environment however unorganized management and promotion opportunities.
good,"Everyday I accomplish the same goals of making the meals, and assisting customers with slicing of meats and cheeses as well as making sandwiches. Everyone is usually in a good mood and we joke around in the kitchen all day but are still able to work at a fast pace and complete the job in a timely manner. I've learned better customer service skills and how to plan and execute accordingly. "
good,Just like any grocery store it was a simple place to work and succeed.  I had my own disagreements with management in regards to transferring departments and doing what I wanted to do but other than that it was ok.
good,It was difficult and stressful but for my first real job I learned a lot through it. I would bag groceries and pull carts in grueling temperatures. It was unenjoyable for sure but I had nice benefits
good,"Sprouts Farmers Msrket is great at advancing promising employees, if you manage to stick it through inconsistant hours. As a grocery store, Sprout's labor is driven by sales/profit. Whe sales are up your department will be given more hours, during the slower season hours are cut. It is difficult to stay at a job with an inconsistant schedule, and ever changing hours. Consequently, Sprouts has some of the highest turnover rates in Grocery. For those who can make it work however, it can be worth it. "
good,"I was hired at a brand new store in Arizona. Management and everybody was very helpful at that store. Then I transferred Store in California. And didn’t feel the same that I did when I was at a new store, management was different I didn’t have enough hours. And I got a call from Costco for seasonal, so I quit sprouts farmers market to work for Costco."
good,"My position entailed working at the register with customers, checking out their purchases and addressing customer questions and concerns. This job involved a lot of standing around, and the workplace culture is not very developed, but the company itself has some interesting aspects like charitable projects and reward programs for the employees. Management was good but nothing special."
good,I started work early and was usually home around noon.  The whole afternoon was open so having another job or going to school would have been no problem.
good,"In my experience working at sprouts there was always so much drama and I tried to stay out of it but eventually you just decide its not worth it and look for something else, the pay is amazing though, 15 bucks an hour and more if you have experience."
good,"I enjoyed working for Sprouts as long as I did, but I will never go back. The company has an issue with governing power and control, and relinquishes that power to store managers."
good,The employees are really great but the store is very mismanaged. They have trouble getting people to stay but all in all its a pretty good place to work.
good,I had one cool manager and the rest were horrible. I barely likes my coworkers. The position i worked was only good because I got 40 hour weeks other than that they don’t care about their employees because they aren’t union.
good,Sprouts is a good Job to work at... They should take more time out to train their employees... very flexible with hours. Some stores are better then others to work at
good,"Yes there is opportunity for advancement, especially since Sprouts is quickly expanding across the country. But it still feels like a dead end job. At least you get a 15% discount on most products in store."
good,"Sprouts was initially a good job, that was until the state of the back room became aware to me. The break room was the size of a closet and fairly filthy, there are a myriad of issues but I feel it's good to understand where one would rather not work."
good,"I had worked for Sprout's for nearly 6 years. Overall the experience gave me some great experience. I met and worked with a lot of awesome people, both in management and clerk positions. However, the overall balance and structure of the company has seen better days."
good,"There's not much else to say. The management was great just inconsistent hours when im supposed to be full time.                                            "
good,Alot of nice employees and customers alot of contests a chance to taste new products discounts available location is easy to get to.Regional trainers are very helpful
good,"There isn't any room for improvement, you need to kiss major butt to get hours, too much favoritism, never enough help and hour cuts. Most of the managers are nice and are understanding."
good,Overall it's a basic job I gotten crossed train to do lots of different departments. Working with my coworkers was very fun. It is a okay work environment.
good,working at sprouts I feel like the management and the lower employees have a certain clique that they stick to and those people have first shot at moving up. i don't think that's fair and if i can't move up then i can't move forward. so while it may be a place where other's can be content I need somewhere I can achieve more.
good,It just not what I thought it be ... There's lack of communication with workers .. I love the customers. At times there not fair with there employees.
good,"Its just fast paced. I learned how to speak to people, and management is ok. Working at sprouts is fun. I can't really think of anything hard at work. But I do enjoy working"
good,"If you are interested in running a department I advise getting hired into it, because you will start with more.  If you want to decide to promote from withing you just have to show your hard work and make sure that the company knows you want to promote they will help support you.  However you will not start as much as if you got hired off the street."
good,My experience working at Sprouts was a good one met a lot of good people and learned some new things. Management was ok overall good place to work. They just need to have better compensation so they can keep there employees.
good,"Depending on location this company will keep you both ya and on your toes. Lots of customer service opportunities, gives you the chance to learn and meet new people everyday"
good,Sprouts is a very productive workplace and fast paced . The atmosphere is nice for the most part and employees have a good time. I like the managers at sprouts.
good,"Sprouts was a fine place to work but I did not see a future there."
good,A typical day is pretty easy depending on the department you're in. expectations can be a little demanding with how many hours the departments are given. The employees are what makes this a fun environment to work in.
good,"I highly enjoyed my time with Sprouts Farmers Market. In my position, I was able to help employees better themselves for the next level of their position. There were many things that could have been avoided if only the regional team had the support to be more involved at store level. There are tons of advancement opportunities by simply showing up on time and completing work at hand. If given the opportunity again in the future, I would be a administrative coordinator again for this company."
good,"Pay is average, work is typical deli job requirement (food prep, slice deli meats and cheeses). I found that my department was often understaffed. The work is generally fast paced and weekends are hectic but the time goes by fast."
good,"The company should take better care of employees,  Needs to hire management that has more experience in leadership ,Hours are scarce even during season."
good,"The work is easy and the customers are great to talk to. The store is kept spotless and have high standards when it comes to display. The managers are all kind and helpful, but are very lenient (which may be a benefit for some people). I do enjoy the general work environment, but the scheduling alone makes me despise working at Sprouts. The shifts are sporadic and even if you are part time they will have you come in 6 or 7 days a week, giving you 4 to 7 hour shifts so you do not get a lunch break. They also give the maximum hours necessary for you to work like a slave but get no benefits. Sprouts should practice better scheduling, creating a consistent schedule (with 8 hour shifts so everyone can have a lunch break) to keep their employees stable and prepared to work."
good,"Great concept, stores are great private label excellent. Corporate way out of touch with the store level. You have a better chance of advancement if you know the right people."
good,"It was fun to be here, honestly. Only reason why I got in is because my sister told my managers to hire me as well as a reference. Most days at work aren't so busy but the weekends (especially Saturday) was slammed with people. When it was slammed, you better be ready to wait a little bit as the lines can be lengthy."
good,Loved the atmosphere and working with people. Very busy store located in the heart of North Park. Too many people call out though and make it more stressful for others. All in all its an ok place to work at.
good,"with any company growth can either hurt or harm. When I began Sprouts it was a new to Texas and fairly new as a company. It was also owned by a group of experienced, hands on people who had seen their own business develop and grow. Throughout the years it grew more successful and more and more stores opened. Personally I felt with more stores the less unique we became and our other stores took business away from each other."
good,"I've been working at a Sprouts location in Roswell for over two years."
good,"lots to do,"
good,"About what you would expect of a retail job at a grocery store, nothing of note. However management was swapped around constantly, and hours were very inconsistent at my location."
good,It was a really fun place to work at. Fast paced and customers were really nice. Management just never gives credit when due. Management will not support you or help you in any way when you ask form help. That is my experience at San Ramon location
good,they work you hard at spouts. they are always cutting hours and you have to work hard to get more than 30 hours. they also pay really low than any where else. they will cheat you out of a pay rise too.
good,"I really did enjoy working for Sprouts, they have many issues that companies who go public deal with and the compensation for anyone below manager level is poor but the experience is very valuable. Many of my colleagues were interesting, fun, and hard working. I grew frustrated with my pay rate, not getting my schedule until the last minute, poor upper management, and the lack of room to grow. Other than those issues it was a fast-paced quick learning environment, my favorite part of the job was getting to know the products intimately and being able to truly help customers find what they need."
good,"Sprouts is great for customers, but not so much for its' employees. There are some good store managers and trainers, but the higher-ups obviously care more about the shareholders and less about those who are providing the customer service.. The store managers are constantly told to cut back labor hours; causing stress and lower morale for the employees. The department managers are expected to accomplish more with an ever-shrinking labor budget and subsequent part-time staff turnover. Also, the HR department seems to be understaffed and lots of problems with payroll errors. There need be more investment in better technologies and software that will simplify our jobs. It could be a better place to work if the guys at the top of the chain decided to reinvest some of the wealth. Quit being so cheap with labor and resources. We would be able to sell more and focus more on giving excellent service if we weren't stretched so thin."
good,"Very relaxed and flexible managers allowed all the employees to be very personable, energized, and always come in to work with a smile and ready to help the customers to the best of our abilities."
good,"My time at sprouts gave me lots of experience in a variety of departments. The employees are great but there is poor management. People get promoted based on politics, those who work hard are under appreciated."
good,good place lack of advancement and little income growth learned a lot about how management should be ran and also how important work life balance is and is needed.
good,"Through my days at sprouts farmers market i had learned a lot of things. I started there as a courtesy clerk, and excelled. From there i moved on into grocery, and when that became more populated with employees, i got a chance to try my hand at produce. All were relatively easy, i got a grasp on how things were done daily rather quickly. i would say the hardest part of the job was the extra work or time i had to put in (approximately 30min-1hr) every other day without compensation. and the best part of the job was the friendships and work environment."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job are the customers.  Workplace culture can be very stressful when it doesn't have to be.  I would like to advance in the business but I have not really been given the tools to do so.
good,"When coming on to your shift, you never know what is in-store for you.  There is always something to do at work.  Many different departments to take care of and to make sure is running smoothly.  I do enjoy working with the associates at my store.  That is the best part of managing the store."
good,"Sprouts overall is a good place to work. They are flexible with your schooling. But mostly the bad is the people. Coworkers, management, and customers. But that's kind of the case everywhere."
good,"A typical day usually would start at 3 or 4am. It included baking and prepping fresh product to go to the floor and removing expired product that would then get donated to local food banks."
good,A typical day at work would be long lines and nonstop customers. There was never downtime at Sprouts. Constant restocking and ringing out customers. The hardest part of the job was the codes to type into the computer. Every vegetable and fruit or singled items had its own code. The most enjoyable part was how laid back the company was.
good,"The typical day at work is pretty standard day to day stuff. Come in, do whatever was assigned to you for the day and then leave. Assisting customers throughout the day. I've learned a lot while there. How to take inventory of stock, ordering of stock, cashiering, and other basic retail skills. Management is probably Sprouts's weakest part. They don't seem to care about any employees, sans a select few. Any grievances seem to be overlooked until an employee or customer gets injured, or something happens that would cost the company a lot of money. On the other hand, the customers are kind and the non-management employees are attentive and friendly. The most difficult part of the job would probably be dealing with the terrible hours and management, and the most enjoyable being the customer interactions and employee interactions."
good,Ok not the best pay and lots of favoritism hours get cut if ou are not promised full time you can get 10 hours a week at times also if you have a issue it never gets resolved
good,"I work in the deli.  It is a fast paced environment.  You have many responsibilities, from cooking chicken, to cutting cheese's and deli meats,  to making sandwiches, checking temps, to making party platters , to helping customers in every capacity. "
good,"When hired they tell you that you can move up in the company and in the 9 1/2 months I worked there they never once moved anybody up, they instead just hired people to fill higher positions. Not giving employees a chance to move up at all"
good,"Sprouts started strong and grew quickly. Customers were attracted by a good balance of price and quality, but more importantly, they were attracted by the atmosphere. Friendly employees and a ""farmers market"" aesthetic gave off a feeling of warmth and welcome. When I started at Sprouts, it was a nice place where people would come not just for groceries, but for a positive experience."
good,"It is a nice place to work when hard working people are well compensated. Some department managers are not good to work with because they don't treat their staff right, their position goes to their head but there are good department managers too. With regards to the store managers, there are some of them I don't know why they became a store manager because they are lazy, don't know anything, don't apply or practice whatever they learn in training so they can help in the store if needed in whatever department. They don't want to work and help because their mentality is that they are one of the store managers."
good,"Hours kept diminishing and proved too unreliable to stick around. Not the greatest management, pretty apathetic towards a lot of issues, personal or other employees."
good,"Helping customers find products and answered questions, took quizzes about different foods and nutrition and trained new cashiers."
good,Some of the managers that the company employed were discriminatory against disabilities and violate the code of conduct and ethics other than that good people work here
good,"Management at Sprouts is very unstable and the turnover rate was abnormally high during my time there. They were always cutting budget and labor so the store was constantly understaffed, often leaving 1-2 employees to do the work of 4+. Sprouts attracts unique workers and customers and the people I met there are the reason I was there for so long. There was never a dull moment between coworkers and the interesting customer base we dealt with daily. Overall, Sprouts was an OK job, but the continual changes in management and policy was unreasonable."
good,"I like the job, but the lower ranks have called out more then a few times, don't see too much devotion outside of the Meat Manager, Assistant Manager, and Head Clerks."
good,Pay is decent work life balance no so great. Store management can differ store to store. Under staffed is very common in Georgia for sprouts.
good,Overall I would say it is just okay.the pay is not bad you do get benefits if you work over 32 hours I think you get benefits after 6 months.Most of the customers are great.however the management could definitely be improved.communication is poor.the transfer system is not good.i wanted to transfer to a new store that was opening and the manager of that store said she would call me I had put in my transfer paper a month before and went their job fair.I think that the store I was at just wanted to keep me because they wanted to cover vacations because they refuse to hire anybody else!anyway while working here. I was harassed when I worked in the bakery area. The bakery manager yelled at me and talked down to me. I did report it to the ethics hotline.nothing was done to her and she got promoted to a third manager! How does that happen???since being promoted she has been better.i did forgive her.anyway they aren't up front with you.they are deceptive which is sad considering that the company stands for integrity.there is so much gossip here sometimes it feels like a soap opera.I like what I do in the deli except closing.I like my actual duties and most of the employees are nice.
good,"Since I have worked there, the whole management team has been moved around, so it may be different. However when I had been employed there, managers were difficult to work with and had even participated in illegal activities such as clocking out employees who were still working, moving shifts around without the consent or knowledge of the employees. If it wasn't for the fact they refused to work with my school schedule or even budge about the schedule when I picked up a second job, I may still have worked there. The other employees were great people and a lot of fun and easy to work with. I never had an issue with anyone other than the scheduling manager."
good,I got this job after I graduated high school and worked as a bagger. I got along with my coworkers very well. The problem is I never felt comfortable talking to management unless I had no choice. The hardest part about this job though is dealing with a lot of angry hungry people.
good,"Work independently on stocking and rotating all produce products. Working in most of the departments, I've learned a lot about the store's products and what it offers to it's customers and employees. Everyone is extremely friendly including our stores management staff who make you feel appreciated and that everyone is working hard together as a team not as an individual."
good,Most enjoyable part of my day was being able to become acquainted with my repeat customers and asking them about their day
good,"I worked for Sunflower Farmers Market when Sprouts acquired the company. The management was already really bad at the store that I worked at and pay was already really low among all employees. But during the transition, I lost employees and it was hard to keep any in the store with such low pay and hard work with lots of hours. We commonly ran into problems with ordering products and being forced to receive and sell new product when we did not have room or the sales to really even need any of it. "
good,"On a regular day of work I was required to prepare, stock, clean, and serve customers. My co-workers were friendly and the enviorment was very upbeat but to me there was a lack of credibility."
good,"The work was easy, being that in the Vitamin Dept. you really couldn't leave. Sometimes you get many customers that need help and it's only you by yourself. It helps a lot to know your supplements, some people get offended if you don't (imagine going to GNC or vitamin shoppe and the clerk cannot answer your supplement questions). Coworkers are helpful and great. Management can be sloppy. You get an order from one and a different one from the other. Good Luck"
good,"Sprouts is a great company to work for, but the management is lacking. The other employees are great to work with, it just needs to be managed better."
good,"A typical day at work was typical. As a host I was positioned at the front of the restaurant welcoming guests and showing them their seats. Planning a seating chart got challenging at times, especially during the holidays or special events. Management was hard to get in touch with. It was hard to either find a manager or talk to them about anything. Co-workers were fun and made the job enjoyable. They may not always be there but they made the most of their time and made the working place fun. The most enjoyable part was my co-workers. Their unique personalities made working there fun and made me look forward to coming to work everyday. The hardest part was trying to make a living while still in school."
good,"Good place to work, but very much micro managed to death, pay is average for a retail job.  Good discounts and everyone is friendly, including the managers even if they are extremely strict."
good,"Fun place to work if you are customer service-oriented, and love building relationships with ""regulars."" Patience is a virtue at this Company- both with customers, and room for advancement. I loved my job, personally, but I knew I was going to be stationary for a long time, even though I got promoted from Cashier to Head Cashier/Management within 3 months. As a cashier, you had better be ready to memorize over 600 PLU codes and product location/knowledge, and have a SUPERIOR Scan Rate! Otherwise, you'll be ""Weeded Out..."" Meaning, cutting hours in the hopes you'll quit."
good,"Not fun having management on your back all the time. Coworkers on the other hand are amazing. No opportunity to advance, only those who are managers pets and those who always go out of their way to buy the managers food and drinks get promoted. Happened at least 5 times while working there."
good,Sprouts was an easy job close to my house.  It was really convenient so I didn't have to travel far. The co-workers were nice and loved to help each other.  There was only one rude manager who was also mean to customers. Overall Sprouts was a good job.  The only bad thing was that they cut my hours and gave them to someone else.
good,"attend and assist to customers, and there final needs and purches. returns, complaints, cash handling, some good people to work with. in a very fun and fast paced environment, with lots to learn."
good,"I enjoyed this job as my first, I learned a lot and made new skills."
good,"the company had no growth to advance in position wise. lacked management. great co workers, had experience in every department meat department, deli, vitamins, grocery and produce"
good,Sprouts is a great company that offers excellent benefits.
good,"I learned everything i know from here. It took a while to get into any training, but there are quality workers to help teach along the way. Lots of work to keep busy and great benefits."
good,"After working for many grocery stores, Sprouts is one of the worst offenders of keeping useless employees. Countless times I was stuck pulling dates from other departments that the managers had ignored, usually each day i pulled dates i would come up with around $5,000 worth of product that had expired. How this company continues to make money is beyond me. The company is also becoming closer and closer to being a union company without the benefits of having a union."
good,It was ok company to work for decent management and the work wasn’t to overwhelming. The reason I left was got another job with better pay. They would ask for people to work overtime but when it came time for them to pay they would want the people with overtime to take  longer breaks so they would hit overtime. Which is pretty messed up to do to your employees.
good,"Management was never present while I was there because they were trying to implement better management and was looking for a replacement.  A typical day included walking through the doors, and checking-in for the day.  I would talk to who was in charge and see what they needed.  This usually entailed putting produce up and changing around the sales tables.  The hardest part was keeping the backroom clean because we always had shipments coming in and the people in charge were a little messy and not organizing it the way they should have been."
good,It'a tough business.  Grocery retail is.  But I love what this company stands for.  Healthy eating for less.  This company allows you to reach out into the community and teach the benefits of eating healthy.  A different type of grocery store that allows the consumer who has special eating habits to find what they need.
good,Good job but company can use a few lessons in people management. Quite often do the team members at store level get forgotten. Great medical benefits.
good,Awesome place to work just go apply and take a chance a lot better than most grocery chains also you can move up in the company if your willing to work
good,"Career path online units are great. However, they say to get management positions you need to have held the position before. So, take that training elsewhere is what I guess they want to help you do..."
good,Customer services and getting to talk with the customer. Making food is the enjoyable part of the day. Doing the dishes is not so enjoyable.  Management treats you fairly and is friendly.
good,"I personally don't have anything bad to say about it other than the fact they have a hierarchal system in place for promoting their employees, meaning it's not what you know, but who you know."
good,Had a lot of opportunities to expand my customer service skill set while working for this employer. Management took every opportunity to give teaching experiences. Awesome.
good,"Would not work with my schedule, and I was pretty flexible."
good,"Overall Sprouts is an ""ok"" place to work.  I enjoy my co-workers and interacting with most of the customers.  Management has a lot to be desired.  You have lots of support with learning and training.  The store is often lacking enough staff."
good,Sprouts Market attempts to provide a different shopping experience for consumers in the area of groceries and other consumer goods. Overall work environment is positive
good,Great place to work. Good benefits. Great employee discounts. I would definitely go back to work there! The only thing that was hard for me is that 32 hours is considered full time and I needed more hours than that or I would still be working there!
good,"I worked at the deli, and every moment was filled with duties I couldn’t finish with the certain amount of time.  Some duties couldn’t be completed.  I do not like that feeling.  "
good,"There are several reasons why I still work at Sprouts, the two main one's are "
good,"Had a decent time while I was there. Helped with my people skills."
good,Overall everything therw needs to ne organize better and shifts need to be a foucs manger needs to get it together and be on top of everything. I don't like being tbe only one who picks up the slack and works hars while everyone is talking and hanging out or on brakes.
good,"Sprouts use to be a great place to work, once they went public it all changed. Mainly it comes down to labor and lack there of, also new employees are given no real incentive to stay."
good,Manangement is not transparent. HR does not take situations serious when managment threatens the life of employees. Overall majority of staff is down to earth people.
good,"I would say that working at Sprouts, there are quiet days, but Wednesdays and Sunday’s are the most hectic. This is just for experience and they are understanding for your own goals"
good,I learned a lot about customer service and handling money. The pay was low and there is not a lot of room for advancement or raises. There is a lot of micro-management.
good,the job is very stressful and often times management has unrealistic expectation but the pay is very reasonable and i enjoy most of my co workers. i recommend working here.
good,"Overall not a bad place to work, they can have unrealistic expectations at times, but that is most retail jobs. i would recommend giving them a shot if you need some work."
good,"I worked at sprouts for 2 1/2 years and had good times and bad. The pay was OK, better than grocery outlet, but was not competitive with other big grocery chains. We got a raise once a year at our preformance reviews and the cap on the annual raise is $0.35/hr, but even that wasn't guaranteed. Hours also, were not guaranteed for even full-time employees. As a full-time employee during a big busget cut one quarter, i was cut down to 2 days one week. It was so bad people were losing their benefits. However, i had a great team and loved the people i worked with. My immediate manager did her best to take care of her employees, dispite pressure from corporate."
good,"Great company, better for the younger folks. There is a great deal of confusion surrounding communication within this store. I'm sure it will get worked out as there has been a lot of Staff turnover as some older team members went to other locations and new people were brought on."
good,the jobs at sprouts are painfully easy and it would be a great place to work for someone who doesn't actually want to work. i personally enjoy having something to do and accomplish so i didn't last long at that company. time passes quite slowly when you don't have something productive to be doing.
good,"I would get sick every-time I came in. it was always a burden, management was horrible and made me do things that weren't my job just because I actually spoke up against the unfairness."
good,"Loved what I did at sprouts & concept of  the company, management is disorganized, without a clear direction, young and cut throat. Easy to be used and abused."
good,typical day at work was mostly various positions but not so great pay for all the work that you did and most of the time you didnt have time to finish
good,I enjoyed my job at sprouts.  Expectations were a bit high.  I wish I could have learned a lot more about vitamins and met with reps more often. I did not enjoy working both weekend days.
good,"They train you and then turn around and dismiss you from a job for what they told you to do. They don’t give you a chance to explain or to defend yourself. "
good,Retail is not for everyone but I enjoyed working at Sprout.Difficult customers is the hardest part of retail but my coworkers always let me Vent on break and it made things better
good,Fast paced work. Good costumer service.  Good management.  Team players.  Good discount.  Great place to work.  Very busy.  Flexible hours.  Great customers.
good,"Very Fast Paced at times but work may not get done within the time frame it should because they will leave you to do things by yourself, but when you’re trained they make it seem like you will be helped."
good,"At first it sounded like a great company...especially through the orientation they give. It's alot of rah-rah stuff,however they don't necessarily follow their own example. For one thing they kept telling us to give it a chance there for at least 90 days...apparently it doesn't work the other way around,because after already 2 days they demoted me and then started going after me for petty things and things I really didn't even have a chance to learn. Why I was targeted I don't know,it's too early to know anything about anyone in that time. Then they cut my hours from 5 days to 2...maybe they're trying out their system on me. Either way it just doesn't seem fair."
good,"Its ok, could be better but the people that work there are kind. The staff themselves are kind and work together well, management sometimes blunders but it could be worse."
good,"This is a fun, fast passed environment. Main areas: cash handling using a register, customer service. This was the two main areas of the position. Once in management, it was more customer service, cash handling and scheduling the front end. Overall a fun place to work."
good,"It was difficult to get the amount of hours I wanted, and the cashiers were always understaffed. Management changed too often. Courtesy Clerks are forced to round up carts and it can be physically strenuous."
good,The company worked around my schedule while I was going to college. It teaches you people and customer service skills. Management wasn't always supportive.
good,I was treated very fairly and was paid well. My co-workers were kind and good team players. The environment was also very healthy and pleasant to be around on a day to day basis.
good,"Company is solid."
good,"Culture is good, there is not much room if any for advancement to a higher position. It is fast paced like most businesses, but they are a small company acting like a large Corp but without adequate infrastructure."
good,Usually out of most products and sale items. The most enjoyable part is i got to work early in the morning when no one was around.  I liked the discount that they gave employees.
good,I have friends in the workplace but your typical friend that you exchange words every so often.  Like right now I'm feeling stressed and not so friendly attitude toward one of my co-worker.  She always had something to say about how i do my work.
good,"Working for Sprouts is great.  The comradery is great.  There are systems and you get paid every week. The work is physical but fair. If you like working with people, stocking and walking for 8 hours a day it is a great gig."
good,"Typical day usually involves bathroom maintenance, bagging groceries, bringing in carts, sweeping floors. It's a pretty chill environment and they know when to appreciate good employees (definitely a step up from my last job). The only thing I would change is the lack of communications with upper management. Sometimes communicating the small things can get more complicated than it probably should."
good,"I will be honest Sprouts is a wonderful place for college students because in my experience they pay more than fast foods low pay mostly they will pay you at least 9 to 10 an hours. They also do pretty well working with your schedule...however if you  looking for 40 hours a week forget it! Unless you are a senior or manager you won't get full time hours and they will cut hours during slower times of the year...i live in a college town so it got sort of slow during summer and at times during holidays like everywhere else where i live unless you work for a major retail cooporation. The perks are cool you get 15 percent discount on anything which is not bad, uniforms are free and if management is happy they give you ""star cards"" which is basically a 5 dollar gift certificate for anything except alcohol, free uniforms, and they offer benefits pretty quickly provided you work enough hours, they  very competitive based with hours especially if you are a cashier so if you do your job well they will make it worth your time from my experience at my store in Norman, Oklahoma."
good,Good place to work overall. Everyone works together as a team to provide excellent customer service and brand building. Sprouts is known for internal promotions.
good,The hardest part of the job is the hours.  Typically day starts at 4 a.m. and once a month the job requires two 2 a.m. starts. After doing this for a year I would prefer normal hours and weekends/holidays off.
good,"Fun Place to work, enjoyable customer experiences . Overnight work at the deli is a little demanding. Requiremnets from the company directly conflict with day to day requirements from management. Took this job to work somehwere that requires me to take my breaks but was suprised to find that wasn't the case. Overall treats employees well."
good,"The work there was easy and always had something to do or something that could be done to kept busy. Co-workers were great, but management was sub-par with poor hiring practices and promotional practices."
good,Service culture with fast paced work environment.  High turn over and stressful when dealing with turnover and call outs during busy days.  Training needs to  be improved.
good,"It was alright, lay back for the most part but definitely mess with your hours and not consistent. You would start with plenty hours and then just have a drastic cut. Very roller coaster hours not really secure."
good,Good place to work if you want to learn basics of food service and grocery work. I often found the turn over rate higher than the hire rate and too many conflicting schedules.
good,It was very face paced from the time you walk into the deli. You start by preparing potato salads/ fresh garden salads. Then strip whole chickens to make chicken salads.After everything is packaged you make prepackaged sandwiches and go right to the line.
good,Like the product sold and interaction with the customers. Didn’t like the negativity from the management. Didn’t like the inconsistant hours. 20 hours on week and five the next
good,The managers their regularly harass their employees but everyone on the crew was very nice and hard working. The pay was average for the area cost of living and there are quarterly bonuses but no raises. You can move up but it's never worth and management was a revolving door. They didn't want to hear anything out if you ask about the open door policy which was a total fraud.
good,Come to work with a positive attitude.  Be willing to work extra hours in case multiple call outs happen. Be respectful and fair to one another. Work hard
good,"This could be a good first job, not a career. Customer service is the number one priority. Fifteen percent off everything. And the coworkers are all very friendly."
good,Job was very fast paced but management picky and unstable. Could do the same job one day and next day they would want it done differently.  My manager was nice but store manager and above not always aware how to get a job done.
good,"When you work in the retail industry for a smaller establishment, you quickly learn that your future in large part depends on the amount of customers your company gets. This changes daily. Management was clearly uncomfortable when sales were down for just one day."
good,"I really enjoyed working here, great environs t great people, management is a bit dodgey and really need to fix there policy on how they treat they're employees"
good,"I have been working for Sprouts as a deli clerk for 2 years. The job is secure, the work isn't difficult and my day is relatively good and passes quickly. You're mostly prepping food products for the sales floor and slicing meat and cheese for customers. We also make sandwiches. The problem with this job is management (as with most retail jobs). Store managers are quick to put a lot of pressure on department managers by demanding large amounts of work to be done regardless of how small the staff is for the department. NO excuses, just make it happen. This causes the department managers to require an undoable amount of work from their staff. They get in trouble for doing the best they can, which leads to clerks getting lectured more on what they didn't accomplish rather than what they do accomplish. No credit is given, only complaints. You are not allowed to get overtime even though the department is understaffed and want to accomplish all of your tasks (which cannot be done in 8 hours). You do your best everyday and even though you know you did a good job the department manager is quick to break you down for whatever they can, which makes you feel hopeless and unfairly treated."
good,"must stand all day on my feet.  work part time.  schedule always varies.  they help with community service and recycling.  thety dont like to train you , learn it the first time or else"
good,Not great. I worked really hard as cashier and gave exceptional customer service but management only seemed to noticed if  I made a mistake. This job didn't make me feel great at the end of the day.
good,Sprouts farmers market has given me tools to advance in a professional manner for my future and in new environments by giving me the knowledge and understanding of becoming knowledgeable and learning of health and wellness whilst making each and every customer experience exceptional and making the brand of Sprouts standout above competing grocery stores.
good,"A diverse environment, plenty of challenges and opportunities to learn new skills. For the most part, worked independently, but always had assistance via email/phone available."
good,"The job itself isn't difficult, the employees are nice but there is a lot of turn over due to lack of advancement/ opportunity. I would definitely recommend the job to someone in between work or as a side job but if its your only means of income it can be difficult"
good,"Daily tasks would include setting full service meat and seafood cases, cutting and wrapping all meat for self service case, creating production lists for all staff, placing orders for all product needs, reviewing and receiving all incoming product, maintain a clean and safe work environment and consistent quality customer services."
good,Typical day at work customer service.  I learned to work hard and work as a team with my coworkers.  Management has been accommodating with my needs. Enjoyed working with my coworkers
good,"In the beginning Sprouts Farmers Market was incredible the staff, the environment, the products.  It's Just sad to see a company wain and suffer internally by changing policies after massive public overhaul."
good,Sprouts farmers markets is a great company for those who are looking for their first job or who are interested in building a business career. Along that their benefits are decent and the employees overall are friendly.
good,Sprouts is a good company with good intentions. I believe it is just moving way too fast for its own good. No real culture in the stores. Management team has little to zero work-life balance.
good,It wasnt my favorite college job but it paid the bill. Towards the end I was finally recognized for my work and was offered a promotion... I was there for a year and a half.
good,"At the Carlsbad, Ca location I was quickly made to Juice Bar manager which was great. Hard work but enjoyed it. In Roseville I did straight deli and sometimes meat department. Am a vegetarian and was looking to get transferred to another department. No openings. The management tried and let me know on any options. Nice people."
good,"Sprouts was great when it first opened here in Norman, I loved it and so did everyone else. When the company went public, however, that's when pay went down and they chopped everyone's hours and benefits, and began digging for reasons to run everyone off who was paid too much, but also in general. Management can be pretty horrible."
good,High turnover rates create opportunities for those seeking to learn many areas of the grocery franchise. The company is a bit archaic in terms of technology.
good,"I started off as a cashier and within a few months I was able to move up into the bakery. Overall, I loved it and didn't really want to leave. I needed normal work hours (8am-5pm) because the stress of the 3am shifts were starting to affect my health. Most managers were understanding and helpful. Most co-workers were friendly and if you missed a day due to family issues or illness, they would all ask you if they/you were feeling better the next time you came in. Customers were normally pretty nice and understandable if you didn't know an answer and had to get another employee."
good,"This company is politically run. You have to earn your votes for promotion despite your hard work and sales goals. Then if you don't brown nose management, they treat you like scum of the earth. Jump down your throat because you can't finish everything you are supposed to do and get breaks and lunches/dinners in when it's just you and ONE cashier and no courtesy clerk to get carts or bag. Plus the mandatory floor sweep hourly. Seriously, line to the back of the store and can't move... but yeah let me sweep the floor, will you hold plz."
good,Managers never once complemented any employee to the best of my knowledge in the the two years I was there.This was the worst management team I have ever worked for. The work its self was enjoyable and the customers where great.
good,"I Worked at Sprouts Farmer's Market part-time for only 3 months, although it's a short experience for me i do learn a lot on that job and will use it to be a more productive and easy to learn person and or employee."
good,good for students to work part time. not so great for people who look for full time. they work well with students schedules or even with family emergencies.
good,"This is a good company to work for. I feel that the management needs to be trained better, there is a very big lack of communication through out the store."
good,"Sprouts is perfect of the teenager or young adult just starting out. it's fast paced, hours are steady, pay is better than minimum wage. However, in terms of work/life balance and job advancement, the company is lacking. It is difficult to take time off when needed and advancement opportunities are difficult to come by even for those interested."
good,consistency is important. worked at the produce department where work is mundane. you learned a lot about produce but not much else. management needs training
good,"I was at this job for 13 months and enjoyed it. Would not return as I have outgrown this place. Management when I was there was lacking towards the end of my tenure, hence my departure."
good,Always lots of work to be done.  Fast paced and each store is different from another depending on the store director.  I learned a lot working for Sprouts and really enjoyed my job most days.
good,"When I first stared, it was the best place I had ever worked.  People actually cared about the Company direction, but never put that in front of the basic needs of the team members."
good,The deli has the highest turnover rate out of all other sprout stores in the region. woking in it is difficult but easy once you get used to it. you are constantly busy with few if any breaks.
good,Nothing special or difficult. Basic tasks that would be done at any grocery store. There were opportunities to move up rather quickly if you showed the right attitude and were available.
good,"overall work experience was fine, however management is constantly rotating and not stable and seems to be ""Manager Roulette"", sometimes you get a really good one followed by a really bad one."
good,"Come in at 7 A.M. walk department for future errors in aisles. Do purchasing reports, stock reports and go over possible pre-orders. Around 9 A.M. fill sale items to shelf and fix displays. Create tasks for employees and begin stocking orders to aisles. All this time, asked many questions on products and where products are. At the end of the day, write orders for the next two days."
good,"Very stressful environment, employees are paid enough, felt unappreciated, corporate makes unnecessary changes, benefits are nice, paid time off is nice"
good,The team members at Sprouts are mainly kids who just got out of high school and people who do not really need a job but want to occupy their time and get paid for it. Then we have the managers who all know each other and advancement is hard when you are not close with a hiring manager. This is typical of any company. Grow your career with Sprouts by getting cross trained everywhere and learn the business to move up.
good,"not consistent week to week on how many you will get, and yet your full time."
good,"Busy helping customers and can be fun.  Helping customer and keeping the department can be a challenge but that's what makes it worth it.  Helping out in the meat department, bakery department and being able to be a back up checker made the day go by faster."
good,"Job was pretty flexible. Will to train in multiple areas. Pay wasn’t that great. Friendly customers, fun environment and driving distance was perfect for me"
good,"Answered incoming customer service phone calls. Handled and counted cash on hand. Assisted and resolved customer complaints."
good,"It's a good first job that's about it,I wouldn't suggest making a career out of this there are much better jobs out there if you just look hard enough."
good,Sprouts was nice for the discount but working there was really meh. I enjoyed some of the people I worked with but there were some stinkers. It was alright.
good,"Liked the atmosphere, it encouraged you to eat healthy. Learned a lot about probiotics and kambucha, etc. Learned about a lot of different kind of produce that I hadn't heard of before. Tried a lot of new items."
good,It is an ok company to work for if your looking for an decent job. hours are good pay is ok but room for advancement is horrible. Its is a good place to work if you like to work in a govery store environment.
good,"The overall feel of the team is friendly and inclusive, however there is only part time employment so there are no benefits unless you are in a management position. There is room for advancement if you show potential."
good,"Working for Sprouts, I have learned that there are ebbs and flows to a growing company. Lots of challenges, but opportunity for growth for those who want it."
good,"My work experience depended on the customers &how staffed we were. My typical day at work included: providing customer service, cashiering & cleaning."
good,"It's not bad for a job to work while you are in college or high school but I would not recommend working here as a full time job. I started out happily working in the bakery department when I was transferred out because of my ""school schedule"". I was switched to a position with way fewer hours and less pay, I also did not enjoy this position. I was recently moved to being a cashier, but do not enjoy it, still get paid less, and never have promised hours. Besides the discounts and my coworkers, it has not been my favorite place to work."
good,"Although I enjoy working for the company and enjoy the people I work with, I do not like that they give no actual training. They instead throw you into a position"
good,"My biggest complaint is the cutting of hours. I've gone from 40 hours/week down to 30 over the last year. That's a big chunk of what I make. They cut hours but still expect the same productivity. Also, the health benefits are pretty expensive, about $37/week, although I am glad to have them."
good,"A typical day at work was cutting deli meat, making sandwiches and preparing meals for customers. I also was a cashier so I did cash handling and customer service."
good,Always an opportunity to move up but pay increase extremely minimal. They have the do more with less mentality and care more about customers than anything else. They will sacrifice employees for an easy buck. Worked here for 2 years and learned how to survive more than how to cut meat. In fact those that I worked side by side with were amazing but the second a regional guy came in they had a chip on their should with a something to prove attitude and wreck anything you had that worked. They don't care about customer demographic they only care about making sales they way they used to. Not a strong integral company at all. Sad to see the way they treat employees.
good,Understaffed in the deli department. Having to work twice as hard because there is not enough people. If there were enough people is would be ok. Very labor intensive.
good,"Overall good place to work. The pay is pretty decent in Meat Market and promotion is easy if you have a good work ethic and skill at your craft. The downside is, most of the time managment wants to cut hours but expects same amount of production. Most stores are short handed."
good,"The work environment can be really stressful. Sometimes management is not as knowledgeable as they could be, due to lack of proper training. Overall it was an OK place to work"
good,"working at Sprouts is boring."
good,"Unload incoming trucks onto U-boats and stock to shelves."
good,"Work was fine, management was bad. Just do your work and everyone is happy. Hours were short (3 hour shifts?!). Lack of communication everywhere. I liked the store, but the people running it took advantage of their people. Management played favorites everywhere which left some coworkers in bad spots. All the day one crew got shipped to ""Closers"" only and the new crew (handpicked by our fair management) became the day crew with double the hours we had. Overall I can't say I enjoyed working at a spot I had the idea I'd enjoy. However, Sprouts gave me a lot of insight on customer service and how to run your own department while your department manger happens to have another ""sick day"" that following week. Also knowledge on supplements can help you open other doors. If it's one thing I could say to the CEO, it'd be please make sure the people you hire to run your shops have ACTUAL work experience and have actual good work ethic. Because one thing was for sure, everyone in that shop was getting played, one way or the other."
good,Retail position consisting of three separate positions due to career progression.  An enjoyable experience working in a team orientated environment as well as interacting with the public on a daily basis.
good,It was a fair and easy job as long as you followed  all safety  rules and did your job correctly  take lunches and breaks  correctly . I  worked with a scangun rode a palletjack or forklift placed the correct  items on the pallet wrapped the pallets when orders were finished the dropped  them in the correct  lines  on the docks to be shipped out
good,"As a bagger you are supposed to bag groceries and grab carts but at this place you had to do that on top of doing an entire store sweep every 30 minutes, cleaning up any messes, emptying trash cans, running groceries out to customer cars and maintaining the cleanliness of the restroom. Too much work for one person and too little pay."
good,Sprouts was a great company to work for. Not only do they care about their customers but their employees too. They create a fun working environment that also gives you the opportunity to grow and Excel.
good,"Because the store is so small it is easy to move up or learn at faster pace. Would strongly recommend applying to a small, friendly, and encouraging environment."
good,"Since the very first day I started there, I was blown away by the company's lack of top-down communication. The daily routine of Sprout's some how always feels disorganized and thoughtless - as though so much of the wrong thing was considered from upper management and handed down as a priority. Or there is no communication at all, and utter madness will break loose if a bigwig walks the store. My time there wasn't awful, I left on good terms, but I will say that working there quickly became unfulfilling. Favoritism and poor communication are this company's crutch, and those who takes advantage of it will spin this shortcoming into ""company philosophy."" The turnover at Sprout's is outrageous, and that should tell you something if you are interested in working here."
good,I worked as a price analyst. It was working early morning hours. It's quick paced and can sometimes be a handful! I liked the quick pace. You're always on your feet so definitely prepare yourself for that.
good,"Easy and repetitive for the most part, not too strict nor too lenient. Not too many faults to be had but the lack of management can make one pull their hair out."
good,"Working there as a Bulk Foods Clerk, Sprouts' seemed like a very stressful environment to work in, due to the overall atmosphere of being sanitized. A typical day at work is mostly labor in cleanliness style. What I learned from Sprouts' is that being physical takes a lot out of you and in order to maintain this, you got to have the strength and muscle to do so."
good,"As I began working with Sprouts, I got to adapt to a new environment and new people. It allowed me to step outside of the box and learn new and exciting things. I learned how to deal with money and calculations as I worked as a cashier. My manager was very impressed by my skills for me being so young. The customers were very diverse and friendly along with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was keep a thing fast paced on a busy day. My most enjoyable part of Sprouts Farmers Market was finding out about new types of vegetables and foods."
good,"A typical workday was fast paced and the management was always helpful. The workload was heavy, but it was mostly doable tasks.  I enjoyed talking to the customers. They were normally nice."
good,I disliked that they always sent me home and I was less than part-time. I loved the people I worked with but the management had way too high of expectations. I didnt qualify for benefits and wasn't working there long enough for them to count my morning sickness as maternity leave. They aren't union so they were overly cautious of their budget.
good,"When I worked for Sprouts, I felt like those above me looked down on me. It made me feel bad. The only thing that I enjoyed about the job were the other co-workers I talked with. They understood what I was going through and it made things easier to deal with."
good,"They are ok. If they offer you a promotion don't take it right away cause they can give someone the same position for a hire pay if they hire them off the streets and not from within. They base it on a percentage and that completely screws you. You could end up making 12.50 as an assistant deli manager when the average is 14-16 and hr. But you have to talk to your division manager and when I talked to mine he wouldn't give me the pay I should I've had even though I brought facts with numbers on average assistant managers in the area from our company and others. I was way below the minimum. He just didn't care and said I just don't work hard enough.... in less than a year I went from part time to assistant deli manager I'm a better worker than he is. I had compliments on a daily basis and I had a customer hear him say that and confront him saying I was the best employee they have ever had the pleasure of  talking to and they always wait for me to help them whether it is 30 seconds or 10 minutes. They always wait cause I'm just that good. And they weren't the only customers that do that. This company isn't terrible just some of their priorities, procedures, and rules are dumber than a goldfish"
good,"They are more willing to lose essential employees, game changers if you will, Due to minor tardiness issues witch throws entire departments into chaos and subsequently effecting store sales witch inevitably effects employee's hours, furthermore effecting store sales, Then cut the policy and  avoid this landslide of unsatisfied customers and employees. I'm not about sprouts and believe the customers are getting very fed up with it to. I mean Half of the reason people enjoy shopping at a place is, yes, the products and price but most importantly  the service aspect.  As an employee can truly keep them coming back because YOU make them feel at home while they are shopping at sprouts. They don't even think about the price and you can promote sales with wonderful guest satisfaction. But the emphasis of the company isn't customer or employee based. All they care about is keeping the doors open another day."
good,Your average run of the mill grocery store. Not much to state but a balanced team and dedicated workers made it a decent experience. Overnights ran a bit more smoothly than what I saw during the day.
good,"its a good job. with good people.learn new things and meet new people.mangement good.good hours,good ethics and easy job skills and good co-workers.an"
good,"Sprouts was great, for a while. The management at store 312 in Boulder is awful. The store manager is a complete buzzkill, & is never positive. I am not sure why so many people work here, but I guess when you need money what can you do?"
good,"On a typical day I would check in, and get started immediately at my register. I would help open and close at times (handle registers, pull tills, clean register, up stock) I learned a lot about client interaction skills, memorization skills. The hardest part of the job was not always having enough help. My most enjoyed part of this job would be interacting with people."
good,Decent pay and there is job security but moving up seems to be a game of favorites. Good benefits and quality of life. Young company that has a lot of potential but still finding itself.
good,"Depending on where you work sprouts is great. I had the best manager very sweet , accommodating , made me feel like family. I worked in summerlin nv and la canada ca. The la canada store was horrible. Management was very bad , they had disgusting areas. But summerlin store was amazing ."
good,"Typical day at work consisted of meeting peoples need and backing the customer is always right policy. I learned how to bag groceries, clean restrooms, hourly cart runs, hourly store sweeps, stacking fruit, provide customer service. Management wasn't all that great in 2013 as managers elected favorites. Co-workers were mostly friendly excluding the head cashiers. Hardest part of the job was not having a set schedule that was beneficial. Most enjoyable part was receiving 25% discount on all groceries."
good,"very stressful, most of the time your alone with a million things to keep up with. closing by yourself is the worst co workers talk behind your back alot too, very unprofessional and lots of favoritisim"
good,The management can be difficult at times and their is never enough workers around. The pay for the work doesnt add up. I hate this review box.
good,I was very unhappy with this workplace I was not able to have a qual opportunity as my coworkers because my supervisor had a personal issue with me.so unprofessional!
good,Sprouts is generally a very busy market. The produce is excellent and it's a good place for a starter job and they provide a lot of room to grow as an employee.
good,Typical grocery company. Typical attitude towards employees. Typical benefits. Typical hours. Typical work day. Just because it is a healthy food store don't expect any more of a healthy attitude from management. Grocery is grocery. Expect the same.
good,"Typical day at work is busy on the weekdays, I learned how to deal with customers who are having a bad day and new products. The management sucked because they didn't know how to deal with customers and they weren't flexible with hours and employees. My co-workers where amazing it was an awesome experience making new friends. The job was not hard at all. Most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things about the local customers."
good,"greeting customers, answering phone calls, and checking out customers. while working at sprouts i learned the fruit codes. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. The environment was the best part of the job because I feel when you have a awesome team around you, it only boosts yourself for the better."
good,very good workplace for self motivated person.offers employee shopping discount is a plus. friendly helpful management team. most of the co-workers are friendly.
good,"A typical day at Sprouts included staying focused and finishing all tasks at hand. This job included little socializing with co-workers, as it was frowned upon, but taught me to become a well rounded individual who worked hard in order to gain a promotion. Being promoted to a vitamin clerk was a very proud moment in my life, I worked hard for a year in order to reach that position."
good,"A busy day, we had a lot of sales going on, customers were in and out with satisfactory faces. I really enjoy making a customer happy and going out of the door with a big smile. Great customer service is everything!"
good,hours vary depending on the time of year. there are always new people as others quit all the time. nothing else to say just wasnt a fun job.
good,I enjoy working at Sprouts Farmers Market all though I would love to retire from the retail jobs and focus more on what I want my career to be. I want to go into the Medical Field as an Ultrasound Tech. Sprouts Farmers Market has definitely taught me some things. Over all it is a good place to work.
good,"At sprouts there is a strong emphasis on helping consumers find what they need. There is still need for developing organizational structure as there are many inconsistencies in career movement and development. Relative to management at other large retailers, Sprouts core store management seem to need development in various areas, such as knowledge of company protocol."
good,"imagine everyone treating you like garbage & being literally covered in garbage because they buy the cheapest garbage bags & they break all over you. yeah that's what working at sprouts as a courtesy clerk is like. but it was cool to get discounts & the coworkers were pretty cool (most of them). idk, it's really not that bad but i didn't have the best experience. they never remembered when i called in sick & i would get in trouble for ""missing work"" when i called in & got it okayed. also they always forgot that i wasn't available some days & i had to remind them every time the schedule came out because they would schedule me on those days."
good,"when i first started it was alot of fun, but then i found out i was pregnant and they fired me. I was late a couple times due to having a rough pregnancy and ended up on bed rest."
good,"The work, especially in the vitamin department, was fun and engaging. I learned a great deal, and I will probably always keep and value that knowledge. Unfortunately, the company made moves to expand which were not very successful. This hurt the company and, in turn, the employees and customers."
good,management isn't its best but great people to work with some harder customers but it gives you a challenge hours weren't the best but pay was excellent!
good,High paced specialty market that meets the needs of gluten and vegetarian dietary expectations. Room for rapid promotion and relocation. Expanding nationwide allowing for many new positions.
good,"Decent starter job, which allows employees to gain knowledge about a multitude of jobs, including food handling, customer service and cashier experience."
good,the manager cussed out my manager and fired her on the floor in front of other employees then they cut hours and were giving everyone like 10 hours a piece.
good,This company has a good atmosphere. I work with great co-workers who have a positive attitude and worked with smiles on their faces. I enjoy working here.
good,Sprouts Farmer Market has allowed me support myself and accommodate my schedule so that I could pursue multiple degrees in IT.
good,It is a fun place to work . Coworkers are kick back .Management is real easy to get long with.Like any job it has its ups and downs.
good,Is growing way too fast and underpays its employees to make up the money for opening new stores. When people I knew used to work  for Sprouts it wasn't as corporate and treated its employees well. Not the case anymore!
good,The reason why my job was so great was because of my manager and how they wanted each one of their employees to succeed. They gave us the tools and help needed to be successful.
good,I like working for Sprouts.  They are fast growing and a fun place to work.  However they seem to be too concentrated on payroll and financials and not about their people anymore.
good,This was a fun and very understanding work place. The employees were very nice. Management worked with you. there is a lot of things that were a little confusing such as training but when you get the hang of things it gets easier.
good,The store i work at is busy but the but my co-worker are nice and very laid back.The training is not the greatest. I fill the bulk food area  all day and that can get very mundane. The best part of my job is getting to try new foods. Management wants the employees to know how great their food is.
good,Sprouts trained me as a bakery clerk.  Always something to do and my day goes by fast.  The employees are friendly and will help you if you ask.
good,Smiths was a good company just the location that I worked at was in a bad area of town and had a lot of shop lifters and a few rude customers.
good,"This company has good insurance benefits, a 401k plan. Wonderful co-workers and an active and varied work environment. "
good,I learned how to become a leader within this company. I began as a department manager in a minor department and grew to become a store 3rd. Mgr. who oversees over 5 departments as well as the store. From this company i have learned how to operate a store on a day to basis. The co- workers are fun to be around and full of great energy. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with customers and providing them with great quality products.
good,"It was a nice and good place to work at, the only problem was that they did not give workers enough hours."
good,This Company has done well in it's merging with Sunflower Market and becoming a publically traded company.
good,"The Spouts team is a close knit group, I learned a lot from experienced employees and corporate management about product availability and seasonal products that were foreign to me. A typical day there could be a hectic because the store was usually packed with hungry customer."
good,I started working at this company a month before they changed owners before the new owners it was Sunflower Market less corporate and now its too corporate they didnt ease us into the new owners it was just like we got thrown in there.
good,Must be accurate and diligent. Tem Environment and fast pace
good,"A typical day at work was busy"
good,"a typical day at work consisted of following management guidance and working a full shift with little breaks and the store could get extremely busy at times with little or no help in certain departments. Many of the workers here don't seem to care about their jobs so the general neglect of job duties from others usually falls on those who value their jobs and work hard, and store management failed to notice this problem."
good,"A typical day a work consist with helping and assisting customers with products."
good,Management demands more than labor can do. People are fun to work with. Very rule strict.
good,"Working  at Sprouts was a very interesting job experience. "
good,"A typical day working at Sprouts is all about customer service. I learned store values and conditions. Store manager had no idea what he was doing most of the time. It was fun to work with all the other employees , it made work more enjoyable."
good,Employees are being kept in limbo about the status of ther jobs. My work load has dramatically decreased.
good,"Decent pay, and work well around school hours, employees are friendly and helpful."
good,"Good benefits, low paying job for a manager position "
good,Not enough hours givien seniority priorty is given to new hires over senior employees. People are not rotated around cant necessarily transfer departments
good,It is a fast pace work environment with some days being stressful. Management is getting better. The pay should be a little more for what is required.
good,"As a cashier, you are constantly on your feet and working with customers. Customer service is extremely important as most people expect a good experience when coming to Sprouts, especially when they're dropping over $100 on groceries. It has it's stressful moments but there are benefits of talking to customers and coworkers and learning about different health food products."
good,"At sprouts farmers market, I learned many skills that which I believe helped me in daily work life there, but only a few could be applicable to other job."
good,If you are looking for your first job Sprouts is easy to get in to and it also has a flexible schedule if you are a student .You also have the benefit of their employee discount of 15%.
good,Working the deli would take a lot of prepping. And would get very busy and very fast. I learned to make a proper sandwich which would have customers returning. The employees were fine to work with. Though sometimes shorthanded. Could be stressful. Management was nice and fair enough. A couple of them really stood out to help with any questions we might have had.
good,"The meat department is located in the corner of the store, the work can range from busy to slow depending on the day.  I learned an array of recipes for home consumption and ways to prepare food.  The people there are nice, with the hardest part being knowing tiny details about the origins of the food.  The best part is learning new recipes for home."
good,Overall working at sprouts was a great experience but the management was in dire need of help. I met so many great people working there ! Everyone was great but the managers need to learn how to communicate
good,"Most aspects of the facility are pleasant. If I were in a dual income household I may have been willing to stay longer. The culture, the product and team members are generally agreeable."
good,"I had fun and liked running around the store on my own. I got to help customers and make sure everything stayed clean. I even got a 15% discount on everything in the store, but.. We got a new manager who was kind of a jerk. He didn't run the store well, was grumpy to everyone (including customers), and was very harsh with his criticism. I tried to avoid him most of the time, honestly. Our previous manager was a much nicer guy."
good,"Enjoyable to return to work after an eight year absence , A return to my trade of meat cutting . Both my store manager and district manager called me a machine and promised me a raise which they then reneged on."
good,"Loved working here, just did not get enough hours and scheduling was not consistent. Everyone who works there is friendly and hard working and will be willing to help you out if you need help"
good,We were not able to go on the correct lunchtime half of the time being there and we also had at least four breaks we would at least barely get one during the day
good,"The morning time is the slowest shift, because no one is up shopping at 7 in the morning. Ringing people up all day, there are a ton of food codes to learn, so if you have a bad memory this is not where you need to apply. Management is cool, they talk to you like you're an equal. There is a good bit of diversity. Reiterating the hardest part of the job is learning the codes, but it comes naturally after you've seen them a hundred times in one day. The most enjoyable part is interacting with the nice fun and upbeat co workers and customers. Nice customers really make the environment!"
good,I worked at Sprouts for 2 years. I made some great friends and connections. The problem is the lack of communication from the top down. It ended up becoming a problem with not being able to get what I had earned.
good,"there is ALWAYS something to do in the deli...no down time!"
good,"Sprouts Farmer's Market has a great work environment. The employees that work there are very down to earth, and the products within the store help promote healthy living. Unfortunately, the compensation for the work that one puts forth could definitely be better. Since Sprouts is also a fairly smaller company among other corporations such as Albertsons, Raleys/Bel-Air, then there is not many opportunities for promotion. When an opportunity for promotion arises, the compensation is quite underwhelming compared to what other companies would offer for the same position."
good,"Sprouts work team & managers were all wonderful, I was always so thankful for discounts on my supplements & groceries. What I didn't like was the inconsistent work hours and being scheduled to close one day & open the next. With 10 yrs experience working in vitamins/supplements they only offered me just over $11 hourly who can live on that. Also why do they throw away so much expired product when it could go home with the employees?"
good,"I started working for this company when it was private.  Since it went public, it's gone downhill.  There's a lot of ""throw newbies in to the fire from the frying pan"" type of training.  Especially as a cashier or courtesy clerk."
good,"Morning shift in the deli can be stressful, as one person is required to do several positions because employees don't stay."
good,"Store management constantly changes, inconsistent management styles, management doesn't always know important information needed to run each department"
good,"Working in the bakery at Sprouts Farmers Market is a fairly normal experience, nothing bad nothing really great, and do not get me wrong, it is not a bad place to work at.  Making the breads and desserts in the bakery just makes you smell good when you come home.  I am not that passionate about food and baking but if you are then you will love to work here.  They give you a 15% discount for working in the store, but because the prices are higher at Sprouts the 15% makes it similar to normal Stater Bros prices."
good,"The company is not a bad place to work at. Most of the other employees are good people, and good to work with. The management could use some improvement, but the people that I've dealt with usually understand and accommodate. Overall, it's a good first job."
good,I have nothing bad to say with the company but the Management crew the have in positions are our for theirselves. You will be giving the Standard of Sprouts from day one but quickly you will find out that it is not up held at all. No one wants to help build a team. That's the truth. The company is Awesome though just some people can ruining what they are trying to build.
good,"There was practically no management, employees did what they wanted. The customers were extremely demanding and made work complicated. It was stressful trying to reinforce anything because management was to busy to be bothered."
good,Worked part-time at Sprouts while going to school full-time and it worked out well.  Pretty easy job but occasionally customers are difficult.  High turn-over rate for management.
good,"The worst part about sprouts is the people that shop there, management is okay, but most co workers are fun. Most co workers see this as a career and not as a job which is bad to think since most people that work there are 18-27"
good,"You can get written up for vomiting in the, deli, meat, or produce departmemts (which are all perishables clearly) and get written up for being sent home. Even though you finished closing the department. Everyone calls out because everyone hates working there. There a  decent benefits if you're full time, but opportunities for advancement are scare unless you wanna move halfway across the country."
good,A typical work day was in routine as always. rarely anything was new and the hardest part of the job was getting yelled at by my manager who didnt even know how to do her own job.
good,"Was a fun and exciting place to work. Friendly coworkers, busy most days. Room for advancement if youre really determined. They pay horribly though so they make all your hard work not worth it."
good,"If you love what you are doing you an overlook some of the shortcomings of a company. There are good people and bad people everywhere, including Sprouts. Fortunately there are enough good to make up for the bad (managers)."
good,"As a courtesy clerk you will be on your feet 24/7. Constantly bagging groceries, getting cart, and/or cleaning something. It is very difficult when you're trying to finish one task and a head cashier stops you to do 50 other task and finish the all within your shift."
good,"Feels like a dead end. After three years I still have no guarantee of 40 hours per week, and still make less than 12 dollar an hour. Never felt stressed or overwhelmed, downside being I was never really challenged to learn something new."
good,"very busy , not many hours, you do more than you are paid to do sometimes. Good company to work for besides a few down falls. I learned about healthier organic  foods .The most enjoyable is finishing your list of tasks you are assigned before your shift ends."
good,"its always busy never a dull moment, starts off picking up our orders in boxes, unloading and checking off from our orders. Cleaning our areas, stocking ,facing and making sure there's no empty shelves if we need to order. Customer service is always a must. Whenever the front end gets busy I fill in and checkout customers or fetch shopping carts outside and shopping baskets as well."
good,"Was a great place to work while I was there. Decent pay for me as I moved up quickly and didn't just sit idle."
good,"There is a major lack of recognition within the company. Those that work hard generally go overlooked unless they are consistently kissing up to the managers."
good,"It's a fun place to work, the people and management are great. Very busy store. Lots of customer service. Learned a lot about healthy eating. Most enjoyable part is it's very laid back enviroment"
good,"I liked Sprouts as much as one can working at a grocery store, however they make a lot of claims in orientation that never come true, and hours are never reliable because they change the schedule constantly. I do like the 15% off for working there and employee appreciation days."
good,Starting workdays at 4 am isn't everyone's cup of tea. Management will try to accommodate your needs but you must remind them several times for you to be taken serious. There is a grave lack of communication between upper and lower management. Team members are often left in the dark about important things. Lower management must struggle to find out the latest news trends and information.
good,"You will work with a fun team. I learned to work in a fast paced environment. The management were supportive, but this was not always the case across stores. The job is very fast paced, so it's not for everyone."
good,"I only worked there for 2 months before I quit and took an offer to work for Integrity Staffing Solutions instead. I was a Grocery Clerk, and zoned shelves and stocked freight. It's a nice place to work at with lots of fresh produce. I would recommend this job to others."
good,"Sprouts is a decent place to work. The staff are easy going and relaxed and fun to work with. The management has its flaws, however there is a lot of job flexibility."
good,"I love my boss, I do not like the new direction the company is taking. It's stretching employees too thin, covering too many shifts and/or jobs. Not enough hours to successfully run a business, strict labor quotas make it impossible for managers to give employees the pay they deserve. HR is TOO employee driven; give managers control of their store, let them fire unwanted employees! Sprouts gets stuck with bad, rude and lazy workers, making it a stressful, unpleasant, drama filled place to work."
good,"People are nice, the pay is ok, the hours were flexible. manageent was good at making sure things were done. room for improvement but overall a great esstablishment"
good,"The management I've had at my location has been overall pretty decent. I have not heard the same about some other locations."
good,"A typical day at work would involve many customer questions, and maybe a few customer complaints, but constant customer service. Stocking and facing of products and goods, scanning and printing tags and UPC codes for certain items, setting up displays, or demoing products for curious customers. "
good,"typical day at work is helping customers and prepping product, management is friendly, co-workers and management are easy to talk to and are flexible with employees attending college. hardest part of the job is dealing with customers that have a bad attitude. but working with good working friends helps deal with the troubles."
good,"It's a fun and fast paced place to work.! I worked in the meat department and they had great deals, every customer are satisfied with sprouts and their products!"
good,"This job is good as a starter job, but I would not recommend as a job to make a career in. The management is not very proactive and are slow to act when things go wrong or someone presents any kind of problem to them."
good,"Sprouts offers a great variety of produce at great prices. Its a fast-paced, work environment, and the customers are great! The staff is friendly too."
good,As a head cashier I interacted with every area of the store on a daily basis. Coworkers were very helpful and managers always have something for you to do. It was a very physical and mental job that required a lot of communication and multitasking skills.
good,"My typical day at the sprouts deli would start with scanning out shrink or food that has reached its ""sell by"". The next thing I would do is merchandise the sales floor before the store opened at 7am. If it was an order day I would check my back stock inventory and see what the department needed then make an order list. Orders are due before 9:30am so you have to work at a constant pace wich I prefer to do anyway. From then on I would continue any merchandising the department needed then finish the day serving customers anything from hot rottisorie chickens to fresh deli sandwiches."
good,"I absolutely loved everyone in this workplace. The people are incredible but once it gets to management it all gets very rocky. There is favoritism and people who do not know how to respect the employees who work for them. They will lead people on to management for years and train them to do the job for less money. Again, I loved the place, but management needs a little help."
good,"Pay can be a little better for the type of job that I do. Also, health benefits offered are not good. There is not really much room for advancement here. That is why I'm looking to move on."
good,During the 13 years I worked there I loved my job. There are good things about the company and bad hings as well. If you work hard & show them you can do it you will move up.
good,"i would clock in each day and there was always something to do, if i finished a job they always figured out something for me to do and it was a friendly work environment among employees and my boss or manager on duty was easy to talk to and communicate what was going on throughout each day. I learned alot about customer service each day and was able to see how everything was set up and why produce or different items were put in different spots and good ways to great and assist people. I learned alot about patience and staying friendly with tough customers as well as ways to figure out a solution to fix the problem at hand and do whatever it took to fill the needs of that customer. the best part about working was probably the employees and sometimes the people because it was fun and friendly, everyone was easy to talk to and have conversations with as well as able to get the work done in a timely manner."
good,"I like the ideas the company was built around such as health and wellness, but the management lacks structure and consistency. "
good,"Good company to work for, but benefits were horrible. Also, vacation days are very limited and only get one week a year and have to accrue it. I enjoy what I do, because im always kept busy and like to help others when help is needed."
good,"Working in the grocery department, I was tasked with breaking down a shipment from both our vendors, making sure our back stock gets worked from the back to the sales floor, facing the store, building endcap and side stack displays as well as on the floor pod displays. I also printed out daily sales reports, the shrink and audit reports. I also did the shrink and audits for the day, if any."
good,"responsible for cash and credit card transactions, returns. Answer customers questions and concerns. In daily interactions with customers I have learned that each person is unique and one must adapt to each circumstance. I am a team player and enjoy working with other co-workers. The hardest part of my job is having limited mobility. My most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and interacting with people every day."
good,"Working in a grocery store that just sells organic items. You attract a lot of different clients and is interesting to meet as well."
good,"A normal work day was always exciting because you never knew what was going to happen. I would be extremely busy from the time I clocked in until the time that I would clock out for the day. There was always work to do, whether it was in my department or somewhere else in the store.   My co-workers were fun and I would occassionally hang out with a few of them.  We were a family and we had each others back. Our Manager was down to earth, but we knew when he meant business and how far we could go.  He was a great mentor and friend. The hardest part of the job for me was that I had to put my feelings aside and discipline my back-up and write her up, but it was all business because at the end of the day I was her supervisor.  If I didn't I would have been in trouble, but the job comes first.  I really enjoyed my job for the most part, the best part was going to new stores and preparing them for the grand opening."
good,"A typical day consisted of being highly productive in the deli dept. whether you made meals, cupped salads, cut cheese, sliced meat, cooked rotisserie chicken regularly, provided customer service, make sandwiches for customers, or clean and close up shop. I learned excellent customer service skills, work ethic, and time management skills. The majority of co-workers were a pleasure to work with. The hardest part of the job was being able to multi-task while providing excellent customer service and exceed production expectations under osha regulations. The most enjoyable part of the job was the time spent with most co-workers."
good,"I learned that I need to be real active and being helpful with the customers. My management pushes me forward to succed in life. Im really helpful with my co-workers, really good job relationship with them. The hardest part of my job is always the customer, but with my patience I can settle almost every problem."
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,I left after 4 months because there was alot of incidences happening and manh of my fellow employees from all departments were complaining and they did nothing. Managers were mistreating us.
good,"Sprouts is a good place to work at. You get to meet new people, make new friends. The only concern that I have was the communication. The communication wasn't there as it should be. But overall was a good experience."
good,I worked there for more than a year and most of my coworkers were very friendly and customers were too. For a place to advance to a higher position is way difficult and don't recommend working at that retail.
good,"A typical day at work is always production and completion of "
good,"I love sprouts so much but when I worked there they didn't pay me enough for being there, I had to do 4 jobs  being there and only for $11.10 I worked so hard there but it ended up draining me and I became unmotivated to work so hard and earn so little."
good,I enjoy working at Sprouts but I think it's time to move on. I want to better myself. I have tons of experience in the work place. I enjoy being one of their highest paid and being one of the employees that's been working for them the longest. Since this store has opened.
good,"A typical day of work as a cashier would be standing behind my register scanning customers groceries while asking them about their day and shopping experience. If there was a lull in customers I would walk around to the front of my register and collect shopping baskets, straighten out the magazines at the front of my register, or simply stand at the ready for the next customer. The hardest part of the job would have to be the poor pay and the extremely busy days, there are times when morale will be at an all time low because you had to skip lunch to help the front end, but make barely over minimum wage."
good,"Worked 4am shift in the deli"
good,"your never safe as a part time associate,if they out lacking on sales,your hours will be cut to 8hrs a week.you work in multiple departments regardless if your a cashier."
good,"I been having a really good experience working for sprouts farmer market, I really like the kine of customer day by day arriving to this place, the management team is VIP all ways are there when are needed by employees or customer."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with. I was a courtesy clerk so I bagged groceries, gathered carts and a lot more. I did enjoy helping people find what they needed."
good,"Sprouts pays their employees very low hourly wages! Although they have employee appreciation dinners for us, I felt my hard work was taken for granted. I was constantly given too many duties and if I did not complete my duties management would be disappointed. How can they expect so much from employees who are not being paid fairly wages. It benefits the company to pay employees the minimum, so they can continue to profit revenues. Who wants to work for a company who rather open more stores rather than reward their employees with higher decent hourly wages?! Minimum wage cannot provide a living in California. “People don’t accept these low wages!” that’s why they continue to take advantage of their employees.I recommend this  job for students who are just passing by. "
good,"work in stock refill store up with items,clean up, work on items that need work on. All time hours pick up trash change boxes for trash. what every need to be done in stroe."
good,Working at sprouts is fast moving with time going by fairly quickly. Things change rapidly as do ads and sales within department. Mentoring department staff is challenging and most rewarding.
good,It would be a dope job if the pay was there. Responsibilities are not demanding coworkers are friendly just not worth the amount of time I spend there for the amount of money I make
good,A typical day of work consisted of me showing up to my department and having to make up lost ground due to lack of fellow employees in that department. Managers would rather send you home and have you come back that day to cover a call out or get OT rather than call someone in to cover the shift.
good,"Sprouts Farmer's Market was a very relaxed yet fast paced place to work, but after working there for almost three years and being promised multiple pay raises that never came it became time to call it quits."
good,"I worked here around 2 years and 6 months right after graduating high school and made a lot of friends with the coworkers that used to and currently work here. "
good,"Sprouts has lots of great values and ideas like composting and food rescue, but the management just doesn't pull through. Employees have lack of morale. Management just doesn't seem to care, and most managers don't seem happy working there. But everyone is nice and big wigs who come in often are nice too. Plus you get 15% discount on everything including alcohol on top of great prices."
good,"Loved working here and the management is awesome, but I was underpaid for the amount of work I performed. Understaffed in the departments I worked in so all of the work fell on to me"
good,"Coming into the Westwood location set expectations high for me. At the Huntington Beach location you needed speed, dedication, a positive attitude, and a willingness to work with the customer... this new location lacked many of these qualities unfortunately. While the management knew they had a job to do, and to do it as efficiently as possible, regardless of their personal feelings the lower level employees seemed like they were at times dragging their feet almost intentionally throughout the work day. The few that did care enough to do a good job, mostly the cashiers and managers, shined in their performance but could not reach their full potential with the poor work ethic of most of the other employees."
good,If you were looking to become a manager at sprouts or work your way up in career  with Sprouts I would recommend this job to you. For a college student the hours scheduled are hard to Balance with a full school schedule. Often times management isn’t very helpful and can make your job quite stressful and cause unhappiness. The first year was OK but now approaching two years I’m ready for something new
good,"While I filled every shift in the bakery at some point over the 2 years I spent there, early mornings were almost all of what I did. For 3 hours, you work with no oversight. And for the next 5, it was only marginal. If there was something I needed to know or learn, sprouts had it on their employee website for me. If I needed to make a decision regarding customer service, sprouts management leaves that decision entirely in my hands, patiently and until a customer complains - something that happened only once. If I wanted to set up extra displays for product I wanted to move, all I had to do was make sure I wasn't getting in anyone else's way. I loved this. It was a fantastic place for me to grow as a person."
good,"Sprouts Farmers Market was my first job, I gave it my all. The management was very good to me and the customers are some what polite. I learned a lot about being organized."
good,"flexible schedule, nice people, work shoes, work shirts provided salary is average, they give you a discount on store purchases, management is nice. room for advancement"
good,"Weekly payroll which was nice. "
good,"Pretty easy job overall, you have time to pick up other skills you might be missing, the management is fair but also still learning as well, the coworkers are very tight like a family."
good,The work is just like any other place but you'll love the people you work with. The managers are ehh just like any other place. You'll have to deal with all kinds of customers. (both really cool and really horrible)
good,Sprout's is a fast paced environment to work in. the down side is that your scheduled shifts will change weekly leaving little time to plan for family time
good,good if you want a career in retail.  not a lot of choices if you plan to grow. save your money when the holidays come around they will cut your hours to 32 or less
good,unorganized but enjoyed working with the customers.its working with lots of inexperinced kids. very high turnover rate .hard to get things fixed there.
good,"Sprouts had a list of chores for me to do in 1 hour. The chores include making sure the bathroom is clean and fully stocked, sweeping the whole store every 30 minutes, bagging groceries, cleaning up spills, collecting the garbage every hour, getting the carts outside and bringing them in every 15 minutes, and providing help to customers/ other employees."
good,"Vitamin department is the best department to work in."
good,"I have never worked in a deli so that was my first time being there, I learned that if u work hard and do your job you will get notice to moving up to getting promoted.. my enjoyable moment is having customers come for me to make there sandwich"
good,"I worked for this company for about a year and a half as a cashier. Pay was pretty terrible. Store management was alright, corporate was not the worst I have ever worked for, a few of the cashier leads were fairly terrible."
good,"Its a great work environment overall, once you get the job task down time just goes by. I highly recommend not working till closing though as you'll probably stay after original shifts cleaning the store."
good,"I enjoy working for Sprouts farmers Market. I enjoy my customers . I believe in the quality of the products in which they sell and the doors of the company. I would come in to work and write orders, break down loads, sweet up the staff for daily production and to make sure everything was ready for the ad. I would make sure the ads are correct. I would do paperwork to update sales check shrink (things we throw away, donate, or cattle feed). I would work all the back stock to the floor. Help customers to any question or problems they may have. I was the manager of the Deli department. I was to oversee 22 empolyees. The hardest part of my job was tying to get everything done in eight hours. There were more responsibilities that we are starting to do and I want to do them and help be in the department to help train my staff. I believe being around with the staff and working side bye side will help them grow in knowledge and make them strong team members."
good,sprouts is ot a bad company it just takes time to move up even tho you work your hardest and then some day and day out. bt the hardest part would be leaving. its a nice company with weekly pay but its not a place where you can make a career or support your family.
good,It wasn't the best to work cause of management aND only thing was great co-worker's . The  guidelines weren't cool flaky hours didn't show much more effort as helping their workers grow as a company. It was annoying to deal with them rushing  you when you  on assignment
good,"Sprouts is a good place to work, a very friendly atmosphere and competitive wages that reward your previous experience. My only problem is that it's incredibly difficult to advance out, or transfer out, of the Deli. Not sure if it is all Sprouts, but it was really difficult for employees to transfer out of the Deli due to the fact that the Deli needs more consistent help. It came to the point where several employees quit all together because they wanted to leave the Deli. "
good,I love the variety of the jobs I  have learned!  Doing something different all the time! Serving customers! Busy all the time which helps me get my 10000 steps a day!
good,"The pay is decent, the hours are flexible, and the benefits are nice! But the problem is management. The unfortunate thing is that it is not just department heads or store management but cooperate as well. The people are friendly but sometimes a little too friendly and favoritism was a big issue. Also, critical issues in the work place were often ignored or dismissed by the management team. But the job is not all bad. A typical day at work went by quickly and my co workers in my department were easy to work with. And although the management team were good people, they do not know how to run a store."
good,Help manage Meat dept. And bring up sales.help in ordering and manage the invetory.Help in kepting the cases full.help in up dateing scales
good,I like how in Sprouts is that its more of an independent job. You are giving a task and you can complete it in any way you want.
good,"It's a fun place to work, but management is terrible. There is no communication between morning shift and night shift. They tell you there are benefits after only working there for 3 months, but that is a lie. You get benefits after working there a year."
good,"answering customer questions in the department, stocking the shelves, answering the phone and taking customer orders. receiving the shipment on a daily. showing the customers where the products are located."
good,"it started wonderful but ended up going down hill fast. it is very dependent on the manager. i went from one of my favorite managers to one of my least favorite people. corporate had a phase of moving managers around and our store suffered from this change. i never knew our numbers but i could tell sales were way down. i tried to keep my full time hours by getting hours in 4 different departments. a bit of an overload but you have to make money. finally we had got new employees but i made more than them and thus had my hours chopped. first manager wanted quality work done, second wanted to have wages low. the vast difference shows that corporate had little influence in all of their stores."
good,"My job can be tedious, even boring at times. But thanks to my fun loving coworkers they make the day pass by wonderfully. I wish that everyone could go to work and have more days than not."
good,"typical day at work 8 hours on front register,managment was nice til they fired me for saying i did not call in sick which i did they would not grant me unemployment so i appealed and i won"
good,"For the most part, employees at Sprouts are happy individuals and are a joy to work with. However, the current store manager is a micro-manager far beyond necessary. Instead of letting his department managers know what he needs of them, he does it all himself and writes them up afterwards for not doing it."
good,I have loved this company from the start. We have had four store managers in one year and thing are constantly changing. It's very hard to keep up with the changes. One week it's this way and next week it is different. I am starting to feel that if things keep going like this the store will be closed in less than two years. They make promises that they don't keep.
good,"Sprouts is an good place to work, the management is not the best, they don't work together."
good,"On a typical day I am bagging groceries, helping customers to their cars, rounding up carts, cleaning bathrooms, and doing store sweeps.  I feel its a great job to start off to show good work ethic but lacks the hours I need to pay for school.  Management one level above tend to have double standards yet store management do a great job.  Co-workers tend to have a great team mentality which makes the work fun.  The hardest part is running around outside in the heat but nothing too difficult, and the physicality makes it fun for me."
good,I enjoy customer service and my co-workers were fun to work with but there isn't much room for advancement.
good,"I worked as a scan coordinator, cashier, floral, grocery, bookkeeping, bagger."
good,Most of the your time is focused on customer service and providing the best possible shopping experience for the customers there while still managing to get production.
good,Fairly good company to work for. I worked for Publix for 4 years and Sprouts started me off at 1.25/ hour more. Little advancement possibilities. Friendly people
good,They are a growing company.  But hard to get store manager with only three stores in town.  It is a great store to get your start in retail that isnt a union.
good,Your only there to work and they don’t care about anything else.Some days are better than others.  Managers talk to you like you are a child. Pay was great
good,"A day on the job at Sprouts meant always being on your feet and never for a moment having an off time, and while that's great for a young adult, it can slowly wear one out over time. I learned how to better pace myself, and know where my limits are, and how to organize my daily work schedule and what I need to focus on at the end of each day and so forth. Management overall had a very open way of communication, and always tried working with days off, however requesting for hours and any extra shifts deemed near impossible, so earning a sufficient amount of money, was never in sight for me. The workplace, was more casual than it was professional between team members, managers and assistant managers had more professionalism, however standard team members would occasionally disregard respect for other coworkers in a work environment, on or off break. The hardest part of the job was dealing with either uncooperative customers or other team members who felt the need to take out their anger upon others in the workforce. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably truly helping customers who were eager to learn, find what they needed and help describe more of what a product could do for them."
good,"It's okay for a temporary job but it's a bit stressful. There's alot to do and the managers aren't organized well enough to make things run smoothly. The store manager gives yours based off favoritism so if you boot lick you'll be fine."
good,"All work can get stressful. But for my experience, sprouts was the most relaxed work environment I got to work at. I've had tons of retail jobs, working at sprouts was the least demanding. They don't care about tattoos either with was a big plus for me!! I would take it back anyday. I had to leave due to family emergency."
good,"Sprouts is a fun place to work if you don't mind spending most of your time in a freezer. I worked in the bakery where everything is frozen and has to thaw overnight. The regular clerks hardly do any baking themselves, just the main baker who comes in at 5am. Bakery clerks do the boxing and thawing of product, as well as constantly making sure the lobby area looks appealing. Very repetitious and boring. Other than the work load, the people were very friendly and it is very easy to move around and/or advance in the company."
good,"Sprouts, is a great company they care about the product they deliver to the community. however, if you're looking for a place that's going to show you they appreciate your quality of work this isn't the place. they don't critique your work or make you feel bad. however, in the mind of management is you can always do better."
good,"Most people I work with seem to enjoy their job most of the time, especially those who have worked at other grocery stores.  I feel the pay is low for the amount of work expected and there is little appreciation for a job well done."
good,"Everyone there is nice, customers are annoying though. They expect you to have no life. Management doesn't inform you about inportant info. Decent pay. Dont get a raise till after you work there for a year"
good,"Sprouts has ALOT of opportunities to advance in the company. But there is also alot to put up with. First, they are not quick to fire people so you will be stuck with awful coworkers until they either no call no show or walk out. Second, being that there is alot of opportunity for promotion; there are under qualified managers. Be prepared to be better at this job then them if you have experience with another grocery company."
good,What i did was work night shift the hardest part would be if there was a big order it would be faster pace but cool place to work all the co workers were also nice people so it was easy to adapt.
good,This company trains staff very well. If you are customer service oriented then its a great fit for you. If you work hard you can move between departments and get more hours. Usually only part time hours and they can range from early morning shifts to late afternoon into closing hours.
good,This was a good first job right out of high school. The managers were pretty laid back and let you get away with a lot as long as you were nice to the customers helped them in any way that you needed and got your duties done for the day.
good,The ideas they have for the company are ideal and motivational.  Training needs fine tuning.  Training should be done by a person that knows how to train and effectively teach rather tnen a person that may just know how to do the jjob.
good,The most enjoyable part of being a vitamin clerk was being able to assist guests and help them out with a product they had no idea about. It was very fun.
good,"Very beneficial position learned a lot about health, had to stock daily and straighten often. I was vitamin clerk so constantly giving health advice. Management for my specific department were great. But store managers didn't know much about my department. The hardest part was trying to stay busy sometimes especially on slow days. The enjoyable part was the discounts"
good,When I 1st started at sprouts I really enjoyed it As time went on I realized how the management does not appreciate its employees. I have been around for a while so I know good vs. bad management
good,working at sprouts farmers market is a great place to work at and mostly the great people you'll meet there are good people and can help you with your work.
good,"Typical day at work involves mostly customer service and having everything full at all times to drive sales for the store!  I learned how to do ordering of items for our department, how to drive sales and how to plan out for a big sale event. Hardest part of the job is when there isnt enough people working in a day and then you have a crowd of people angry because there isnt enough cashiers. Enjoyable part of the job is the co workers you get to meet throughout the days, the benefits and a great manager."
good,"Work was always productive with lots of opportunities for learning new aspects of the job."
good,Sprouts is an easy company to work for. There isn't a lot of room for advancement. The people I work with on the other hand are almost like another family to me. Clients are more upscale and always nice. The job is fairly easy but don't expect too many hours.
good,Sometimes u get a lot of hours. Other times its like 1 time a week. Too unstable. The people there are really nice though. My favorite part is the community.
good,"overall great place to grow. advancement for anyone willing to put time in, and willing to relocate. the company is growing in my area, and i feel they compensate very well."
good,"As far as jobs in the grocery industry go, this was a good company to work for. Managers did a good job establishing a community. Hard work was recognized, and opportunities to move up appeared regularly."
good,"10 hour work days, as a salaried employee."
good,This was a very good experience workplace to work to learn how to eat better and to live healthy. It made me realize that eating healthy make you live longer
good,"I loved my job at Sprouts when I first started. The people I work with are fantastic and easy to be around all day. The work is simple yet challenging and fun to do. Management can be iffy depending on who is running your department. My first manager was incredible and then she left and we got a new manager who was not great, and now my current one is better. It's a hit or miss. But they are incredibly accommodation to scheduling and it was a great job to have while in school because they worked with my school schedule. I was never refused a day off when I needed it. Overall I've been happy here. Wish there were better systems for the departments instead of each store doing their own thing -- it lacks continuity."
good,It was a good palce to stay not longterm job. Its only for highschool college kids. It could be carrer place if things would of workout. But it cut throw there sugar coat to. A bunch of lazy mangers emlpoyess there. I could of been deparment manger there but no inested for me. Had move on get career going. School allthat. Benfits are good there 41k. But the lack of people. Company wants to much to like this this this this this this. They push there emlpoyess a lot do more.
good,The management could use some work but overall job is not bad. Very quick paced and can be stressful at many times and if you can get past being alone and having a lot of work to do you should be good!
good,"Involves maintaining inventory, stocking shelves, assisting customers with questions or concerns and keeping a positive attitude. The customers are always nice, as is the staff. My coworkers are great and communicate very well with each other."
good,"The management was very inconsistent with all the changing managers and supervisors, but the overall experience was very positive besides that."
good,"A typical day is that I would oversee all employee breaks and lunches on the front end. I make night cash deposits after breaking down cashier tills, and open front office to count safe for money deposits."
good,"once they taught me the basics and ran with it, became a single cell unit that they could depend on without fail. Over all they weren't bad, just not organized"
good,Sprouts is a pretty good place to work. It has a friendly environment and management is pretty laid back.
good,I enjoyed my time at sprouts. The employee discount made the job even better.. created friendships and learned about the grocery business. Definitely a good job!
good,"They cut hours without warning, so be prepared to get a second job. Everyone is really friendly though; very few rude customers. However, that's partially because of 'the customer is always right' mentality. "
good,Sprouts is a wonderful company to work for. They allow plenty of room for advancement. Very family oriented atmosphere. Management team is well trained and respectful.
good,"This is a great place to work for those with a lot of hours. Benefits are excellent. You get great healthcare through Blue Cross Blue Shield for only around $80 a month. Dental is also probably good, and everyone gets 401k. I'm not too familiar with all the benefits though, since I have low hours and don't get these great benefits. Those that don't work as many hours are on the low-end of the bargain. Healthcare is not done through Blue Cross but instead through Reliance Standard. I'd rather do Obamacare's cheap plans than Reliance. No dental and I think no vision for low-end workers. Some positions are subject to intense hour cuts (those deemed not very important), especially through the months September to December. At my location management lacks in some areas and customer satisfaction is not at best. Sprouts is not a very great company in some areas, but in few areas, it is. If you want to work here, seek a great high-hour position. Most in these positions are very happy."
good,"I didn't work at Sprouts for to long, but if the pay and benefits were a bit on the brighter side it would have definitely been a bright experience. I gained tons of knowledge on nutrition, produce, the culture of organic, and great customer service. The staff, and customers were beyond friendly. I recommend this job for someone who just graduated from high school, or a part time college student."
good,Pay not at standard people are excellent to work with but people needs to be compensated for great employment goal. Don't like to promote by skills only by popularity.
good,"The typical day at work was mostly consisted of cutting a wide assortment of meats and cheeses, while working at sprouts I learned how to cut meats and cheeses fast and at high quality, also learning about stocking and customer service. the management team was fast paced and dedicated to keeping a friendly and productive work environment, the crew made it a fun and hardworking setting, also keeping things professional. the hardest part of the job was dealing with a short staffed crew, the most enjoyable part was having a friendly hardworking team."
good,"Some managers don't care to stop shoplifters and there is a lot of theft in the vitamins department. Management will help in your department if its absolutely needed but sometimes the company throws too much work on them and they are by themselves for hours at a time so it is hard to get everything done.Good benefits and discounts. Not enough hours, good as a second job. They work with your schedule, education and others commitments is important to them."
good,"working at sprouts was a fun place to work at,meeting great new people,coworkers were ok,management was hard but fair,the hardest part of the job was closing,the enjoyable part meeting new people."
good,Its a great place to work especually if you would like to adcance quickly. The management listen to your concerns and try their best to resolve the situation
good,very good company nice place to work good very fast pace customer  service good cowerkers
good,"It's a great store it just depends on how well, or how much they like you PERSONALLY. No matter how hard your working to improve if they don't care for you, they DON'T NOTICE YOU."
good,The days were usually pretty good. All but one of the managers are nice. There aren't really any typical work days. I met some awesome people that I am still friends with. Most of the people who work there are super helpful.
good,New manager is the most discriminating person I’ve ever worked for!! The company is blind to it and HR protects its mangers not the employees!! Would not wish this toxic environment on my worst enemy.
good,"There have been good days and there have been bad days --- but overall some of their staff members talk too much. I mean if they talk (gossip) about people , their work history and family, than they need to have their own talk show"
good,you learn how to deal with messed up management while doing all the work of managers and other co workers every day even on days off
good,"love the products they sold but hostile work place Inventoried, stored, priced and restocked merchandise displays in retail store. Received, opened, unpacked cartons, crates of merchandise, "
good,management was trash and would rather hire more workers than give hours to their experienced employees just to save money on benefits. I thought it was a great place for students or retirees basically anyone that this job won't be their prime focus because they will be let down
good,You have to take a lunch when working 6 hours or you get a write up. The hard working ones get crapped on and if your doing everything wrong like coming in drunk or high or sexually assaulting women you get promoted. Never work for this company
good,"Its a Farmers Market. Things arent easy but it can be done, theres alot of orders and demands. Work load is plenty enough to exhaust you. Although 24 hr rule is assured unreliable people gains you more hours. Not recognizable for promotion unless youve been there longer."
good,Long hours no appreciation. Management a joke. Want you to do job but yet habe no idea what it is they aski g you to do. The Management at sprouts mostly works on popularity and looks doesnt matter if u eork hard.
good,I originally loved this job and everything about it but as time went along and I kept asking about advancement opportunities I kept getting blown off or ignored and even berated or ridiculed for seeking to grow in a company that I actually enjoyed working in but as I kept working there I was forced to do more and more menial task that weren't part of my job description nor required
good,"At Sprouts Farmers Markets, a typical day would consist of collecting shopping carts from the parking lot, bagging groceries, maintaining the cleanliness of the storefront, and restocking parts of the store.  This is a slow paced job for most of the day with a usual rush around the middle of the day.  The hardest part of this job was how slow paced it is because it was easy to run out of tasks to do."
good,"I was there for almost 1 year. That is the most likely amount of time anyone has worked here. Management is so fluid that you will most likely be working under some that didn't hire you. I also moved during this time and transferred, but the management started to minimize my hours to maybe 8 hrs, one shift each week. That didn't help at all. I talked to management and they said they couldn't do anything. I took school over job, so I left before my year."
good,"Sprouts was originally supposed to be just a high school job for me.  I started when I turned 16 as a bagger and i eventually worked my way up be a grocery clerk when i turned 18.  I graduated high school and I decided to stay and work part time while pursuing school to save money for my future.  I ended up being cross trained in cashiering and then produce as well.  I decided I liked produce so much i asked for it to be my permanent position and they gladly let me.  I met so many good employees but more that twice as many bad employees (just like any retail/grocery job) Most of the managers were good, some were terrible, but it is NOT a career."
good,Management needs to consider that people have to make a living and pay their bills.  The physicality of the job is great for me and helped me get in great shape.
good,"Your typical day at work was bagging groceries or would be getting the carts from the parking lot. Was usually busy around noon and around 5. "
good,"The job is very repetitive, you work the same loads everyday, there is nothing to look forward to. You begin to feel like a zombie doing the same things every time you work, always loading and stocking. The job doesn't take much thinking, which is a big con. You get lost in the motion and you get bored, tired and then want to go home. You have great co-workers though, that's the only good thing."
good,i enjoyed working there and made many friends with co workers and costumers alike. hardest part of the job was retrieving carts due   to minor wrist injury
good,"I enjoyed my work and interacting with the customers but i couldn't stand the management. Everything was always so sloppy and just a cluster. The manger changed my schedule all the time and would make me close and open, but the thing that made me leave was the disrespect from my manager and the little amount of compensation and pay i got from it"
good,"Was a Courtesy Clerk who excelled in providing premier customer service quickly and efficiently in a busy grocery store environment. Skilled in proper bagging, inventory management, and maintaining store layout to corporate standards. Recognized for fast, friendly customer service and flexible work style to complement a team approach to grocery service."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with at sprouts and the hours were very flexible but the pay was only 9 an hour and when I did need more hours they were hard to get
good,"This is a great store, and whats true in life is true in retail. You are only as great as your leaders. And when you have more experience than your managers. It doesn't make for an easy environment."
good,A typical day at work consists of transactions of many quantities. I have learned to memorize the PLU identification numbers to produces items. The workplace environment is average. The hardest part of the job is having to seek out other employees for items not on shelves. Most enjoyable part of the job is listening to music i like while working.
good,"Sprouts is a great company, they make their employees feel appreciated. However, hours are inconsistent. Management is the key to the workplace, from store managers to department managers. If they have a bias and you are not one of the favored, your hours will be cut and your shifts will be hard to get through. This is obviously a store specific quality though. As with every job, management will either make or break you."
good,They would rather promote a man. However they do promote those who sleep with the boss. There is a lot of bad behavior in the upper ranks. Just beware but there are worse places to work
good,"When I first started working here, we were promised 25 hours average for part time workers. and boy did we get that- but only for two weeks. My hours went from 25 hours, to 18/week. They went from 18 to 12. then for a solid 4 months I was only scheduled one day a week for 6 hours. I was barely able to pay my car insurance! I switched to a different department and hours got a little better. But the general management of that store(34) was three star at best. One of them yelled at me in front of customers for something i absolutely did not do. That was the last straw. Regardless of my bad experiences I did like the people who I worked with. They were all so nice and friendly and i'm better for knowing them."
good,"Hate the place, Hate the Management, Hate the inconsistent hours. No one is held accountable for anything which is frustrating for the employees who actually go into work to work"
good,"It's alright working there, not enough hours to maintain single household. They exhibit less cost for healthy living. They make sure you following rules in clocking in/out."
good,me personally as for when i worked there as a cashier i didnt like it cause i worked retail a couple of years out of my life and everything is the same people that work in the front end make fun of customers and talk bad about them and i wasnt the one for that i go in and do my job and go home when my shift is over.
good,The company could be able to provide health insurance to part time employees. make some part time to full time. Not cut hours to where people get like 12 hrs a week.
good,"Working at sprouts I learned how the grocery business works, every man/ woman for themselves. i loved my coworkers they were a lot of fun that's how i got through a lot of my long days there."
good,"I was a cashier and a typical day was just customer service. I learned how to have patience with people who don't speak English, I memorized codes for all fruits and vegetables, and I learned how to read people. The management was lucid and it was hard to move up in the company. Co- workers were generally easy to get along with and mostly helpful. The hardest part of the job was communicating with the people who didn't speak English. My favorite part of the job was knowing that I was a part of the working class and making money to feed my children."
good,"I did learn a lot about food safety from this job and especially about specific products as well. However, I was scheduled over the amount of hours and unfortunately became the reason why I quit because it interfered with my college courses. I cannot say that my experience was similar to other Sprouts stores or delis, but I personally was very stressed by our deli manager in particular."
good,"My management was the biggest issue, it was unstable and had a high turnover. The store manager wasn't flexible enough. The Deli manager wasn't someone suited for the position and would often stress out her employees."
good,"It was a cool job, but the hours were not consistent and the shift sucked (graveyard).  There was a transition going on with management when I arrived there. So it was a little strange not working for the guy that hired me"
good,Great job but extremely poor management. I have no idea why the people in the management positions were there to even begin with. Luckily I love to work so it was a minor inconvenience.
good,"It's a great company to start off, but working there in general it's not worth it. It also depends on the management level it becuause you are not getting enough hours."
good,"Its a great job for people who can handle stress and multitasking at the same time. New programs to make the job easier are becoming more and more effective as we are being trained more and more how to do them and use them to our advantage. Sometimes management can handle situations with a little more respect for employees working to get everything necessary done in a short amount of time, other times, management will jump in and help whenever and wherever needed which is a great boost."
good,"They give routinely objectives for us to complete everyday. It's not that bad, but cleaning bathrooms and putting carts away can get pretty hectic sometimes."
good,The customers are the greatest.  And most of the employees are real easy to work with.  The managers are really knowledgeable.   The deli is fantastic.  Working there made my work day go by really fast. It is just a really good feeling that you can help maintain  a place for people to eat and live healthier.
good,They wouldn't allow me to days off for school. I eventually ended up leaving to attend school full time. They also just treat employees unfairly. Prob
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to help people. I gained experience in customer service while working for Sprouts. The hardest part was collecting all of the carts, but over all it was a simple job."
good,Love the job and everything about it except the employees!!  Great store manager bad second manager he don't know how to speak with his employees. New employees lazy.
good,"The employees expectations are high"
good,I had problems with them working with my schedule as I had 2 jobs at the time. They would schedule me when I told them I was working at my other job and then get mad when I told them I wouldn't be able to come in.
good,"the staff are overall very energetic and happy"
good,"did enjoy working there, but did not like how they didn't care for my school schedule at all which made it difficult, due to the fact of me constantly having to switch schedules."
good,"great people to work with, but there can be some drama around the store. at the same time, the employees there know how to confront each other in a respectable manner, and solve most complications."
good,"lack of training, but understanding when asking questions. lower level managers very helpful. higher level management not very responsive to any suggestions of ways to improve the quality of workers"
good,"A typical day at sprouts includes checking the front end reports and assisting customers along with managing the cashiers breaks/lunches. The management team is very friendly and helpful with assisting all customers and team members. I've learned how to supervise individuals, report post office sales into a ' point of sale"" system and balance tills. Most of my co workers work in multiple departments so it is very easy to ask for help. The most enjoyable part is array of different people sprouts hires."
good,I loved working at sprouts but was not being given full time hours like I had asked for multiple times. Was not making a livable wage.
good,"Imagine working in a grocery store.....but for health freaks that need your help, but they really don't need your help."
good,"Overall it was probably one of the most mismanaged places that I ever worked for but what kept me coming back was the people, they had a great deal of good people working there, just was ran terribly."
good,"Love working here when certain management is there, but barely get any hours even for my position and I live paycheck to paycheck and those paychecks are not big. Should be getting paid more but with the way this company works, less hours is better for them no matter who it's hurting."
good,"It was like any other place of work, some days are good and some are not but you need to make the best of it."
good,"The fellow employees are wonderful to work with, the management is a mixed bag. Management is known to play games and favorites so always watch your back with them.  Especially the store managers, they tend to switch stores every couple of months because of their poor work and want to prove themselves by busting your butt.  Besides that its an easy job."
good,"I enjoy meeting new people and interacting with them. I can assist customers in finding the products they are looking for, making suggestions or recommendations."
good,The People you work with make it easier some days then there are the few that have been there so long they don`t care if they get anything done because the harder workers will always pick up after them. some customers are super nice and great to help but then you have some that are just rude for no reason
good,I ultimately applied for the West Hollywood CA location for the same position and I when I got that interview I was then told to apply for the Greensboro NC location I did an was made an offer. The sad part is this store doesn't get a lot of business which puts a damper on my wallet. Hopefully business will pick up soon.
good,Worked over night as a grocery assistant. It was good if we didn’t have too many call offs. Call offs were constant. I sometimes would be the only person to have keys to the front doors to unlock for incoming associates. The pay was good but the workload was heavy.
good,Friendly coworkers. Lady that works in Office very rude. Close to a year working there spoke with management a few times asked for a place to grow keeps giving me the run around and never falls through on what they say
good,company is moving in a great direction. might be too fast though. no sense of job security. they do make the environment great and friendly. love it there
good,"I worked at one store and had three different head managers during my time there. The mood of the place was consistently shifting as was performance. That said, some stores, I've heard, are better to work at then others and I think that boils down to the market and the manager. They're growing quick and they can only do that by skimming a little off the top on wages. They don't pay as much as they could/should."
good,"fun , relaxed, fast-paced work environment, but pay was not very good. a lot of drama and management is pretty unprofessional. Probably one of the better grocery store chains to work for though"
good,I learned a lot working here cause of the type of grocery store. This is store specializes in organic and good for you foods. The way the work together to get the job done taught me a lot.
good,There is obvious favoritism especially if they are related to management. A girl from the scan office got her brother in as a cashier he would get so many hours and more pay then everyone that they would send us home early so he may hit his 40
good,"It was a very fun job with easy tasks. The hours were not bad at all. If you were just a simple floor member that put out produce the earliest you needed to be there is 7am. The best thing about the job is you get paid weekly. Another great thing is you were allotted 2 paid 15 minute breaks as well as a 30 minute unpaid break if you worked a full 8 hour shift. So essentially you got to relax every two hours - give or take. The worst thing about it was probably the heavy lifting, but that was even manageable."
good,"horrible management, lack of communication,  low pay rates, expected to do jobs your not being paid for, lack of room for growth, team members not so great"
good,Sprouts is new and exciting and a fun place to work. If you can get past the kinks in the system and learn to love your job and have fun with the people you work with its great.
good,I enjoyed working front cashier. Friendly team members and helpful manger. Interactive with diversity of people. Cash register & produce scale was simple and easy to operate.
good,"Sprouts Farmers Market is a good place to work if you have any piercings/colored hair, the people are friendly and overall big on teamwork. My coworkers make the job enjoyable for me."
good,"Each day was a rush, you were expected to preform at your max for your entire shift. Management was a bit biased on who they would let advance in the work place, you just had to be on their good side. It was fun to work with the coworkers but the duties put a lot of stress on the body, leaving you sore till the next day."
good,Fun work place with good values.  Very relaxed and understanding.  Sometimes managers lack knowledge.  Wages are not always fair.  No overtime is allowed.  Hours for the following work week are based on last weeks sales.  Hours can be inconsistent.
good,"The leader in Natural foods stores in the area, the shining stars at Sprouts Farmers Markets are the people who work for the company. The longer the staff have committed to Sprouts, the more loyal they seem to be. I have come to develop close relationships with the people I grew to know as my second family. They are dedicated to educating themselves and their staff (if they are in management) and they are loyal to the company they have dedicated their time to. The problems lie within the exponential growth that Sprouts has encountered. It's no surprise that in business, the larger a company gets, the smaller its culture grows. Sprouts has put a chokehold on the culture it once prided itself on. The staff is overworked and undercompensated for the time they put into the company. When the company went public a few years ago, no one in management was offered stock. Those who were offered stock were in upper management, already making triple digit annual salaries. In the time that I worked there, the company had switched from a passionate, risk taking CEO who was grateful for every employee to one who came from an accounting background and was more focused on a better bottom line for the company. Though a better bottom line is ideal for any business, a lot of employees felt as if they were treated more like money makers than people. The turnover rate is high and the company is trying to figure out how to get back to their roots while meeting financial goals. "
good,"Loved my coworkers, benefits are an option given to everyone whos manager but not regular employees unless you work 40 hours I believe. Won't get overtime so don't ask for it, you do get a discount card and the food there is good."
good,"working here is tough mentally as management would rather have perfect conditions than see a shopped department. but complain about load being left undone if you take time to freshen the department. been with department for 4 years and all of my wage raises have come with minimum wage law increase as apposed to being graded fairly and given a proper raise. refer a friend program is bogus, got 2 friends in way past 90 day and still no compensation, and those 2 friends make 3 more bucks than i do on the hour. just frustrating to see such a good company lose focus on the good workers and promote underqualified people to save hard workers in the bottem tier."
good,Solid teamwork and expectations clearly communicated.  Customer service/interaction are required. It's obvious that you are working in a non-union operation.
good,"And I accomplished that goal. Lots of learning opportunity and samples if you work in vitamins. Pay stinks, I thought of it as a paid internship as I got a free education in natural health and vitamins. Just be prepared for people to assume you are a doctor, solicit free medical advice, and expect you to listen to their life stories, haha."
good,"Nice place to work. I appreciate the store manager giving me more than one opportunity for employment. I appreciate the store manager finding other work for me to do within the store, so that I could get more hours on my paycheck."
good,"very busy location and huge turnover, working there has taught , me the ins and outs of a meat department and shown me what its really like behind the doors"
good,Overall a good place to work.  Just don't always want to move you around to other positions though. They seem to place more men in higher positions than women.
good,"The location I work for has a few people that are terribly hard to get along with, but times are tough and you have to force yourself to get along with people even if they make life rough. Overall, it's a good company if you keep top yourself"
good,"Great place to work, excellent environment would go back except they no longer promote within now only outside of store and don't give enough hours. You do get a great discount though."
good,"This work environment can be fun, engaging, and rewarding depending on which store and which manager you work under. Unfortunately, that may be hard to tell until you get on board and observe for awhile."
good,"A typical day at work was usually dreaded"
good,"Sprouts Farmers market is a fun place to work in, Advancement at the location I was stationed was very stagnant. Company is very friendly and very ""Laid Back""."
good,"Sprouts is a great to work, time management is key in retail and is learned quickly. The hardest part of the job is doing double the work load when an employee ""calls out"". The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing happiness on the customers' faces when they're pleased with the output of your job."
good,"Sprouts, so far, has been very different than what I'm used to, and though it doesn't meet my needs for me to continue the quality of life that I'm used to, the people there are pleasant to work with, willing to help a new employee get their bearings, and seem to genuinely care about their associate and customer base."
good,"A day at First Med & Wellness Center appeared fun and enjoyable, greeting customers and answering product questions made it worthwhile."
good,"If you've been in the grocery industry for many years, that its a great place to work. If your young and this is your first job, its a great place to work because they are very flexible."
good,"My review is a bit complicated than others seeing how i worked there when it was Sunflower Market and got god fathered in when it became Sprouts. Awesome place to work at, loved it with all my heart but when Sprouts took over it was starting to take a turn downwards. Since then I have seen many workers who have been there for years leave and new ones that keep rotating in and out since."
good,Good place to work but it has its in and outs. Food you can't find anywhere else. Best sandwiches I've ever tasted. Management is terrible. They don't treat everyone the same. There are a lot of clicks through out the store.
good,The woman who was responsible for the short term disability was always on personal phone calls and not very responsive to the employees. Some of the employees who called in thought she was dead since she refused to return their calls. She hung out with the Presidents Admin Asst. all day and left the bulk of the work to be completed by the Benefits Coordinator. The man who was over her was no better he treated the employees deplorably. I would not recommend working in this department at all. It's shame since this is the Human Resources Department.
good," Would like to have the opportunity for a better work, life balance and advancement."
good,"had a great time working there, but when they turned corp. they lost alot of good people its fun a fun place to work depending on management. micro management all the way from most store directors"
good,"Conflicting schedule , tolls and the drive wasn't working out for me. Sprouts is a great company but the store I was working at was an inconvenience to me, I tried to transfer but it didn't happen."
good,"Sprouts Farmers Market was my first job and it was a good experience engaging at a personal level with shoppers in the produce department. Duties involved replenishing produce tables, helping customers locate and select the best produce available."
good,"Nice atmosphere, this should only be to supplement your income, 10-15 hours maximum given weekly. This could be for retired, veterans, or a stepping stone for high school or someone entering the customer service workforce."
good,I currently worked with a small cleaning company that was hired by sprouts its a great place and environment just not to settle with cleaning company at all.
good,"Working would most often be busy and productive, almost always enjoyable. Scheduling was hectic and requesting specific days/times off was difficult at times."
good,"It was a good experience to work at Sprouts Farmers Market. a schedule was flexible, good people. I enjoyed helping, educated people as a vitamin clerk."
good,Not the most glamorous of jobs but it pays bills and has natural lighting through most parts of the store. Coworkers are typically friendly and customers are not the worst clients to work with. Management is pretty good and hours are flexible.
good,"Working in sprouts has been good for 2 years, great and friendly coworkers  as well as there flexibility; however hours can be cut from 30 to 4 hours a week, it’s difficult to move up to a higher position and wages can only go far in cents. It can be stressful in busy days due to lack of courtesy clerks and cashiers. It’s a good job to start with for work experience but recommend to seek employment somewhere else of your a courtesy clerk after 6 months to a year"
good,"My store is great, but they need better mangers. I’m mainly a grocery clerk but I have also been working in 3 other departments and I am not being paid those departments wages. They expect to pile your Work load with work that is not in your job description and also expect you to finish it within the hours you were scheduled- they hate giving employees overtime because that messes up the managers bonuses. The managers give poor-working employees excuses on why the job was not done. Mangers don’t value their hard working employees which makes the good working employees quit. Sprouts is okay with the high volume of turnovers because they do not want to pay well to keep good employees. The managers don’t hold anyone accountable."
good,I enjoy working at Sprouts Farmer's Market. I have been able to have new experiences by working in different departments which allows me to learn new skills.
good,"I loved working at Sprouts! You get a 15% discount on all purchases - so that's pretty cool! Management is down to earth and employees are an ease to work with."
good,"Not much accountability for late/call-outs, etc. Management tends to play favorites. Some employees get away with being lazy while others are micro managed"
good,"The deli is easily the busiest department in the store. I was lucky enough to have a hard working team and a lot of food service experience. You have a lot of responsibilities from cooking rotisserie chicken to prepping all the store brand cheeses, deli meats, ready made meals, etc, to preparing sandwiches and wraps for customers to making drinks and coffees."
good,"They have good programs set in place, and they do value the customers opinions and meet great customer service standards. Working there is different, there are alot of tightly micro managed changes that happen every week and although you may not have the people for the job, or you may not have the available hours to get the job done that they request, or if someone quits or calls in, they dont care. If the job doesnt get done there are consequences, or everyone above you will only think of the bad you did and not the good, Its just not good enough, was a phrase i heard WAY too many times."
good,"In my lengthy term at Sprouts Farmers Market, I was multi-trained and acquired so many different positions with little to no time and had the opportunity to grow! It was my first job, and I loved working there. Unfortunately I was being paid the same as the employees, being in management positions and had to work crazy hours due to lack of beneficial scheduling/staff on duty. "
good,"Sprouts is an excellent place to work and our manager is excellent..  Training is available to whatever part of the store you are interested in.  They are open to hiring different ages,."
good,Store is wonderful to work for but when you get different manager and do not know what he is doing that is bad. I like it because the staff is great and the discounts are good.  You get days you want off and you get holiday pay part time people accumulate sick time and vactaion
good,"I am a re-hire with Sprouts, and worked in management before this part time position. In general, I have always liked my co-workers at every store, and felt welcome there. My current department manager is stellar, and the store manager is a big support to the department. The benefits are good, yet the pay for clerks is a bit on the low side, for retail. I made a good wage as a manager but simply cannot handle the number of hours required, at this time. "
good,"Typical day of work was cashiering, greeting customers and assisting as needed."
good,"Just another retail company.... new management every few months, usually don't know what they're talking about. Most employees are depressed and fed up with it but don't have the option to quit. However, for me working in produce, it was a pretty sweet gig. Customers could be annoying, but I would send them to harass the front end people if they were bothering me. Depending on the department you work in, it can be a pretty laid back environment. Not something I'd make a career out of but great to just coast for a while. I got promoted within 6 months."
good,"sign onto your assigned lane after a produce walk and get started checking out customers. You will deal with many different types of people, everyone has different shopping methods and you must work with them to get them out of those doors with little to no issues.There will be tough customers who won't care about your feelings and or how another customer made you feel. Every new customer is new opportunity. The most enjoyable part is the nice customers that do come along, who extend their kindness and stories."
good,had good employees and ran semi smoothly. had little opportunity for advancement. had few workers in departments and left a lot of duties put into single workers.
good,I slowly realized that people were leaving because of poor management. I like the staff and customers are amazing there. But the management is just very unprofessional at times
good,I enjoyed working here. Fun environment.  Customers were great and friendly.  Put the management was poor. And the training should be better. It was a job that paid my bills.
good,It was a great company and great job to start off with. management is good but corporate is a bit clueless of store level issues. Hour cuts are frequent. If you work hard you will get rewarded. You will have to work if not this is not job for you
good,"Customers are usually very polite and coworkers get along. Managers are knowledgeable and the 10 percent discount is pretty great. Watch out for the deli, some of them dont put much effort into making a sandwich"
good,Days are eventful! This job produces little stress even in my own position as a full-time student. Management is reasonable for the most part since hours were flexible.
good,"Sprouts opens at 7 am and closes at 10 pm, so the hours can be unpredictable. While management tries to give you a full 40-hr week, it's not always manageable. It's also hard to move up in the company because they love to hire from outside."
good,"The managers and workload are fair.  As long as you have a good attitude and do your best, everyone will be happy. Almost everyone is friendly and easy to work with."
good,Nice people. Stupid rules. Great discounts and job security. Organized and great healthy policies and practices. Lots of training available. Good for part time.
good,fast pace work enviroment that focus on healthy eating pratices.merchandise plans are always changing.its has one of the highest food ethics .you are constantly helping run a register because of not eneough help at the front end.
good,"Overall its a good company, just understaffed overnight, you'll have to work much harder than you should. Good vibes in the store.Nice coworkers to work with."
good,"Sprouts is all about health--vitamins, gluten and dairy free, you name it. 45% of the store is produce. It really does have products from all over the world and customers, too. The racial, age and lifestyle variety makes it a great place to shop. Working there is alright if you can get a desirable position, but training is severely lacking. Any new hire has to really push to get all the training they need for their job."
good,listening to anything said in this review would be contempt prior to investigation anyways. i am required to type this review to use this service. that is all.
good,I only worked for the company for a few months. The building I was in provided very poor training. There was very little punishment or recognition for good performance. The majority of my coworkers were respectful and pleasant. Most managers were willing to answer whatever questions you had. A lot of opportunity for advancement if you stuck it out through the grunt level work. The employee discount was very nice.
good,Pretty simple job requirements.  Does require constant walking and lifting but pays very well. Didn't receive much hours at this location and don't offer student leave.
good,"A typical day working at Sprouts for me included sweeping the aisles in the store and bringing shopping carts back inside from the parking lot. Most importantly, it included being the last face that the customers see as they leave the store. I was there to bag their groceries for them and send them out with a smile, thanking them for choosing Sprouts Farmer's Market."
good,Great people to work with. Flexible hours but hours were cut. The store opened with 50 employees and when i left it was about 30 or less (skeleton crew). The expectation of doing something in 4 hours was same as 8 hour shift. The fun job became stressful and the pay was no longer with it. i love to shop there though!
good,I enjoyed that each shift for every position had a to do list to follow for the day. This allowed me to stay on track and have the people before my shift as well as everyone in the store be more accountable.
good,This job was one of my favorites. I worked in the Vitamin department and learned a ton of information. Very understanding and worked with my schedule as much as they could.
good,it is full or green life! The people there are kind the employees are great - just do you job and be happy and it is all smooth sailing. everything is kept organized so ore time fore the customers.
good,"I would definitely recommend sprouts to someone looking for a job that can maintain steady income and work hours. The work environment is very political, if you want to succeed you have to be close to the managers socially."
good,"It's very easy to get involved right away.  Mistakes are considered a part of learning and are usually not condemned.  Positivity is highly encouraged.  The most difficult part of the job, aside from the physical labor involved, is dealing with unhappy customers or co-workers, but this was rare.  The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing you could make a difference at the store and helping others when they need it."
good,sprouts is a very nice and open grocery store layout. the customer and work base is very nice and friendly. as a bagger you have to sweep the store and get carts from the outside as well as bag customers items.
good,a solid part time job with fluctuation in weekly hours. i would recommend to a person who desires to be paid on a weekly basis. i would not recommend to a person who desires stability.
good,"A fast paced environment with a lot of expansion from sister companies. Big store with multiple selections to choose from with a variety of products; health, bulk, fresh, etc."
good,"Just your basic grocery store job. I was a bagger for most of the day. While at times, I was asked to help with rounding up the shopping carts. Pretty standard stuff."
good,It is a great store to shop for people who are considering a diet and its also located in a great city as well surrounded by other shopping centers that are near.
good,"The city that I reside in has a low cost of living, and there are only two sprouts because it is the home town to a very large Texas grocery company that is very hard to compete with.  So, the advancement opportunities are very limited.  Hours are cut if sales are not coming through the door, and training has been limited because of the change in management every so often.  I am concerned about my future with this company as they seem to move very slowly, and if you are not in the ""click"" of the management team, you are on the outside."
good,A grocery store is always gonna be fast paced and being able to keep up with an ever-changing environment is important. fun to work because I am a very active person but hours were very inconsistent
good,"Lots of walking as a courtesy, I wouldn't want to leave if management hadn't changed so much. "
good,Can be a stressful place to work if not use to being busy all the time. lots of customer service. Everyone is really nice. The hardest part of the job is having management listening to ideas to help the company.
good,"Some days were busier than others. "
good,"The upper and middle management are great. One or two lower-tier managers could be better, but it's not a dealbreaker. The hours are good, the pay could be better, but it's not bad. Mostly, it's incredibly difficult to get time off, request days off, or otherwise get one's schedule adjusted. Plus, lower positions require one to work there for a year before benefits can be attained."
good,Lots of internal growth for hard working employees. Fast paced. Rapidly growing company. A diverse and exciting environment to thrive in. The store sizes are just right and not overwhelmingly large like most grocery stores. Anthony Garner & Tom Bracken are two of the best Store Directors in Las Vegas! A willingness to be cross trained is a great way to open up doors of opportunity.
good,Its a stressful job to be honest. When you get used to what you need to do then you will be straight. The hardest part of the job is learning EVERYTHING IN SPROUTS.Overall i like it the people are cool. Don't make friends there because some are FAKE.
good,"Sprouts is a rewarding but tough work place. I learned how to operate all things in the deli and bakery department which was my job description. I learned how to improve my work ethics with my pace and time management tremendously because there is so much to do in so little time. Management was a downfall while i was there, had a harassment issue that was never addressed which caused me to have to quit my job which was very unfortunate for me. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning all the new things the job called for and actually enjoying my job and coworkers. Insurance was only offered to people that were promoted to senior deli clerk even if you worked 40+ hours a week."
good,Have had wonderful experiences with customers and employees. The communication between employees and management is terrible and are treated as if the employees are robotic and only live to be a worker for sprouts.
good,"Balancing money in the safe, count and balance cashier drawers. Order money if needed. Invoice/code receiving invoices, file. Make change for cashiers. Scan labels,laminate and place on products. Inventory control, receiving vendors. Back up for floral department."
good,"Simple tasks in a fast-pace environment. Provides the opportunity to meet many people, and gain work experience. Courtesy Clerks start off at $9 hourly."
good,the store is great to work for the only problem is the management has gone down for the past few years and has gotten bad about scheduling and listening for when you have to ask for time off
good,"Overall I loved working here, I am currently employed with sprouts and it was a hard decision to make a change in employers but I am just not getting enough hours and I am looking for a company I can grow with which seems difficult to do at Sprouts."
good,"Sprouts was a decent job for a high school student. Hours and schedule were flexible."
good,"A typical day at work was clocking in and then going directly to cash register to assist customers. I learned to memorize produce codes quickly and communicated effectively. Management was under-average and did know to how to communicate effectively. Some co-workers were very helpful and friendly and others were always in a negative mood. Hardest part of the job was doing three jobs at once, such as janitorial duties, courtesy clerk duties, and cashier duties. The most enjoyable part was the breaks and clocking out."
good,"A typical day I would start pulling out of code dates, I would then start to stock shelves with fresh produce. "
good,"Working for the company is fun. I've met a lot of cool people and the company itself have great benefits and pay. As for the current management personnel, they leave A LOT to be desired."
good,Culver City Sprouts is the busiest store in Los Angeles. Its regularly attended by well off celebs or entertainment official which is cool. The co workers are mostly friendly. Management could be better but it works. Schedule adjustments seem available when logical.
good,Sprouts is a great place to work if your young and looking to get your foot in the door in the work force.  I wouldn't recommend working there to make ends meet though.  The hours are not always consistent.
good,My days started at 5 am to beat the heat and we would usually get threw one to two roofs a day. It would be me and my supervisor and he would tell me what material I would need to bring up to the roofs. we would power wash the roofs and then lay the coating then do a second coat and then we would patch holes that were to big.
good,"Sprouts was a fun work place to be in. all the employees are friendly and they have great respect for each other. not often would I complain about fellow clerks. communication was lacking from management and most often showed their dislike or unhappiness with the company, making working with them difficult. however their employees were bright and hard workers."
good,"Check and complete production schedule. Take care of others. Close."
good,A typical day at Sprouts can be very stressful if you are not use to working fast and completing your duties in a timely matter. You are always learning new things on a daily basis. Customer Service is the number one priority in the store so ensuring that are customers are happy and willing to return. Management does provide the opportunity to advance to another dept if wanted as long as the work ethic is there. My co-workers are all nice and friendly they all work great as a team to get tasks completed. I don't really find my job hard i actually love what i do although i am looking to advance and explore my opportunity as my own Administrative Coordinator.I love learning new things i catch on very quickly and carry on the way i was taught to teach any one who would like to learn something that they don't know.
good,"I have the support from my team to perform my duties, enjoy going to work am able to use my experience and knowledge to perform to my duties"
good,Great place to work consistent/plenty of work! Good opportunity to build resume references network learn eat great at discount cool co workers EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER
good,"Always busy. Loved it costumers were great employees did great. Being a manager there really taught me a lot. My communicating skills improved so much, also my ability to multitask improve."
good,"This is a great place to work and would have been a career choice for me. Due to the overhiring practice with opening a new store, I like many others there, am reduced in hours greatly and must find employment elsewhere. I have skills that allow me to find other options and so I am."
good,"Fun work environment, challenging and exciting. I enjoy my job and take pride in my work everyday. I have learned to manage other individuals who work with me and guide them throughout the day."
good,On a daily basis you did the same thing day in and day out. The management team is inexperienced at best. Hours are not really guaranteed even if you are hired full time. I have actually learned alot about healthcare products while working here. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to take breaks and most the customers are very nice.
good,I enjoyed going to work and meeting new people. I got along with everyone I worked with. I enjoyed learning about the different depts.
good,"Check customers out at register, assist people in there shopping needs.  Great people to work with, pretty laid back place."
good,"A typical day at work.  Learning experience was pretty much basic for me.  I did have previous bakery clerk experience so I knew what to expect."
good,"While working at Sprouts, every day was a new and different experience. At times when things seemed a little challenging, teamwork was never an issue. Everybody always made sure to communicate with each other, and help each other out when in need. The managers were very friendly, making us all laugh, and never playing favorites. The hardest part of the job was dealing closing the store at night, only because there was a lot of work to be done in a short amount of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that even on the harder days; for example if someone calls in causing a short staff, there was always someone else willing to leave their own department to help you get your work done on time."
good,"great with providing hours, corporate is not very helpful. great for a summer job."
good,"The environment is good, many friendly employees and customers. High volume of customers, plenty of work to do. Time goes by really fast"
good,"With this being a new store, management is very rigid."
good,"This was one of my favorite jobs I have ever worked."
good,"Typical day at work was pretty easy. I learned exceptional customer service skills, and the company itself has a great set of core values. I was a front end manager at one point and got to learn how to manage fellow employees as well as disgruntled customers. The hardest part of working here is, however, the disgruntled customers. Management is good, my store manager is one of the most hardworking people I know. I have worked for this company for five years, and I can't complain too much."
good,"They're great. I learned I could be a great cashier and have a wonderful clientele. Co workers were definitely in team spirit and if you pull your weight and keep your head up at the right times, you got it going for ya, cake walk."
good,"Sprouts Farmers Market is a company with high focus on growth. Employees are exposed to a large amount of experiences early on as the job is ever-changing. Employees must be adaptable, and open to constant change and developments."
good,Very busy oriented day with a lot of traffic flow. I have learned that there is so many different ways that I can use my experience in different levels of the store. My co-workers are like family for me they are what makes the company what it is and that is successful. The hardest part of my job is telling a customer no when we are all part of saying yes to the customer. The most enjoyable part of my job is doing my daily procedures and challenging myself on a daily basis.
good,"Not a company I would recommend, the company feels like a startup, woefully behind in technology, if your in management they don't care about work life balance, there solution is to just deal with it."
good,A typical day at work for me includes a lot of smiles; a lot of laughter between customer and employee. Every one is usually happy. We just desire a higher pay rate.
good,"I would still be at Sprouts had my manager fully investigated my concerns and the department manager cared about the team as much as she cared about her ego. She was messy, unorganized and did absolutely no work. She spent most of her time in the back office on Facebook, Facetiming her daughter and sitting in her car listening to music. When she was on the sales floor, she spent it flipping her blond hair to gain attention from male employees and customers. She was consistently an hour or more late or called out."
good,"There is little or no advancement when working part time."
good,it was ok u can advance fast if your good at your job. Pay was ok but I never got a pay raise like I thought I would get every year I only got a pay raise because I was promoted
good,"I've worked at two different Sprout's grocery stores and my experience has been simply adequate. I have been promoted about every six months which has been great but even with the promotions the pay is still not great. As for store management, it seems as if they are always breathing down your neck. I understand that upper management's focus is to always improve the store and profits but it is usually excessive. Regional managers come in often and tell you areas where your department is lacking but then refuse to give you the resources such as staff, hours, or time to correct it. Would recommend using this company as a stepping stone and not a career."
good,The two positions I held were fun. Working as a courtesy clerk was pleasant because you could lose yourself in your head while you worked. It was entirely manual labor and didn't require much critical thinking. My position as Backup Assistant Scan Coordinator was/is fun because you would get out of work by noon-time as everyone else was beginning their midshifts.
good,"The workers are always very friendly and positive. This made the job much more enjoyable. The only thing, was that there wasn't enough for me to do. There was too much down time."
good,"Sprouts is a job that I could see myself working at for the rest of my life. The benefits are great, and the work itself was always the right amount of challenging."
good,You have to experience yourself to accurately get an understanding of working at Sprouts.  It depends on your value of self worth and determination in order to gain from working at Sprouts.
good,"Being a team member at Sprouts gave me the opportunity to learn about the retail grocery industry.  I also improved upon my computer skills and management skills.  My day started very early, which was sometimes difficult, but I enjoyed the team members that I worked with."
good,I like to work in sprouts. people are so friendly and helpful over there.it is a fast growing and busy company. management is good too. I didn't found any hard part for me .i learned how to deal with customers and also how to operate front end equipment.
good,"I was able to run across a lot of people, but the hours are short and I barley maid 300 in a week, and if they don't like you your never get any hours."
good,I take care of Boars head meat department and that includes cutting the meat and cheese for the customers. I had never worked in a deli before and so I was trained on all the machines on how to work them and clean them. The workplace is relaxed and mostly enjoyable. there is the occasional customer who gets upset that needs help. I enjoy the customer service.
good,It was fun to work at Sprouts i enjoyed my fellow employees and the people who came to the store where nice and i enjoyed being able to find people what they were looking for.
good,Some managers play favorite s but not all of them its a great company to work for. Great benefits and 401k plans. The customer s are friendly. The company also treates the employees well
good,"I worked at 2 different sprouts. One worked like a well-oiled machine, the other one was frustrating every day. Working at sprouts isn't as much corporate nonsense as a place like King Soopers and if you have any retail experience it is not that difficult a job."
good,"The place was a great place to work. It was fun and we had only few things to do, but they were plentiful. They would give us around 15 minute breaks but we could do anything we wanted to in those 15 minutes"
good,"Loved meeting new customers even employees."
good,"Management tends to be difficult to work with, tough on employees, and not understanding of work conditions. Pay is unfair for work load expected and benefits aren’t great unless you are in a management level position. Regardless, customers can be rude at times but overall are very friendly and easy to work with. Coworkers are nice, smart, and charming and you almost always build close relationships with them easily. In addition, Sprouts provides weekly pay and 15% off store discount."
good,"As a courtesy clerk, a typical day will entail bagging customers' items,  sweeping the floors, collecting carts from the parking lot, making sure the restrooms are stocked, and putting returned items back. The management was overall decent. The workplace culture is friendly and kind. Hardest part of the job is when the store is extremely busy and there are either not enough courtesy clerks to both bag items and collect carts from the parking lot. The most enjoyable part is downtime when you get to talk with coworkers."
good,"I learned a lot it was one of my first jobs. I learned how to stock shelves count merchandise, work the cash registers, work the mop machine, and unload the trucks."
good,"a good place to pick up many skill sets and develop confidence in those skills, especially for those right out of high school who need that foundation."
good,"Sprouts is a great company to work for however, the regional managment team seams more focused on their own positions in the company instead of providing a better work environment and incentives for employees."
good,"As a sprouts cashier, my tasks were most usually simple, consistent and coordinated. A smile, a good attitude, and a strong practiced patience will keep you this job with ease."
good,I really enjoyed working here. It was fast paced and I enjoyed working with a team and the employees there.I would go back to work for this company if given the opportunity.
good,"Great job but between the rumor mill and management's poor choices, it constantly felt like things weren't getting done due to someone being upset. other than that, it was a good place."
good,"The Workplace is okay but management is not really open to hear new ideas."
good,"Work well with college students and it’s rewarding. The management is nice as well, very understanding and tries their best to compensate when life gets in the way"
good,"I like working here, but I dont see this as my future career. It can get stressful at times because it may be short staffed but it is a great company ro start as tour first job!"
good,"Sprouts is a good fast paced work environment.."
good,"Working for Sprouts is like working for many other grocery stores, but the benefits are better, and you get them faster than working at a Union Shop.  Also, the pay was better, but they changed that in 2018 and it is now a much lower paying grocery store, which is tragic."
good,"Sprouts is always trying to improve the work environment and schedule. There is staff training, special events, employee discounts and vacation benefits."
good,"I have been working for Sprouts for just under a year and have seen so many associates come and go due to poor management. While a few of these people were bad apples most were hard-working team players that were under-appreciated and overlooked for promotions. The problems are systemic with the problems starting at the top. I recently heard at a meeting that our turnover rate is hovering around 76%, though I don't know if this number reflects the company as a whole or only my store."
good,My basic routine is refilling all the bins with the labeled merchandise with consistent inventory as well as the stock room inventory. Every other day we'd unload pallets of our low merchandise. Having a positive attitude can have an up lifting attitude towards other associates. The hardest part of the job would be keeping track of inventory and the most enjoyable part is working well with others that reflect on a great attitude.
good,its a very good place and great environment to work for teenagers and students to get some work experience and the same time having a small source of income
good,"Sprouts is definitely a great grocery store with a beautiful layout. From the happiness being passed around between employees and managers it really is a tough establishment to critique. As a Dairy Manager, Grocery Assistant, Receiver,  and Meat department employee the jobs obviously differed, but the moral was still the same. My typical day would be to clock in and go straight away to my department to get started ASAP. Grocery is always busy, so time usually isn't wasted. Working back stock into code checking, while making sure everything is pulled forward in a timely manner as you order for new product to come in the next day. Followed up by load throwing for my next 8 hour shift to rinse and repeat. Every Wednesday as department heads you would create a schedule for your employees in regards to what fits best for your departments needs. Also, on top of those actives we would have huddles between 9-10 am, and 3 pm everyday for daily recap. Strongly recommend a career here.  I built myself through Sprouts grasping the hands on experience of retail allowing me to live and breathe the challenges out in this industry, and to define the opportunities I wish to pursue in my life."
good,Great company to work for if flexibility suits you. Hours are also flexible.  Great work environment and also great customer too. Many shoppers love shopping at sprouts for healthy living is for less.
good,Was okay. The hour were okay didn't give a lot of hours to the us. The people there were great. Just the hours and the pay did not match up at all. If you need a job it's a job
good,Sprouts was a great company to work for.  They are driven for excellence and are passionate about Healthy Living for Less!  Company is growing big time and moving into East Coast.  Best of Luck!
good,"Pretty relaxed environment, have to be fast on the register in order to get hours every week, paid every week which is nice."
good,"Sprouts, was a good environment for retail work, (produce in my case).  If your comfortable with retail customer service, not afraid of working hard and comfortable with adaptation for customers, then Sprouts is a job for some.  Expect, large projections from managment with some impossible tasks.  Sprouts is working on better team work throughout all departments.  Benifits are not bad but retail pay remains under retail grocery companies agreement of holding to specific pay caps.  Most employees are part-time workers and rarely hire Full-time.  Loved the team effort when under good management."
good,Working at sprouts in the bulk department is hard work. Its very demanding on your body. The best part is the relationships that you make with the other associates and the customers especially.
good,"Wonderful, friendly team oriented co-workers, supportive management, great store products, great customers,   Everyone really does work together to make it a great store and easy to get along with each other."
good,"Depending on the day it was a mostly enjoyable experience. The crew that I work with are decent working people, and my job duties aren't that difficult."
good,"Good company, good place to start.   The workplace is safe, clean, and managers are generally good to work for.   Location is a little difficult at time to get to.  Overall a good place."
good,"It's a grocery store. No time to mess around. You must get everything filled, made, baked, cooked and straightened at all times. Management is on you like glue all the time."
good,"I've only been working at Sprouts for a few weeks and so far I love it. Okay, maybe love is a bit extreme but I do like the job. I'm learning new vegetables and fruits that I've never hear of before and I love asking the guest about different recipes and what they like to make with certain products. Its a great job but it's repetitive and can get a bit boring, but overall I love the day shifts. As for closing shifts...yah...I hate it. Closing shifts are the worst because you have to prep the store for the next day and you have to do responsibilities that aren't even cashier related. Hope that helps."
good,"It is a nice place to work at but for me,I was part time and the only thing that I didnt like was they still cut hours. I did get offered another position on top of what I was doing already but I did not want that position they offered. If you work hard and be a team player you can jump up in this company. Most of my coworkers are nice and easy to get along with. Great place to gain experience."
good,"The best thing about working for Sprouts Farmers Markets is the employee store discount of 15%. Otherwise, there are no benefits, no PTO, nothing but unpaid missed work (which you are then punished for by a reduction in hours the following pay period) for the first YEAR OF EMPLOYMENT. Literally, the only reason to work here is for the easy money, ability to live a life around work, and the grocery discount. I went through two managers in just under a year, never received a promotion I worked so hard for, and eventually just moved on for better money. It is a fun place with good co-workers."
good,"my typical day at sprouts is to check email, complete orders, put orders away, end cap resets, expired checks. I learned time management and how to place orders, and how to prioritize. most people were friendly and easy to work with. hardest part of the job learning all the new products. but my most enjoyable part was learning and helping my coustomers"
good,"Hard busy days, but not as slow but lots of cleaning and stocking up at night for a new day at Sprouts Farmers Market. We have friendly co workers and managers that try to help out as much as they could. We provide the best customer service and high quality products."
good,the management was good. the coworkers were friendly. that job duties were simple and fun. and working with the customers was the best part of the job.
good,I enjoyed working there and the staff was always very considerate and helpful. I just felt that I was growing apart from the company and wanted more.
good,"Fun work environment, the people are nice, but the potential job advancement is almost nonexistent. Pay is high and get paid every week but the hours suck as well. There's no point in paying a lot if the hours are basically part time only. Full time position is never more than 30 hours a week and it is impossible to get 40 a week or more even if you wanted. BUT the people are GREAT!!"
good,This review may not reflect this location at this time. I was hired while the store was just opening and they over-hired just a bit. When I first started I was getting around 40 hours a week but by the end of the month I was down to about 5 hours per week. That being said they trained heavily in stocking and receiving so that employees could work fast and efficiently in those areas. Most of my day was set to daily duties which required a lot of heavy lifting (which I personally don't mind) and the rest of the day was solely for helping customers. They sometimes will send you to other stores even as far as from Englewood to Castlerock (Colorado).
good,It is a good place to begin your grocery store career. They are very friendly and always have great attitudes. Which makes it easier to go to work everyday.
good,"a typical work day was me jumping from bagging to produce, ect. say hello to everyone. what I have learned was what not to do at work and what to do at work. my last work place got me to understand what it means to keep a job and put 110% into it. co-workers there were all playful and everyone had to get there two cents in when it came to jokes. having to jump around the store working other departments"
good,A typical day of work as a courtesy clerk for Sprouts is a lot of stuff to do. If you have an endless supply of energy and determination to do hard work then this job is for you. I personally enjoy working for sprouts. Management is great and the employees are teamwork oriented. Overall its an enjoyable work experience.
good,A typical day at work is actually exciting and steady. I learn something different everyday. Management is great to work with. My co-workers are job scared. The hardest part of the job is feeling like you are over qualified for the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the different vitamins and supplement and health and beauty care. The produce and various food are great too.
good,"product moves very fast and is  priced right."
good,"Sprouts is a fairly new upcoming company here in Albuquerque, I love meeting new and having customers go thru my line daily and having fun conversation."
good,This job is great for someone with no experience and is looking for something flexible
good,I was a Cashier that loved my fellow co- workers. The most enjoyable part of the day was during the afternoon because I loved when the store was very busy. 
good,"I usually worked a 6-8 hour shift, checking out customers items and interacting with them. I learned more about cashiering than I did at my previous jobs because that was my main job duty. The managers always made time to talk to the employees when requested. My co-workers were very helpful, especially when I first started. There were times when it was very busy, constant line of customers almost the entire shift, which was very tiring. I did enjoy interacting with most of my customers, and there were some that became my regulars and I looked forward to seeing them."
good,"The work is hard, sometimes long hours. Management sometimes seemed to be poor, and at times I felt to be overworked. Overall, a great company to work for!"
good,"I liked the atmosphere at work, everyone seemed very friendly. It was a new store opening so there was lots of opportunity for overtime. I worked on two departments which was a bit confusing at times with the schedules. Occasionally I had to be at work very early and I ended up with headaches. I was on my feet all day and lost a lot of weight which was good. The only thing I didn't like was the lack of notice for shifts which made it very difficult to book doctor or dentist appointments."
good,"grocery stores are very busy there is always something to do and be productive. Customers come first always and even if they are not always friendly, management will support you in case of a complaint."
good,They are not best at training their employees so I usually ending up training myself in every position I held. The customers are an amalgamation of characters which will keep your work environment lively. The ideal job for transitioning until you find something better.
good,"Clear tasks are set for the day. Flexible with high school students. Good department manager. Paycheck every week is very helpful. You can also set up your own direct deposit, which is nice."
good,"Sprouts is crazy. I love all the workers there, and learned so much. Sprouts is just hungry to grow so corporate just sees you as another body. You can move up but not as easy as sprouts says it is."
good,"Overall my experience was fine, great first job. Management definitely needs some work for sure, they’re very laid back which comes as a blessing and a curse at times"
good,"I've worked in every single department. Every experience I've had in each department were pleasant and full of helpful team members on staff. Very easy to adapt to but not recommended for people looking for steady income. Depending on which department you're in, consistent work hours are not promised."
good,"Opening 3 days a week"
good,"Overall a good environment, great people, great culture. The managers are great and will help as much as needed. The training there could be better but overall great place"
good,Came in sing in the produce walk send the open cashier on the first break have good customer service be fast at the reg. Always get of on time get your tow days off per week
good,"The best part of the job is the other regular employees."
good,"learned excellent customer service skills and to work independently, amazing work environment, friendly staff members and every day was full of tasks."
good,Not much training and the expect you to be able to know all the codes by a month . Your trained on the basic of the register for a day. The pay for the job is fair.
good,"I feel that this company is kind to their employees. There is opportunities for job advancement, but not many. The pay was fair, and it was great experience."
good,"My time working here at Sprouts was really fun, I also learned a lot about customer service. The workers at Sprouts are hard workers that love to interact with the customers and with their co workers,"
good,"Not a bad place to work. always busy, friendly co workers. benefits weren't great and neither was pay. The management wasn't very friendly unfortunately and they shaved hours almost every other week."
good,"i started at the Brea Sprouts as a bulk clerk, and after a year i got my first promotion as bulk manager at the brand new Savi Ranch store (the only sprouts grand opening i experienced).  having been a 54 mile round trip to that store, i made a lateral move to Lakewood as a head cashier 9 months later.  5 months after that, they promoted me to 4th mgr at the orange store.  i was a roving 4th for a while and did time at both costa mesa stores, and ended up at the seal beach store for 2 years before i was set up by an employee.  "
good,"I would recommend to anyone who like a fast paced healthy environment. T"
good,"First Store Manager, stupendous. Second Store Management, self-preserving.. rocky start. Work culture totally shifted between one management to the next. "
good,"Sprouts has a great job culture, they always made me feel very welcome. Encouraging healthy living to customers and and generous prices. Benefits were good there."
good,Lot room for movement within company some good and some bad but opportunities are there highly  driven on customer service and employee motivation to be there day
good,The turn over rate is very high. The ladies in the bakery are always in a bad mood and unpleasant to deal with. One of the store managers Tracy is amazing along with Charles in grocery.
good,"I am a Produce Clerk for Sprouts Farmer Market and I enjoy it. The Job isn't too hard and they pay me a decent amount. When I first applied the store manager was kind and easy to talk to, plus he started me off paying me over the minimum (10.50 at the time). The working atmosphere is great, the co-workers are kind and so are the managers. The managers usually have morning and afternoon huddles where they talk about what we are doing well and what we need to improve on. I'd say the hardest part of my job is putting up with customers who are insufferable and want things a certain way even if we can't produce those results. I have enjoyed working for Sprouts and it had helped me with paying my college tuition. I highly recommend Sprouts"
good,"Good crew. The management changed regularly while I was there, so the scheduling was far from consistent. Good all around vibe. Great customers. Clean, great selection of groceries produce and bulk foods. The hardest part of the job was a bit of heavy lifting."
good,"Great staff, fun environment, work is easy to learn and coworkers are friendly. Customers are usually nice. If you have a good work ethic you more likely to get more hours, even though I worked part time I could still get scheduled 32-36 hours on a good week."
good,"During a typical day at work you will be expected to perform your job tasks, while also potentially undertaking other departments in emergencies. This will give individuals that want to develop robust skill-sets for the service industry an opportunity to grow and be promoted within the company."
good,"A great environment for having happy and close co workers. It is fast pace but it helps move the time along. There are many positions to cover different opportunities for growth and possibilities for advancement. It has a deli, bakery, meat market, bulk and vitamins departments just to name a few. It is a lot of standing on your feet but its nothing too intense to not be able to handle. So over all if you are looking to start out at a tight nit community of coworkers and have reasonable hours and pay, Sprouts is for you."
good,"Job environment is usually very steady and calm during week days. Like all retail when it's time of the year to be busy, its busy! hard work is paid off and it is not difficult to get promotions"
good,its a good start job if you are a college student like me. they do work well with your schedule if you have school and family. i learned a lot as a bookkeeper. i am glad that sprouts has a lot of faith in me.
good,"Pays decent and if you are lucky to get full time hours, you might get by. Management not savvy on how to talk to employees, or how to handle stressful situations. Nice customers and good coworkers."
good,The management tries their best to understand the needs of their work force. The job was easy if you did not make things harder for yourself. You can advance through the company if you show the want for it as well.
good,"I only go to work at Sprouts for about 3-4 months but the time I spent there was fast-paced, fun and I enjoyed working there. I would definetly recommend Sprouts to a friend."
good,"A good place to work. It has everything that it's supposed to have for employees. Insurance, 401K, . Lockers for your personal items. "
good,Excellent work environment with motivated team members to help assist any customers that required assistance. Had an opportunity to get to know several different customers on a first name basis and well as there children. I was responsible for making sure that all products in the dairy department were ordered and correctly stocked to ensure maximum sales. I did have the opportunity to get experience in the grocery business and was able to work under a great dairy manager who taught me several valuable lessons. I can honestly say that there was not a day that went by that I considered my job hard or stressful.
good,"Working fro Sprouts and it's pros and cons , as every job does. When I was in Mesa, AZ I had a great management team, very caring and supportive. Fellow teammates were very nice and easy to work with. Customers were nice and most of the time very easy to work with."
good,"Working in the Meat Department at Sprouts as  meat cutter was a great experience. I started as a meat clerk and my manager took me under his wing and taught me how to cut meat."
good,Productive and fast paced . I get in at 4 am slice all the deli meats and cheese for the sales floor. I fill and face the sales floor and get it ready for customers to come in.
good,Sprouts employee were always helpful and enjoyable to work with. Everyone there were very helpful and assisting when you needed any help. Enjoyed working with the department manager.
good,"Generally better and less stressful than other grocery management positions, but I was still working a ton of hours.  I was chided by some of my bosses for doing so, but whenever I went home at a reasonable hour something went wrong and our chops were busted. In grocery, there always seems to be an emergency and reasons why you can't go home.  I actually worked more than many of the store managers.  Weekly inventory is crazy and the overnights that are needed I personally view as cruel and unusual punishment, but seem to be par for the course in grocery.  Better pay than safeway, though not as much bonus potential compared to east coast grocers.  Good, but not great."
good,"Its your typical grocery store job. Always busy and always have something that needs to be done. The day does go by quick which is a plus, in my opinion."
good,A great company to work for just inconsistency with hours.I love what I do I enjoy my customers reaction to my work ethics. I enjoy my work team I just need more hours.
good,"My hours have fluctuated like crazy. I transferred departments, and after a month, the hours there got even worse. if you don't mind part-time, great place, but if you are desperate for full-time work, keep looking. When the U of A is on summer break, our business drops so much that hours in all departments are slashed, and corporate is making us bring on more people on top of that.It's a lovely place to work, but the hours are too few and far between."
good,Started at Sprouts and they have better then market average pay for this type of job. People and managers are great to work with. The environment is good and welcoming but it can be very stressful.
good,Basically a good company with lots of competition so employee performance is very important to them.  Staffing is not what it should be...why ??  Its hard work but the benefits are good and in some cases better than normal.
good,"A lot of opportunities for advancement. I worked for sprouts in several states. They even helped with my relocation to a new market. I wish the benefits, bonuses, and salary were better."
good,The job is very demanding but is fun to be around so many types of people from all walks of life. The employee discount and employee appreciation is a big change for the better with this company compared to others.
good,I made so many great friends while working for this company. There really weren't any dull moments. The job was fairly easy and so was moving up. The management was really hard to deal with most of the time and a lot of their practices were unfair. Sudden changes to longstanding rules and procedures were common.
good,"I did what needed doing, when asked. Possible to establish a routine and do it daily but with life's inherit chaos, everyday was different. Break room was fine."
good,"I was a baggage handler most of the time. I also helped out in all departments of the store on a regular basis. I enjoyed my time there at sprouts, and as it was my first job it set a great prerequisite for the requirements of a productive and conducive work environment."
good,"Working for Sprouts is a wonderful career. I am just ready to leave retail and food service. "
good,"This place is good to work if you've never had a job before, or if you're looking for something that is more stable. They usually don't have enough hours if you need to work more than 20 hours a week. "
good,Fun and positive work environment.  Benefits and compensation was great. Competitive pay and benefits.  Got to interact with team members and customers.
good,"Great place to learn new skills, but the money is not great at all. Not only that but there are also no set schedules so your schedule is constantly changing week by week and day by day."
good,"The supervisors in my department are very professional but I don't get enough hours on the amount of labor at hand, we do however get store discount."
good,"I work with a great department manager, who enjoys having fun and keeping the team up beat and motivated. It's been a great experience in meeting different people and providing great customer service."
good,"My day was pretty stressful at sprouts. Day in and day out, never really had anyone I could lean on to help me out with day to day duties. Management wasn't all that helpful with agreeing with what other management was doing. Overall, I did enjoy my job and wish I would of never left. Great pay and great benefits."
good,"There's a real team effort everyday when I go in. Everyone pitches in and gives excellent customer service. I work in the vitamin section where there are over 8000 items for sale so you have to have a good memory of where things are. My supervisor is great! I have her cell phone number so if I can't find something, she can tell me where it is. Things can get intense if a customer is upset but management backs us up if need be. Pay sucks, but I was an RN and used to great pay before I retired. I just do this part time, but after a lifetime in the ER this is a breath of fresh air! I love it here."
good,It is a great environment with lots of good people working there. But the pay is not enough to survive on. It is a all around easy job if u have half a brain and are willing to put in just a little effort you will strive there. But you will not be making much more then minimum wage unless u plan on making a career out of it.
good,"Sprout's is a great company to work for , advanced health information is always being provided for the customer to be satisfied and have an understanding at what kind of product that is potentionally being purchased. A typical day at work can be described as busy but with the different products being asked for can teach you something new about an ingredient the next customer then has an exact idea into what the customer is purchasing. Initially all customers have a good answer to their questions for other purchrchasa"
good,"My time at Sprouts Farmers Market was a definitely a good one. It was very fast pace and enjoyable while I was there, my coworkers were great for the most part, they taught me a lot. I learned a great deal about patience, sacrifice, and what it's like to be an adult. My management was majorly great, the manager of my store was really helpful and understanding, he helped me a lot while I was there. Typically, my day would consist of coming in and heading to a register, unless I was needed elsewhere, such as the bulk department which I spent a good amount of time in. And i'd either stay on the register or go where I was needed until the end of my shift. If I was closing i'd pitch in and do my fair share of the closing duties, such as putting out the adds, cleaning the front, taking out the garbage, fronting all of the shelves, or even helping bring in carts from the lot. Hands down my favorite parts of the job were the relationships i built with my coworkers and all of the regulars that came in. Developing a relationships with your coworkers is important, but so it developing relationships with your customers. The most difficult part was probably closing when we were short staffed, I had this job while I was still in high school, so when I would close on a school night and we didn't have many people there, it was stressful. That's about it, really. It was a fairly enjoyable experience."
good,"I have payroll to process first thing in the mornings"
good,"Overall and pretty good place to work, you can move up quickly if you are a hard honest worker.Like any other job you will have good and bad people there. Some stores are better to work than others, the store I am at everyone works together and is supportive of each other.Discount on purchases is not bad. More store are going to open up in the area, so many many opportunities."
good,This job is very easy for fast pace learners and it gets repetitive over time.Thats all I can really say this job should be a second job since they do cut hours a lot.
good,Fun place to work with many different departments.  Multiple layers of management sometimes create confusion.  The most enjoyable part of this job was the people and learning experience.
good,"My experience having worked at multiple locations with Sprouts Farmers Market is that it's a generally pleasant environment, if you're okay with remaining fairly static in your position. Coworkers and management are friendly, but corporate is detached from the daily goings on of most employees below the middle management level."
good,I learned a lot about health at Sprouts. Had the opportunity to try new foods. Easy going work space. Nice management and co-workers.
good,"At Sprouts, there are many opportunities to learn about all natural groceries, vitamins/supplements and healthy lifestyles. The store teams and support teams exude a positive and fun culture! In the southeast region, there are many opportunities in the stores to grow a career because of the wide expansion taking place."
good,"Hard work, nice people, co workers .Not a lot of hours, expectations are high. Good as a second job."
good,Every morning I would be at work at 5am to be the morning opener to the Food/Deli Department. I learned how to use the scales to weigh out the foods to be ready to be portioned in the food trays. As a Assistant Manager I had a huge responsibility to provide excellent work skills to other employees and to the Store Manager. There were no hard part in my department because we always had help from all co-workers.
good,"once a week a set up and take down of an ad"
good,Financially very productive local grocery store. I have learned the value of doing things yourself. As well as a little of how businesses operate. The hardest part is giving the customer what they want how they want when it's not possible to be done. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers with organic information and products.
good,"I loved interacting with customers everyday. Management was pleasant and accessible. Worked well with other employees. A enjoyable, professional, and very customer service-oriented environment."
good,In all honesty it was alright. Management cuts hours from Front End. Gives over time to other departments.
good,"i cut and packaged meat for sale and helped customers find products. my colleagues were grate people. i liked this job very much. my only complaint is, i entered at the slowest part of the season and couldn't afford to work there."
good,"Sprouts was very flexible with my school schedule, They were very supportive and a very awesome team to be apart of. Working there taught me a lot about customer service. I made good friends with all my co-worker. The management wanted to promote me but as the last days of me being in school approach i had to put in my two weeks and say good bye to the awesome experience i had working at Sprouts."
good,"The employees and management at Sprouts are very friendly. The hardest part of the job is making adjustments for each individual customer, the most enjoyable part of the job is making a customers' day better than it was. It makes work easier when everyone can work together."
good,"Working here is like still being in highschool, drama here and there, but if your there for work, its great! management always takes time out of their day to hear you out, or even help you. they complement you on your great work. customers can get racist."
good,"Steady and varied work, interesting learning opportunities, comfortable environment with mostly good coworker relations.  Felt I could rely on coworkers for help and they could rely on me.  Upper management rarely backed us up with difficult customers, though, i.e. telling us one thing and then siding with the customer when we tell them what the manager told us."
good,They pay fair for experience but they will give you little hours and/or change what they hired you for without notifying you possibly changing your hourly pay.
good,I picked Vitamin clerk because I enjoy this subject to the utmost. It is inspiring to me to help customers with their health goals. I provided neat and tidy shelves. Up to date products and information to my customers.
good,"As a curtusy clerk, my job is all over the place. They have me working in different sections to help fill in where ever i can. The only big issues I have with the store i work in is the lack of hours then give."
good,Busy all of the time. Excellent training but the pay could be alot better. At times a lot of favoritism between management and certain departments within the store. A good starter job.
good,I worked at Sprouts Farmers Market for 2 years and it was flexible for me as a college student. I loved working in floral department which was really flexible hours and I could use my creative side.
good,"There is a good atmosphere here. The employees get along. Most managers are very approachable including the store manager. If you have issues with scheduling or job duties, you can talk to just about anyone in management and they'll find a way to help you out."
good,"My experience at sprouts was overall my most positive work experience to date. Of course every job has its nuisances but when compared to the friendly and understanding environment that was provided at sprouts and the realistic work requisites, i highly recommend Sprouts as a entry level employment opportunity."
good,Over all its a good place to work. Hours per week vary quite a bit unless you are a supervisor / management. The staff is friendly and have positive attitudes.
good,"Enjoy working as scan coordinator. Great hours, good pay."
good,"Overall my experience working at Sprouts was great! Culture was fun, management changed constantly, pay was fair, busy fast-paced store may time go by quickly, great training program"
good,"I worked at Sprouts over the summer and I enjoyed it. I was working 40 hours/week there and 12/week at another job, so I was very busy. Being a clerk is definitely less stress than being a department manager or store manager."
good,"A typical day at work depending upon what day it is can get steady or very busy, I learned customer service, the most enjoyable was there were the discounts, employee appreciations, some of the co-workers made it fun to work there."
good,15% discount off groceries is a huge plus when it comes to a job that has a very loyal customer base. Job may be a little draining but it really depends on management and where you live.
good,"I am thankful for this job because I’m a way I was forced to deal with all kinds of people, including managers, supervisors, coworkers and customers. I’m able to adapt to different departments and deal with different work variations and times of the day ."
good,"I had to see only 2 of the 5 mangers I had ever doing some actual work.  Everyone else is just on the phone or talking all day or watching the camera like its TV. The employees do become like family though, it makes it harder to leave or be fired. Sprouts is a laid back environment with great customers who are only agitated on weekends, and a team who provide just the right amount of effort, if you ask me."
good,"Management has a good understanding of workplace balance and is flexible regarding family matters and concerns. Despite the changes in executive leadership existing leadership still functioned at a high-level, which was good."
good,"Good benefits like sick time and vacation time, even 401k for parttimers."
good,I really enjoy my job but the pay is atrocious.  The only way you could afford to live while working at sprouts is if you had a dual income with a partner and lived with them to share expenses or if you are upper level management.
good,"My typical workday as a manager was coming in, checking for important emails. Then I would walk my floor and check conditions of the department. Tidy up and stock shelves as needed. Order products for shelves. Check on customer returns, create reports on returns. Contact vendors and submit customer returns for credits. Write out daily tasks for my team. Write out the team work schedule for the week. Fill out shrink reports, profits, and projection reports. Provide customer service. Reprimand any team member that didn't follow through tasks assigned. Schedule trainings for my team for products the department carried. Participated in meetings for the store. Answered any team members questions and addressed their concerns. Delegated tasks throughout the team. Followed up on customer special orders. Reviewed labor budgets."
good,"Sprouts Farmers Market is a fast-paced and engaging environment, there is always something to do. The main drawbacks were local management that came later after hiring, but overall co-workers are fun and diverse,"
good,Sprouts taught me a bit about healthy living. Venturing more into the vegan culture seeing the care and time put into organic foods. Coworkers were very friendly.
good,Have more of a welcoming attitude whlith customers as well as employees. On a regular basis. Sometime it's too serious. For the most part it is a great place to work. Love the culture.
good,"The Deli department of Sprouts was a reasonable place to work, it wasn't particularly difficult, nor was it particularly strict. As a temporary job I rather liked it, but I doubt I'd want to work there long term. Evidence of this sentiment was reflected in the continual stream of employees who found a better job elsewhere, and quit."
good,"The community in and around the store is great, but the friendly nature of the management results in a makes the work inconsistent at best. Great benefits and friendly atmosphere."
good,"Became familiar with various products and their uses to assist customer's questions/concerns. "
good,"was with sprouts for a total of three years. Started with bulk foods then asked to be moved on over to cashier. Management was hands down incredible, coworkers were amazing and quite possibly the best. Only gripes I have is in regards to how corporate functions."
good,This is a fast-paced job. Pretty fun place to work. Staff and management were above par.... Not much flexibility with scheduling... quick growth / cross - training within company
good,my co-workers were nice but the pay sucked. the customer were generally pretty nice and never made messes. And if they did they would tell someone and not just leave it there
good,I was a stay at home mom of 3 and wanted something to get me out of the house talking with grown up. Sprouts has given me the schedule I need to be home with my kids and help out at their schools. The pay is not great and sometimes I'm unhappy with the cleanliness of the store but the other workers and managers are nice to work with and I actually like working there. I love the discount and all the perks they give us for shopping there. I feel that management does appreciate us and give back to us when they can but it feels like their hands are tied a lot and would give back more to their employees if they can. I think that Sprouts could definitely spend some money on updating our particular store to make it look more appealing to both customers and staff to continue going.
good,Management is really kuick back easy going but fair as well. clean environment/place to work for. Only downside is they willcut hours for everybody when it is slow timw
good,This job was good and there was a lot of room for moving up from the lowest position. The pay on the other hand is not fair. One cashier could be making min wage and the other could be making dollars more. Its a fast pace job  and good people.
good,I worked for Sprouts over 10 years and lots of different locations. The company is growing fast and is always changing. If you have knowledge of natural foods and grocery business you are in luck because the training is very hands on. Good co workers and friendly atmosphere with the right manager. Very hard place to work with a micro manager.
good,"If you want to clean chicken, this is the job for you.  Many duties, few breaks.  The coolers are somewhat cramped, but the employees are friendly, the customers, not so much."
good,"its a good place but i cant ask for days off due to not having enough coverage, they never hire enough people, and lots of work for one person to handle,"
good,I felt like the environment was very family based. Everyone took care of each other well. It can either be fast paced or slow depending on the day and time. The discount was great and allowed employees to eat healthier and more organic food
good,"I dont really remember because I had two deaths in my family during that time. My grandma past away from her brain cancer, and my best friend killed her self. I was going through alot at that time including being separated from my mother ."
good,"Enjoyed working here. However, working front-end was always a hassle and did not receive the appropriate pay for what we had to deal with. Other positions received more pay. Overall, good for a first job or for students if you like working in a busy environment."
good,"I loved working there. The new store manager who took over right before I left was ok, but I didnt get to know how he operated before i needed to move. I loved working in the bakery, my boss was super great about working with my availability, while giving me 25-40 hours a week. i loved getting to set up the displays and working on my own, yet still getting to interact with my coworkers. the pay was ok, but could have been better. I only got about $10 an hour, but it was easy enough work, so kinda fair, i guess."
good,It's a small company so you often help out in other departments around the store. The promotions are always available if you want to move up within the company.
good,"The management is very lax, everyone is all so relaxed. Customers are great, some problems, but minor. Growing in the company is a possibility, and very easy to transfer to another state. Great prices, discount for employee and even 1 person you live with."
good,Was a great company to work for. They started changing this around in the company that made it harder for they employees. its more about the money they make then there employees
good,My overall experience for SPROUTS  was great . Only issues were the 1hr commute one way to work and then 1 1/2 hrs to get home. So after a period of  time I put in for 2 different job transfer to be near home (10 min away) and was turned down . That was my only downside to this job .
good,Sprouts is a wonderful place to work if you are looking for consistent work while having fun. the work was fun but the pay did not add up to the amount that i felt i was working.
good,"I truly enjoyed working at Sprouts. Sprouts wants all employees to have fun at work, but do the work that is assigned. Very customer oriented. I will do anything to make sure that customer is satisfied. I did have some customers come in and ask for me to help them. It is a face paced position, but very rewarding."
good,"My manager is amazing, as are the key managers for the store. My coworkers are nice and easy to get along with too. You don't get a lot of hours unless you're a manager though, I go from working 20+ hours one week to about 12 the next. The discount when applied with sales going on within the store is pretty good. Pay is weekly which is nice too."
good,Sprout's was definitely one of my favorite place to work; I wish they had a one where I live now. I got along well with my co-workers and boss and enjoyed the work I had to do.
good,It was a nice company but needed more hours. Every co worker was nice though thats what helped alot. If they gave more hours i think working there would be no problem
good,"if your're looking for a job that pay you hourly and have some talk while you're working whether is with a customer or your co-worker working at Sprouts Farmers Market is your best choice."
good,"great hours and originally had amazing management but they left. The new management cut hours, doesn't work with my schedule, and is rude and authoritative"
good,"Yes, it gets busy. Yes, management can be a little wonky at times.. but overall, the job is fast paced and a lot of fun because of the healthy environment and upbeat 60's-80's music. Attitude is everything and it can either make or break your day."
good,"-Hardest part of the job anticipating what customers are going to be purchasing and how to not run out of product in certain areas. "
good,Sprouts is a fun and competitive job environment to work at  until the hours start to dry up then you're basically begging management for more hours. Pay raises seem like a mystery.
good,"Overall, your typical grocery store experience, but with a farmer's market feel. Food is fresh and everything is made there. They are very charitable."
good,Enjoyed the option of working overtime. I was flexible for work hours so I worked the hours when they needed me and overtime when short handed. Job was enjoyable.
good,"Sprouts deems itself on being a family/friendly type of grocery store and it does live up to those expectations. On a normal day, usually business is pretty steady during the morning hours leading into early afternoon but as the day's end gets nearer we'd usually get a rush of customers but because the employees are very well trained, business moves pretty fast. Working at sprouts is very enjoyable because not only are you benefiting from discounts and there's always room to advance in your career there. Employees are almost always getting raises and/or promotions!"
good,"I have been with the company for three years. I am currently at a great store. Previous stores I made plenty lasting friendships with customers and employees. But the new store that I am at actually is trying to help me advance in the company. Its great. We are a farmers market. Not the traditional type, but it is becoming the new trend."
good,"If you don't voice your interest in trying out different departments, you are missing out.  Overall, I had a fun time working around mostly young people and having the opportunity to see all kinds of customers come in."
good,"Productive work place, providing customers with fast and friendly service. Listening and helping customers them with their concerns or needs of product in the store. Management is good. There is really no hard part of the job, The most enjoyable would be working with customers you see on a daily basic."
good,Sprouts was a fun and friendly workplace. They have a unique style and all the members of their staff were inviting. I would recommend Sprouts to both work at and attend if you have young children!
good,"My location was right by the beach!"
good,"My experience working there is a good one, everyone is friendly and courteous with one another and exeryone works together to achieve the common goal in dealing with the customers on a daily basis."
good,"Sprouts is great if you are going to college, and need supportive income.  Fun place to work, however very hard to make advancement in the vitamin department due to politics."
good,"I have worked at this company for over a year, its been great overall. The job itself has had its ups & downs but overall its good as a starter job or if you enjoy helping people. I personally enjoy the customer service aspect of being a grocery clerk."
good,"i make side salads, chickens , turkey pot roasts, all sorts a food . sliced deli meats and cheeses. its fast paced and ive learned how to really work fast."
good,"Good people to work for, there is room for growth, good discount and one discount card for another family member to use. I learn a lot from the customers who come in on how they fix food I've never cooked before."
good,"Dependent on your region you work in, and your store management team, it can be a great place to work. Room for advancement. I've had some great opportunities."
good,"I enjoy being around people and even making customers day with just a simple smile. But some of the employees hired make the job difficult because I have to apologize constantly for their actions, even after numerous coachings."
good,"This is a large corporation, to get ahead you have to stand out! I think management style has a lot to do with the positivity or negativity of the store and the culture and atmosphere it has. Each store is different, I really learned the importance of respect and how you approach certain situations."
good,As a employee for sprouts farmers market the pay isn't that great but we get are work done and communicate well with each other.
good,"Running all day"
good,"Working with customers throughout the day to benefit the company, stocking and making products. Helping customers with any problems one might have. You learn communication skills that are beneficial throughout any career."
good,"Good place to work, nice employees. Needs better pay. Hours get cut a lot, which effects pay checks. Store atmosphere is good. Clean."
good,"This job was actually not that bad, everybody was very involved and polite with all workers. The only reason I had to quit was just the fact that I did not make the amount of money that i wanted to make"
good,The management from specific departments was well organized and respectful to their employees. I liked working in the bakery department for many reasons but I really appreciated the respect from my supervisors.
good,"Sprouts was a good place to work, at times the management was less than ideal and employees were disrespected and ignored. My particular job was not bad at all, except I was taken advantage of oftentimes and was required to not only do my job, but know all the jobs in the store and ""help"" other departments, which often left me behind on my actual work.However, as I was in my last days at sprouts, new management took over, and the work environment seemed to be improving."
good,good work environment upper management was supportive. hours are hard to get but can be gotten.benefits are good when they are offered
good,The amount of work that is required of me in this deli is the workload of two people.  I enjoy the other closer that i work with and it is very challenging work.  I have customer service skills that are beyond reproach.
good,"great place to learn under the right management. stressful and sometimes rewarding work. "
good,"At Sprouts the coworkers were great and definitely the perk of the job. I loved going in and walking through the store to the back room saying hello to everyone as I walked by them. Even if you're new, the other employees always made the new ones feel right at home. A lot of the department managers, as well as some of the store managers, where great and I always enjoyed working for them. However, some of the store managers did not run things efficiently. When things would break down, like the sink in the produce backroom or leaks in the cooling fans of the produce cooler, they refused to fix them immediately, which is an audit and health code violation if I'm not mistaken. Also, when I worked as the florist, the company would not allow the florists enough time to properly do their job. Because the company gave the florist too many restrictions, the floral department only made 1% of the produce sales when it had the potential to make a minimum of 5-10% if given the time to grow. The managers of Sprouts also procrastinated in giving pay raises. Myself and multiple other employees were due for a pay raise, we were not given one right away and some of us, including me, were not given one at all. The people of Sprouts Farmers Market are not bad overall, but the work environment isn't where it could be."
good,"A typical work day depends on the department you're in. Normally you report to your manager then they delegate tasks. I would be by myself in a department and knew what I needed to do. Break down a load, stock, work backstock, and organize. I learned that it's very easy to work there. Coworkers were great. Most of management were okay. Hardest part of the job was being blamed for things my manager did. The most enjoyable was stocking."
good,I enjoyed this market. Great employees to work with. I was able to learn more about the Bakery Department and how it functions on a daily basis.It took some getting used to being up so early in the mornings (5 am) but it turned out to be an easy transition.
good,"Aside from having to do over the intercom announcements every 15 minutes, I would council many individuals on what they would take in the way of vitamins and minerals, overall I would say that is the best part of the job being able top one on one with people and having that be what it is that you are supposed to do. The managers were all great and would listen if that is what needed to happen, and the store director is an amazing man, always having time for any employee that needed to talk or needed some advice be it work or other related matter. The clientele of the store varied greatly, from people that are just hoping for some groceries to people that are really into the diet and health world and overall just living a better life."
good,"I was just a simple cashier in a farmer's market.  I learned very quickly that cognitive awareness in a job is a skill that can be honed with practice.  Asking questions and getting to know my co-workers was key to learning the numerical system that just about every commercial food store uses to list every food item for purchase."
good,"Work was pretty busy, I cut and prepped meats for both gourmet and service counters, made sure the department was always clean. I really enjoyed the people I worked with, the customers and my co-workers alike were all very kind people. The hardest part about working there had to be management and holidays. Things were never run properly, schedules were always all over the place. It was a mess sometimes."
good,"By and large, it is a good company to work for in Norman. Not much is in Norman except for retail and fast food. Sprouts is one of the better paying ones. The management here is more personable and friendly than most other grocery places I have worked, which are usually filled mentally ill and condescending management. As a resident closer, I pretty much do the same thing everyday and work the same hours. I would say a pretty huge bonus are the free vitamin samples, which are often available. There is a huge problem with the store hiring just whoever, which has made for lazy workers to pick up after, and also hostile workers that they don't seem to want to fire. If you are a good worker and are easily frustrated with the bad ones, don't plan on working here long. They project high standards, but do not enforce them."
good,started work by breaking down the load then checked what we needed on the counter the most . started to cut the meat then i wrapped it all up the proceeded to put it on the counter cleaned up my area and got things set up for the next shift
good,"good job, but was just not for me at the time I was working their."
good,Sprouts is a great place to get a mixture of organic and conventional products. They provide great check out service as well as great assistance on items you can't find.
good,if you are looking for a decent generic grocery store employment opportunity Sprouts is for you. Decent people and co-workers are to be found at Sprouts.
good,"I really liked working there. I enjoyed every bit of my job, just not getting carts outside when it was 102 degrees outside. But far as everything else it was easy and fun. I want to get back into grocery markets again."
good,"Responds positively to customer’s inquiries and assists customers with questions about produce."
good,"Days all ways varied, but I gained skills in Most of the major departments From Grocery, front end and much more."
good,"Typical day of customer service"
good,"great job with room to grow... a lot of cross training... only problem is when co workers call off there's a lot more work to do & when it gets busy and trust me its gets busy... you will be running around, bagging for the cashiers or actually cashiering, which means you will be pulled away from pulling load and stocking... downside.. the pay is low even though I was cross trained in 4 departments..."
good,I would normally arrive at around 430 and take inventory of what we had stocked of sales floor and make a plan for how to make the most meals and stock my sales floor fully. manage a team of 5-8 people and assign a task to each individual to make my department run as efficiently as possible and manage time properly. I learned how to be an effective leader and help people learn the most to help them succeed. my coworkers were helpful in teaching me how to be the best I could be and make the company the most money. hardest part was learning the ropes and setting up a schedule and getting team to stick with it to make our department as successful as possible and getting them to learn to follow direction from someone so young . the most enjoyable part of my team was seeing how good we could be if we worked together and trying to be the best ranking store in the company.
good,"Busy store. Wednesday, Saturday, and Sundays were the most busiest days. Learned about produce, inventory, customer service, stock, and trim produce. Management was pretty cool depending in what store you are working at. Co-Workers were all awesome we all clicked as a team. The hardest part of the job will have to be when management over pressure us on our busiest days. Otherwise, very easy job. The most enjoyable part of the job was when our department would get extra help."
good,"Typical day at Work:"
good,"Co workers were amazing, I learned a lot from this job, had a lot of fun, I was a manager and so I did scheduling, ran the store, etc. The hardest part of this job was dealing with the not so happy customers, but that was also the most enjoyable part. I love people, I love interacting with people and doing what it takes to make the customer/people happy."
good,"I stocked the store from back to front. I only worked here for 2 months, but I was able to get a feel for general operations. I enjoyed this job a lot, especially getting paid weekly!"
good,"Overall Sprouts was  good place to work at, management is great."
good,"A typical day for a cashier at Sprouts would start with clocking in. Where I would then go to the front to be assigned to a drawer and check stand! I immediately open up, and start my day of helping customers by ringing up their groceries, handling returns, complaints, requests for an unfound item, and general interesting conversation. I would say that constant interaction with different people and customers was the most enjoyable part of the job. I was always learning new things as well as teaching people about subjects."
good,Love working for Sprouts.  Made quite a few great new friends.  Learned how to have great quality customer service skills.
good,"Employee-employee relations is good. Employee-management relation is also good. Start the day at work by conducting survey on what items are needed. Then retrieve the items at the warehouse and then start filling up the bins which are half filled or almost empty. The hardest part of the job is the often lifting boxes, nevertheless it is manageable. For me the job is enjoyable because as I am working I am interacting with clients and providing customer service. The company provide health insurance, 401K, holiday pay, vacation and sick leaves."
good,Very easy to follow work. Preparing food. Some management could use some improvement on discretion and enthusiasm. Almost all co-workers are friendly and enjoyable. Everyone is hard-working. The hardest part of my job is remembering exact lists of ingredients for each specific meal or cut of meat or cheese. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customer service and interaction.
good,It is a good company to work for if you have other obligations such as college. The only problem is that they will not give you enough hours to support yourself.
good,"I always thought it was good to lead by example.  Work shoulder to shoulder with team members.  Arrive to work early.  Learn something personal about each team member - ie: dogs name, college attending, etc...  Work Hard and Follow all the rules!"
good,"Working with this company was a great place to work for. There are some days where they are a bit overwhelming. But the people I have worked were always willing to help me out especially when I was going to school. "
good,"Good company with lots of potential.  Crazy churn at the executive level.  Talent at the C level was suspect until the changes.  Lots of opinions and flying by the seat of their pants, no real analytical approach.  15% discount on groceries."
good,"I've made some really cool friends while working here and my managers have been great. I have heard stories in the past of the opposite but again, all jobs have bad management somewhere. "
good,"This is a wonderful work environment and a positive place to start in the workplace. However, just like every retail job out there, they pay you just about diddly squat no matter how hard you work. I work much harder than anyone else at my store but there is no opportunity for a raise except for one a year on your anniversary. This is the BEST store you could work at. I love it. much"
good,"A typical work day was basic and simple, check in with the manager after reviewing product items on sale for the day. And then open my lane by signing on the register and start checking out customers items. One major thing I did learn is how important team work is, and how smooth the day would go when everyone would help each other. I feel management of the amount of one customers purchase could be overwhelmingly, but would be manageable."
good,"I've learned how to handle food correctly and feel that my people skills have improved while working there , happy to work there all the time . Good people and work environment"
good,The job was good and I enjoyed the store but the management was kind of bad. The manager didnt seem to care about the stores well being or the employees. And the assistant manager was seen screaming at the top of his lungs several times at employees in the middle of the store in front of customers.
good,Sprouts gave a lot of opportunities for growth and was quick to spot employees that were putting extra effort into their work. I appreciate Sprouts for creating a positive environment where I felt I could grow and gain responsibilities.
good,"Sprouts is a great place to work. They offer the ability to move up in the company pretty easily if you're a hard worker. The deli department is fast paced but usually short staffed. Because of the staffing issues typical of the grocery industry, you tend to do a lot of work for not enough pay when in a management position. Great company except for their pay system based on experience. It allows for dedicated employees who have been there for years to get underpaid and screwed over by the increases in minimum wage. New employees coming in at lower positions have the potential to make the same or more than managers. Plus, it's difficult to get a good quality raise to compensate for pay differences. Other than this, the work environment is fun and friendly and makes time go by fast. Great people to work with generally speaking."
good,The environment of people that both work there and shop there are usually very friendly and enriching. It is definitely one of the better Grocery stores to work for.  Decent hours and pay.
good,"A typical day was usually smooth and fast-paced. I helped customers every single day because Sprout's is a widely shopped store.  Everyone there was nice including both employees and the customers.  The hardest part of the job staying warming the cooler, but I found the formula for that.  The most enjoyable part of the job is breaking down load."
good,"Great working environment, friendly coworkers and customers, on top of giving employees their breaks and up to date on trainings. Bosses are willing to work with you on availability and time needed off."
good,Working for Sprouts helped me more with my communication skills and customer service. It also shaped my ability to handle difficult situation dealing with customer compliance.
good,I learned a lot from this job about how to talk more to customers and to answer phone calls. Very much help on pushing me to do something I wasn't comfortable on .
good,"I’ve learned to approach people better than the vibes I get off of them. You can always turn someone’s day around. I absolutely love helping people as well so it would personally make me want to do better for myself! Thinking positive will attract positive coming to you, it’s made many positions I’ve got in a lot more comfortable being positive!!"
good,"have to be very fast, always busy, not enough pay, not enough hours, not what you were asked upon hire, good managers, amazing awesome food, best prices for organic everything, and friendly customers."
good,This was a good job but if you were going to be even one minute late they would dock a point. Coming over from two buses is hard if one was late and you missed the other because of it. May as well call in with that standard and I seen a lot of higher ups lose their jobs due to it. I lost my job due to a schedule change that caused me to lose 6 points and be fired. U believe since I had it in my 2 weeks they didn't tell me so I was unable t be rehired.
good,Sprouts is a very family friendly environment and has a very positive atmosphere. They give good break times for the amount of hours worked. The only reason I am leaving is because I need more hours.
good,I greatly enjoyed working at sprouts. I liked my managers and the people I worked with. The pay wasn't great.  I  started at 8.00 an hour and ended at 9.75. The customers were very nice for the most part. I really liked my managers. They made it easy to want to come to work. I got to meet people from all around the world which I really enjoyed. There wasn't a lot of chances for advancement tho in the company
good,it was a very productive fast pace environment to work in but great job the hardest part of the job is being able to work in a fast pace everyday and be able to handle very busy store.i learned some culinary skills in this deli and good retail experience. a typical day of work at sprouts is running around multi tasking more than one thing at a time and being able to give good customer service well doing all that .
good,"Sprouts will promote if you are willing to give the effort and have the talent. Pay is not great for the hourly employees, but the management makes good pay."
good,"My time at Sprouts, although brief, was enjoyable. It did not offer the opportunity to grow friendships with coworkers as much as other jobs, but it did create a strong foundation for my customer service skills. All employees are required to help customers if requested. If a customer needs to find a certain bread, they can ask any employee from any department for help. I really appreciate the customer-first attitude they implement at Sprouts."
good,"As a courtesy clerk, you're basically a janitor. You have to bring carts, clean bathrooms, offices, break room,  relax area. You have to do everything and you are usually closing by yourself."
good,"The coworkers here were very friendly. For the most part, the customers were very friendly and talkative. There was however strict hours and lots of work to be done."
good,"If you can ignore the drama and not take anything there much more seriously than you have to, it's a pretty great place to work.  Management turns over all the time, so if you don't like the store manager, it's easy to wait a few months for a new one to take over."
good,"Sprouts is a good part time job, but wouldn't if you are looking to advance your career there all you get  is the run around from your store manager about why you wouldn't be good for the job you are applying for and that there are things that you need to improve on in your current role in order for you to be considered for other jobs and that they will follow up with you  in a few months. However the management never actually follows up with you, and when you try to follow up with them they make up more reasons why you aren't a good fit for that job."
good,there is nothing more to say the store and two assistant store managers were amazing even my three meat managers and two coworker were the absolute best kind of people
good,"Working at Sprouts is like going to Disneyland everyday. The people are fun and very graceful. The hardest part of the job is working with the refrigerator and freezer. It can get really cold in there. Other than that, I don't know if a job could get any easier!"
good,"This is a great place to work if you are a student or if you need extra cash and would like to work with great people As a courtesy clerk, my day basically consists of two major tasks; bagging groceries and gathering shopping carts. If I don't have anything else to do, I get little bags of courtesy ice, gather trash, stock up bathrooms, etc. I am currently learning how to be more punctual, as well as having learned how to operate the phone and intercom. Everyone who works there is always nice, happy, and friendly. It is a great environment to acquaint yourself with. The hardest part for me, like I said previously, is having to get up on time for my morning shifts.. Though the one thing I look forward to in my job is seeing my new coworker's faces and hearing what they want me to do for them while also showing them what I can do."
good,"easy going but productive people, schedule wasn't very flexible, when it came to advancement, communication between employees and supervisors could use some improvement as well."
good,"Typical day at Sprouts can get very busy, especially during sale days. I have learned I hope I never have to be gluten free. Management was a little rough at first but I believe it is turning around. The work place is all about healthy food and living. Nothing that difficult about the job. Most enjoyable for me is seeing that every person that goes through my line enjoyed it."
good,"Sprouts in Flagstaff was great. The employees were friendly, the environment was comfortable. The discount was decent, they always had food for the employees, and they took care of us like a team. Besides having to do carts in the snow, and having to close one day because of the rain, every day was enjoyable. (The location is Phoenix, on the other hand, was grim, they didn't smile as much, they didn't seem to feel like a family. Also, I had to sit in the parking lot and follow people for their carts because people had stolen them, and they tried to get me to go across the street to an apartment complex to retrieve them.)"
good,The management is a constant revolving door with different ideas that never coincide with each other leaving the store in chaos.  Many times employees could run better shifts than said management.
good,The management is very willing to work around you schedules. The employees are very nice and are willing to help you. The customers are interesting; you get to see a bunch of different people in the pursuit of a healthy life style.
good,A good entry level job that for college students going to school and receiving experience in retail. Each team member collaborated with each other to make the guests feel welcomed
good,Fun place to work for. They are flexible with hours. Hard place to move anywhere due to limited sections of the store. Pay is typical for this type of job.
good,"I actually really liked this job. The company knows customer service and hires competent people for the most part. The downside is, advancement is hard and when you do advance, the pay raises are very little. They care more about experience more so than loyalty to the company."
good,Long hours but inconsistent scheduling due to managers wants and needs. Overall positive experience. Kind co-workers and room to advance to head cashier if one stays a while.
good,"Fast paced Place, bus keep up with demands and Trends. Good overall working conditions. However the daily pace is very demanding. Has excellent benefits."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Sprouts, but since I had to make a move closer to family, I wanted to also make a change. Only reason that I wanted to make the change from Sprouts is because I have a passion in working fashion retail or hard goods retail."
good,"Friendly coworkers, strict company standards.  Corporate will often cut corners mainly by decreasing employee's hours. Insurance plans offered are bare bones policies"
good,Very well run store. Everyone got 40 hours and everyone got along pretty well. If you are looking for a good starting job sprouts is the way to go. You can make a decent career here if you work hard
good,I was opening meat cutter and assistant manager. pull old product and cut fresh meat and seafood. very good quality meat and seafood  also made sausage in shop.
good,It was a good place to work it just didn't give the hours I needed to support my family it was clean and easy work. People jath did work there were very nice.
good,"I worked at Sprouts for about a year during college. Great company to work for! I loved most of the people I worked with and enjoyed the culture of healthy living. I tried so many new fruits and vegetables while working there. The pay wasn't amazing but what I expected for a cashier position. Our store always seemed to be dead quiet or extremely busy, rarely anything in between. Like any customer service job, sometimes the customers where a nightmare. Overall, I would recommend to anyone looking for temporary or part-time work. I did seem like there are opportunities to move up. I was offered a position as head cashier but turned it down because the hours conflicted with school."
good,great customer service high organized events through out the years simples of different things we were selling assisting with other departments took phone calls
good,"Opening up a company branch was something i became apart of when i located this job. their standards were high and i could most definitely uphold them , with in  4 months of work, i have proceeded to promote myself to manager with a substantial small pay increase which required me to perform task non related, i strived for greatness and and almost accomplished, but didnt feel i was getting treated right. i  have always been one to love work, its what motivates me. and all i want to do is to find another employer i can motivate, and dedicate myself too."
good,"The pay is decent, and the people are fun. The regional managers enforced policies that increased work load without improving efficiency. Pay raises were fairly minor."
good,"Sprouts is a good first job and good for testing your skills at a entre level. Sprouts is very calm and stead paste job. With a weekly pay and minimal challenges, its a good job if your right out of high school or if your looking for weekly paying job."
good,"Everyday was something new. New products, new codes, new people, new stories. The people that work here are wonderful people and the managers care about their emplyees"
good,I loved interacting with all the customers.  Continuously encouraging coworkers to have fun while at work.  Making sure we were doing our best at meeting or beating our daily sales.  The most important thing I learned is that everyone is different in how you manage and encourage them.
good,Sprouts was my first job.  They hired me for the deli which was a good experience.  I was very shy and working in the deli slowly brought me out of my shell.  When the bakery clerks started quiting they moved me over to the bakery without actually taking me out of the deli. There were days where I was alone working both deli and bakery. After a while longer I moved to the front end as a cashier and later promoted to head cashier.  The turnover rate was always very high which led to scheduling issues and added stress.  The managers were always changing.  But over all it wasnt bad for a first job.
good,A day at Sprouts overall pretty simple. As a retail job there is a lot of customer interaction and keeping the store clean and organized. There is a little bit of sorting back-stock and moving product off of trucks but It's not the main focus. The management is accommodating and treat the people well.
good,"A typical work day was, usually, very busy (even on the slow days). What I liked, is that there was always something new to learn in that company. I, also, liked getting to know the regular customers that would visit on the daily or often. Management was very unorganized sometimes in the individual departments."
good,overall a good environment and company to work for. Was promised full time 40 hrs a week but due to poor store performance was cut to 32 hours a week.
good,"Very busy most of the time"
good,"Sprouts is a company coming into it's own against a growing number of health conscious stores. They provide a relaxed atmosphere, while maintaining a workable environment. Employees are only limited by their own drive, as opportunities continue to open."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of: interacting with customers, cleaning my work area, stocking shelves, assisting team members and customers to achieve store goals, handling both pleasant and difficult customers while keeping a level head."
good,"This is a very fast paced environment, constant growth, good people and a nice working environment. The best part of working for the company is the growth and being part of the action.  The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the growth. There is a great support team to help you along the way."
good,"I think what makes sprouts cool, and also hurts it is the customer service aspect sometimes it can become overwhelming for the new hires, which in effect harms the team. It causes the current employees to loath the weak link, better training would be a plus, instead of idk"
good,"For full time work days, bag customers groceries, help the elderly, and help customers find the right/similar product."
good,Great company to work with everyone is friendly and helpful. Cleaning and helping customer for any question and concern. I learned how to manage employees on duties for efficiencly for task and time management. Dealing with diffrent personallity type. I enjoy working with co-worker because they tought me how to work as a team and push each other for our best ability. Helping customer to discover diffrent type of fruits and vegetables and to educate them how ro choose the best fruit ready to eat.
good,a great company to work for and great customer. I learned all lot and was able to educate customer on healthy living and food choices.
good,"I enjoyed working there. The employees were friendly, as well as the customers. It isnt the highest paying job, but it's a great starting job."
good,It's an okay place to work. Friendly coworkers and environment to work. Love the fresh produce and meats that is sold. Plenty of room for growth.
good,"i love sprouts, the customers, the managers, and the employees. we work together as a team, not 1 day i don't feel like going to work. i love waking up every day knowing i have too. the most fun thing about the job is to help customers."
good,"Decent wages, if you're just starting out. "
good,This is a great job for teens. They are flexible with your schedule and will work around your personal life. They allow you to move around and experience different departments. They trust you to get your work done.
good,Great place to everyone from management on down were very nice people and were willing to work with you if you were having any problems.
good,"Very demanding workplace, only a person who wants to succeed and grow in there career will be great with this company. constantly changing every month, rules are only enforced when needed. Don't give changes,"
good,"There`s always a lot of people and usually people who don`t know what they want to buy.It`s always hard explaining every little thing to them,but it is at times rewarding.A lot of the management seems to be absent at times,but certain ones are good coordinators and hard workers."
good,This location that I am currently at seriously needs to hire more employees and give more hours.
good,Great company to work for and lots of potential for moving up. Management can be unorganized and difficult to put up with at times but overall work environment is awesome.
good,I learned quite a bit working for Sprouts Farmers Market.  A typical day at Sprouts was very full and non stop which was a good thing for me.  There was never a dull moment.  The hardest part of the job was sometimes the amount to do and the time allowed.  I always pulled it off but not without sacrifices.  The most enjoyable part of the job was how much I learned.  I got to work with many different people.  I was always proud to train somebody and also watch them grow and succeed.
good,Its a pretty great job if you were not required to work Sundays and Sundays are special days to me. The people are pretty cool and the managers care about what they do. It only sucks when you get mean customers and people who just like to make your job harder.
good,As a Produce Manager @ Sprouts I enjoyed the friendly atmosphere & the daily interactions with the customers.
good,the coworkers are great its a nice place to shop i like the costumers great prices on food i love getting paid every week the managers are fair.
good,"Working at Sunflower than transforming to Sprouts was a big change, but for the better. I loved how family oriented Sprouts was, yet so professional. Everyone is friendly and welcoming, customer service internally as well as externally is a big role within the company. I learned cashier positions, front end manager, some of produce, as well as stalking procedures. There is tons of room to grow within the company!"
good,I Work here full time if that says anything. Don't take on a position here expecting full time hours. Retail is too unpredictable to provide consistency.
good,"I haven't worked for the company for 4 years, but while employed it was a good company. They went through a lot of changes, all good, that helped the company grow."
good,"I had a great time working at sprouts, moved on to open a restaurant. Have tried to go back, new management. But was a great place to work. I was in receiving so I handled everything coming in and out of the store."
good,"Family friendly atmosphere with great coworkers and managers    "
good,"Interesting and complete g eat company with good benefits and always fair treatment , management service skilled and will always listen to issues or complaints"
good,The work environment is nothing to complain about but not too noteworthy.  Typical grocery store work vibes with an added sense of positivity and good customer experience.
good,We now have to buy our own gloves with less hours and poor raises. Additional work is always added without the pay. I’ve never worked for such a big company that day they make billions of dollars and seem so unorganized.
good,you'll get nicer customers than Safeway but yes policy is very heinous. a lot of shoppers shop there because they are extremely stingy. good hours though.
good,More time necessary on certain shifts. they didn't care enough about employees to make the necessary adjustments to finish the work. Overnight management was rude.
good,Had this job during high school and it was a great job just to get by with. Flexible hours with good management. Had reasonable pay for the position i was in.
good,Enjoyed working with new people who had unique lifestyles and as well as there individual work ethics. Never had such a great handful of co-workers that we all got along with each other. It was cool
good,"Very nice in the beginning I was on summer break, and got good hours for the first 2 weeks of opening (32 hours, 38 hours, 5 - 6 days a week) until I was dropped down to about 2 days, with 16 hours, and now, I have 1 day this whole week, at the time of writing this, that I can't even work (11:30AM - 7:30PM) because I'm in school. the pay is nice ($10/hr), but the fact that I barley get hours almost completely negates that. The saving grace are my co-workers, and team members who make things a lot of fun when I go to work, which makes time fly. The food is a little pricey, but I don't mind since they use high quality ingredients at the deli where I usually go. The team member discount is a huge help in buying food for me."
good,Fast paced management and ability to become a Leader through training and development. Culture can change from store to store but management invests in the future of the Team .
good,I usually enter work with a high self-esteem and ready. At Sprouts i learned that a busy environment still and always requires valued customers. The management at Sprouts Farmers Market needs to value the employee attitude and work environment. I Believe sprouts has no hard time working their but my most enjoyable part of my job is a satisfied customer.
good,"It's  a good  place  to work, but  the hours are changing  all the time, and getting  less,ok if you're  not  counting  on a certain amount of hours. Love the healthy products."
good,I loved working at Sprouts and made many friends as well as obtained skills within a working community. They provided me with opportunities for promotion.
good,"very labor intensive, group effort, must be willing to work together, schedule variety, many times you will be asked to stay extra time, must follow guidelines as far as clothing, hair, safety and health regulations. must be will to work HARD"
good,Fun place to work everyone is in a happy mood and excited for the next obstacle. We have fun and enjoy each other as well as the customers. Fun environment.
good,Been with the company 6 years overall company kept me busy taught me hard work how to manage products in a timely manner. The customer's were very sweet and genuine
good,As an order selector here you'll deal with a lot of produce. Lifting bags weighing up to 80 lbs. Retrieve merchandise and stack neatly onto a pallet for transport. Wasn't a bad job. It's pretty physically demanding though.
good,"Had a good time working with good people. Nice customers, good managers, I made good friends working there. Definitely check out. Lots of hard work and good people."
good,"I enjoyed working for Sprouts Farmers Market, the management would take care of anything I needed. My co workers were delightful and fun to work with and getting discounts on groceries was awesome."
good,we would have a list of what needed to be produced for the day. making green salads all the time along with helping customers made my shifts fly by. I learned to work smarter and not harder
good,"I enjoyed working for Sprouts. Met and learned from a lot of people. Needed to pay better and have pay raises more often than once a year. Needed better training for new employees. Your first day they expect you to know how to do everything, can be stressful."
good,"did not provide good hours"
good,"I loved it and it is fun and stressful. The customer can be cool and suck at the same time. I love the work, the customers can be very lazy at times. The environment is very modern and safe. Everyone has your back just as long as you work hard."
good,I have learned to manage my time and to be a support for our team. Things can get crazy but with the support of your fellow team members anything is possible. You meet a great team and the customers are enjoyable.
good,"Overall Sprouts is a decent company to work for. They do offer good benefits and treat their employees well. There are different departments throughout the store that offer employment. As any customer related job, there will be days where frustrations occur."
good,"Not much to say other than, you gotta try to like it or not. I tried it and learned the meat business of Sprouts and learned that I wanted to learn more."
good,"I typically like my job, I excel in customer service. The management is so/so at my location. I always walk in the door with a positive attitude, and leave 80% of the time with a positive attitude. "
good,The shifts were very physical work. There was sometime struggles with management as there was often inconsistency in what was expected of employees on a daily Basis.
good,I love working here cause its like a family to me. I work two jobs and Id rather be in this environment then the other. Very friendly and hard working people
good,"is nice place to work, fare for all employees but most of the emploryees we need full time and more beneficies..."
good,"Overall Sprouts has been a really fun place to work. Unfortunately when business slowed way down after grand opening and on for the past 6 months, hours decreased dramatically."
good,"I worked at two Sprouts Farmers Markets, one was great, it was relaxed, all the employees and managers were nice and helpful and they listened to my availability. I worked there for a year and a half. Occasionally a negative manager would be hired (which made my life  more difficult sometimes). However overall I loved that Sprouts. However once I transferred the new Sprouts took far longer than it was supposed to to implement me into their system, completely ignored my availability, and tried to put me into a position I was highly uncomfortable with. Not to mention they often scheduled me the day of and called me telling me that I needed to work in less than 30 minutes. Needless to say I made sure that I did not work there for long."
good,"I worked in the bakery as a morning baker mostly. early morning hours. My job was to pull shrink, bake bread and pastry before a certain time.  Good part about my day was i worked with cool individuals that i called friends after getting to know them and i got to go home early haha. Bad part about working in the bakery was having to be there at 3am.  Most enjoyable part of my day was helping customer find what they were looking for and making there day that much better, It would put a smile on my face. I love helping people out. The managers were always on top of whats going on in every department. No discrimination, I've seen lots of people come and go wasn't because the job sucked it just ended up being to much for them to handle, its not for everybody."
good,Enjoy working there but when I was hired I was told it would be full time and it turns out it was not.  I've been lucky that I have worked at least 30 hours a week but not any more
good,A good place to work if you're in high school or looking for something different in a job. People who work there are some of the best that I have ever met.
good,The environment there is great and the other employees are very friendly. This job is a fast paced and stressful job though. You are constantly running around and cleaning. Overall a good first job.
good,"low work, low pay. not going to be making any money unless in management and even then its probably half decent. if you want a nice easy going job for a little extra cash id recommend here."
good,"Worked the graveyard shift so it was pretty awesome."
good,"Sprouts is a pretty great place to work, usually. It's a good company, but a lot depends on the managers of the store. But the pay is generally good, hours are usually available, and the people are usually chill."
good,"Sprouts is a great place to work. It is a clean, safe, and overall positive environment to work in. In my department we had a lack of staffing which made is hard to complete all the duties. There was always a lot of work to be done because there was a limited amount of people scheduled in a day. For me the work load was too much on my body but the overall tasks were not difficult and the pay was decent."
good,"Good place to work, chance for advancement.Supervisors are easy going and co-workers are one of a kind. If you need to work extra hours they are more than happy to accommodate."
good,"I learned about Cooperate Company Structures and Operations. "
good,Generally a pleasant work environment. Team members try helping one another. Department supervisors and store managers usually are available for questions or help.
good,"A pleasant and positive work place, the management is fair and understanding of life situations. i have absolutely no complants about the job, work place, or people in this company."
good,"Work to me means always staying busy during all times of the day. Weather it be slow, perfect time to catch up on cleaning, restocking or helping other departments with small tasks. I love that I can do all of this and more at this job."
good,Is a fun environment with fun coworkers but the compensation is on the low end for department employees because of the minimum wage increase. I'm only getting paid about 12 cents over courtesy clerks as a produce/dairy clerk.
good,"Loved working for Sprouts! The team is very close, and everyone really does work together to make sure everything in the store flows perfectly. I really recommend working at Sprouts to anyone who loves working with a great team of people and wonderful customers!"
good,"They have high standards of their stores and their employees are expected to uphold that vision. Workplace was a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and I'd work there again in a heartbeat."
good,working at sprouts taught me how real customer service skills.
good,"I loved my job at Sprouts, it was one of the best I've had with the exception of my hours being cut down to 15 per week. I would return tom work there if I could have a full time position."
good,"great job, you get out what you put in. I learned that its not about the ""what"" but more the ""why"". getting the team to buy in for a common goal. protecting and building the brand is very important. Hardest part of the job for me was finding that work life balance, which may not be true for others."
good,A typical work day consisted of deliveries and helping other departments if needed. I learned other departments and learning what the different departments needed to succeed to give the customer the best experience shopping at our store. The workplace culture was to help coworkers as needed. The hardest part about the job was learning what the different managers wanted or expected as we were a training store for managers.The most enjoyable part was the coworkers and the learning experiences you received with working with the different departments.
good,"Lone priods of time standing up "
good,"I enjoyed the company and job. Would definitely work for them again. However, they need to make sure that store managers and people in corporate are not in relations with each other. When I had a problem with my manager, there was no one I could go to, because her partner works in the corporate office and I didn't think my voice would be heard."
good,It was my temporary job. One of the supervisors was not very nice. Kind of racist. She is not there anymore. Good for the rest of employees. I am quity happy after I change my job to King Soopers.
good,"Pretty laid back environment, a good place to work. Good management, decent hours, decent pay, great customers. Pretty good customer service training."
good,"Some days were longer, some were shorter. I liked working here. It was a new experience for me and I am glad I had the chance to experience it. I liked my co-workers, they were all kind."
good,Cashier customer service rang up orders cleand on and around register balance drawer packed orders answerd qustions when needed stocked shelves  provided great customer service
good,The company seems to notice hard work and compensates fairly. Hours are flexible and managers are understanding of needs. Great 15% off everything discount for all employees and their families.
good,I did not work here for very long. I dont know what to say about this place. It was not my kind of job. I was ready to find something new very quickly here.
good,"It was a good place to work to learn how to do cashiering. I made some great friends with my co workers. I was there for a while so I saw a lot of turn over, but my co workers were great."
good,"A typical day for a courtesy clerk is helping customers located things, retrieve carts, go-backs, keeping the store and restrooms clean, offer carry-out. "
good,"Its a great place to work at, its a fast pace heavy customer service. Put if your look to move up in title good luck! They make promise that are never meant."
good,I enjoyed my time with Sprouts. I feel that this is where I gained many of my customer service skills and I had the opportunity to cross train in other departments which kept the work interesting. Had I chosen to stay I believe that I would have been able to advance.
good,Great place to work at for a college student for their first job. You learn lots of things about food and also taste different type of food while eating healthy.
good,"This is a very fast paced environment and is a great opportunity for the right people."
good,You meet a lot of interesting people. There is always a lot to learn and try. It's fast paced and fun. There is a variety of things to do everyday. Locations are well placed.
good,"nice environment to work in and they work with your schedule, brakes where always on time. Nice Management you could go to them anytime if you had a problem."
good,"This is a good company to work for. These types of stores  (natural grocery chains) tend to have needy Customers. Depending where you're at, favoritism happens. Pretty laid back atmosphere where many take advantage of. It's a good place to work, with opportunity if you WORK for it."
good,"While it didn't last long, because of the fact that it was a retail job, and those aren't exactly my ""type"", it was a better job. better, if only due to the fact that i had fixed hours, instead of being on-call. the only problem was why i was hired as well as the time of year i was hired-- Late February to early March, which in Texas, isn't as bad as Illinois, but can still get cold. add that to the fact that i never had a moment to sit  except during a fifteen minute break twice a day and for lunch, and it's an okay job. not great, but okay."
good,"Working was simple and repetitive. Very relaxed environment for job where customer satisfaction is priority. The most enjoyable part of the job was stepping into the cooler to get products, because of coming from a construction job. Days got hot outside so in the cooler was always a good feeling."
good,"A typical day would be serving the customers needs and making sure customers are getting quality service, along with make sure they get what is needed. What I have learned is showing customer service shows a lot of character. and the hardest is shipment when it comes and enjoyable is meeting different types of people."
good,Usually busy. I learned a lot about customer service skills. Management is very friendly. Work place is usually very fun and is productive. The hardest part of the job is the stress when busy and dealing with grumpy customers.
good,Only worked at 1 store location but management changed out every year. It was filled with great co workers from high school kids to people in their 50s. They treat you well. Breaks and lunches for everyone including cashiers. Every 6 months they hold a free food and entertainment for most of the day in the back.
good,"Sprouts is a very good company,owned by very generous and respectable people,sprouts is a very clean workplace in every aspect,All employees are very respectful an also helpful."
good,"Great pay, great working environment, mangers will help you with your schedule, and there are plenty of learning opportunities. The staff will look out for you the best way they can if you have questions."
good,"Fast pace and lots of energy, always something to do. Daily deals on fresh and organic items to be proud of. Lots of new healthy ideas and ingredients to create delicious meals daily for your family."
good,"Working in the deli takes a lot of knowledge, you have to learn how to prepare lots of meals and know all kinds of cheeses and meats. It can be overwhelming, but if you're around the right kind of people, the job shouldn't be too bad."
good,"I like the company and the culture and my store management team is great! My department co workers are great to work with as well"
good,It was a great place to work. Flexible and the company was an awesome place to work. It allow me to showcase my talent and share my knowledge with others
good,No complaints all the people I worked with were great. I learned a lot about the logistics or running a commercial retail business. The uniform is relaxed.
good,"There's always something to do, co-workers make it a fun work place and enjoyable. I've learned how to occupy my time if the day is  somewhat slow in the front end."
good,Sprouts offers upward mobility and career opportunities. It is a fun and fast paced working environment with great benefits. The company programs are constantly changing and being streamlined to keep up with our rapidly advancing and competitive technological society so you must be a fast learner and willing to constantly learn new things and change processes. The company's focus is on healthy living and making healthier options accessible and affordable to all commnunities.
good,"Great market to purchase fresh produce,high quality meats,and poultry."
good,"good people and friendly work environment at sprouts in elk grove.  i worked for the company because of my interest in natural foods that help promote a healthy lifestyle. the job was fun when working with the right colleagues and under the proper management, but the constant shuffling of superior managers made scheduling unstable and led to my voluntary adieu from the company."
good,my working experience was really good. people are approachable and helped me grow as an employee and as a person. i could say that i learned a lot specially in the field of customer service
good,goood environment to work...customers very nice made it a great experience to display great customer service...managers were cool willing to help out departments
good,A typical day at work consists of meal preparation and customer service. It makes the day go fast when it is super busy. Can become overwhelming for some. There is always something to do. There are slow days and these days can drag. Overall a good place to work if you have goals to move up within the company.
good,It was a great place to work. Management was very nice and flexible. Being in school at the time they understood that school came first and worked around my schedule.
good,Excellent source of accomplishment and a driven hardworking team structure. Valuable required access to customer service experience. Implicate understanding of store operations.
good,I loved the people I worked with but the management there wasn't all that great. There was often miscommunication between managers and workers. Other than that managers were understanding and were flexible with hours.
good,"Fun environment and great crew and management to work with. Biggest complaint would be poor compensation in comparison to other similar companies such as Trader Joe's and Whole Foods who start off around $12 starting, not minimum wage.Great opportunities for advancement."
good,"Hours and company management were in compliance. Employees has access to all resources to human resources, benefits, abs anything else through employee portal online. Work and hours are very suitable."
good,"A normal day at work would be doing the break out which was always pretty calm.I learned many things like baking bread and handling certain foods. Everyone in the work place is nice and fun. The whole store itself was pretty fun with different people from all sorts of places. The hardest part would likely be to finish on time, everyday it was always different amounts of things. My co workers were probably the most enjoyable part, everyone was always so bubbly."
good,I have enjoyed working at Sprouts. Management is always there to help you. The hardest part of this job was having to be there at 4 am every shift.
good,Would be helping customers bagging groceries or showing them around. Gathering carts through out the day. Also would help clean around the store. What I had learned was to be patient with customers and listen to what they are asking. And work together with employees and help anyone who looks like they need help. My managers and coworkers were always helpful and taught me things I needed to know. The hardest part of the job was helping in the front when it was busy and trying to bag groceries and get carts when there was none. The most enjoyable was always making someone smile when it looks like they were having a bad day.
good,"Opened area of work, baked all necessary times, counted inventory, made sure are items are in date, kept are clean at all times, used safety precautions"
good,"The work is very hard, physically and mentally... But it's taught me a lot about how to manage more effectively, and shown me the rewards of sticking with something so challenging. I'm very proud of what I'm able to contribute. In-store management consists of a strong core of kind, hard-working and supportive individuals. I'm truly honored to be a part of such a magnificent team of people."
good,"I loved working there, It was sad that i had to move away. I loved that you could wear jeans to work and the Sprouts shirts (which I still have one somewhere). Plus the last rule that we had to follow was ""Rule number 8: Have Fun"", That rule made it it worth while to go to work."
good,"It's a job that opinions differ on, apparently on store location. I personally think its fresh, and full of life. It's easier to get into healthy living habits due to working there, there are many flavors of customers."
good,"• Order and receive meat products, take inventory."
good,"Sprouts was a cool place to work for. I got to work practically every department, and learn almost the whole store. I made some really great friends. This was my first job, so I'll admit I made some mistakes, but i definitely learned from them."
good,"I enjoy interacting with all of the Team Members and Customers on a daily basis.  I enjoy getting to know the Stores' Layout and anticipate a big Grand Opening Day soon."
good,"Sprouts is a fast passed environment that can be friendly and outgoing.  The staff does have a high turn around, but there is always something that needs to be done."
good,"A typical day is fast paced, walking departments making sure all departments are ready for business.I learned how to manage people and help there departments become more profitable. My co-workers are happy hard working and haveing fun. The hardest part of the job is trying to look perfect for company. thr most enjoyable part of the job is working with customers."
good,Sprouts Farmers Market is a fast pace store. The co-workers make it a fun place to work. Management is easy to get along with.
good,"I jump on the cash register, start scanning customers' items, and tell them to have a great day. The regular customers and I always have something to talk about, whether it be regarding something going on in their life, or my life, and we always have great conversations. I've learned many produce item codes and have memorized them and my co-workers are amazing. The hardest part of my job is dealing with rude customers, but I always help them the best way I can. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing my regular customers and having the conversations we have."
good,It was a great place to work at and there was always something to do. The grand opening was fast paced and hectic but it calmed down after a week.
good,"Working at sprouts was a good first job. We had to learn things quickly, as it was a new location! Although it was rough at times it made things interesting and kept us busy as opposed to just doing little jobs to keep us busy. I enjoyed being able to help the customers and learn about different food items or health items the store provides. Sprouts holds a friendly environment and the staff were all supportive of each other, even though at times some did not see eye to eye. Working here helped me to learn to work as a team but also to manage myself in a way that is efficient and productive."
good,I enjoy working here. The people I work with are very nice and we all look out for each other. Its very rare to find a work place like that.
good,sprouts is a great place to work. only downside is if there arent any hours. its gets hectic. if the store is slow they will cut your hours.
good,"Positive place. Wish I could have stayed longer. Coworkers were positive, managers were on point. Overall well organized company."
good,Being a cashier is rewarding yet challenging. Fun environment with great employees and the managers are pretty outgoing as well. The most enjoyable part of my job is becoming close with my regular customers and getting to know them one on one just coming into the workplace daily. The challenging part is making sure you are on your game giving and receiving the right amount of money to keep your drawer on the amount of money you should have.
good,"Every day is good at Sprouts. The work environment is very open and I have definitely learned some very good customer service skills over the past few years. In vitamins I learned so much I can practically become a doctor (not really, but still a lot). The people are definitely the best part of the job."
good,Great place to work while going to school. Work life balance. Management and store environment is excellent. Room to learn about different departments. Not much room for advancement in this company.
good,very busy place to work. it is very fast pace which helps me to be good in managing my time. have to be multi tasking to work at sprouts
good,"Great place to shop and work. Its the most fun and enjoyable place to work, everyone is so friendly, co-workers are so awesome."
good,"Everyone has been great at this company, and it is a very welcoming environment to work in. I would recommend Sprouts to anyone who wants to start out in Grocery."
good,"Performed excellent customer service skills while providing basic understanding of vitamins, herbs, and supplements to better assist customers. Routine weekly invoicing, vendor ordering, and vendor return processing. Professional shelving, stocking, and facing of entire department. Adequate knowledge of proper opening and closing procedures of the entire Vitamin department."
good,"work is very busy great hours."
good,"customers great,most coworkers were good,I feel management did the best they could"
good,Customer service. Store opening and closing procedures. Assisted cashiering.
good,"Overall Sprouts is a well put together company. You definitely get to create a friendly relationship with regular customers. I learned how to improve my communication skills, and how to increase my awareness and attention to my surroundings and duties, Management and other employees are comforting and fun to work with it is a very warm environment. Sprouts employees are like a little family."
good,"I either open or close, I have to make sure the store is ready to open that the front end looks great, and when closing I make sure the store is ready for the next day, there is responsibly in closing since I have make sure I do my audits to cashiers, make my sweeps ( collect deposits form register) and count all nine tills and balance them with the manager's till, to make the final deposits for the day, and leave all tills with the money ready for the next day."
good,"Everyday I come into work, I am always greeted with fellow hellos head nods from fellow coworkers. At Sprouts, everyone knows and respects each other and we all have a small invisible bond that makes working so much easier because everyone is easy to approach and converse with. Management is always easy to talk with and are active helpers that ensure our store departments are always up and organized and stocked."
good,A good company to work for. Could improve on having 2 employees on the closing shifts. Maybe have now. I had great customer interaction. I like how maintenance improved .
good,"A typical work day was just stocking the shelves, and returning to the back to grab more items to keep on stocking the shelves and so on. Also helping people find what they need and cleaning up things that sometimes customers would spill etc The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy items. Best part of the job was talking to the nice people who worked there."
good,typical day at sprouts in Deli is first by cooking the rotisserie chickens. Next we begin making sandwiches and meals along with helping customer. Later in the afternoon we start cleaning and sanitizing all Deli slicers and equipment followed by  cleaning and cooking logs.
good,Great place to work at. The management team is wonderful and so are the employees. The customers that come in will really get to know you because most of the customers are regulars.
good,"Good job, good pay. Enjoyed the job. Didn't enjoy the lack of my manager direction. Supervisors were wonderful, very helpful. The work place culture is diverse and fantastic."
good,Sprouts is a growing company that offers benefits for part time employees. You have employee discounts. You're able to transfer to any sprouts in the U.S. base on opening positions. They is opportunity for growth. I live in Southern California pay doesn't compensate for the cost of living.
good,"It's heavy lifting warehouse work. You have to be able to keep up a good speed throughout the whole day and hit the numbers you're supposed to for speed, accuracy, etc. This is difficult, but not impossible. They aren't constantly up your butt about it, but they will occasionally let you know if you're not moving fast enough."
good,I love the job and people but I seem to be in a position with not much advancement. I would like to find something closer to home with advancement opportunities.
good,"Loved getting 15% grocery discounts. However, I wasn't interested in advancing to different departments beacuse it was low pay raise. Breaks were sometimes delayed. Overall, just felt overqualified for the job."
good,"The people were all nice and I never got bored there. I would get to work, and start working on whatever clearly needed to be done, whether that was getting carts, sweeping the store, or mopping the bathrooms. My favorite part was the freedom to go outside and get carts. Fresh air is much appreciated when having to deal with customers in the bagging area."
good,Very average job. Pays well for what you do. Management seems to rotate every six months or so. The location I worked at was pretty busy and the customers tend to be rude.
good,"Of all the food service places I've worked, this one provides the best of all the aspects of that sort of job. Pay was good, hours were right, and management was very approachable. It is still a part-time food service job, so it's not something for anyone who wants more than just renting a small apartment while in college. However, if you work in management then it is more career. The job does a lot of the policy training through a computer application, and was very asinine at times."
good,"Great place to work at. Good pay and good people.   The people here care about what we do, and aim to do what's right for the customer and for each other. I don't mind working hard and I appreciate that the people around me are working hard too."
good,"I started with Sprouts when they first opened the Broken Arrow store.  The environment was super at first with the manager we had.  It changed very quickly when new management was brought in.  During slow times we were expected to look busy - cleaning, straightening.  This became my main work in the store, cleaning throughout the different departments"
good,I like everything offered by Sprouts.  It is a very relaxed environment with great people to work with.  They care about the mission statement and work hard to engage their employees.
good,"Great place to work, interesting goods and good culture. The customer were fun and enjoyable. good training and my management staff was positive and helpful."
good,I was trained as a cashier and assist customers for products and helped out in other departments when needed. Enjoyed my job very much!! I learned all the codes for the produce department. I am a very quick cashier. I did demos for products as well in store
good,Nice employees but bad management  no training in deli department.  Very short staffed. Your basically running around all day. But it does make your day go by quickly.
good,"this job feels as if you are working with your family threwout the day."
good,The people sprouts hire are awesome. They are generally good humored and like to make it a stress-free environment. I will say that some management like to play favorites but it's not THAT bad. Overall I'd recommend sprouts to anyone who likes interacting with people.
good,The company was great to work for. The atmosphere was fun and quick paced. The work was very repetitive and acquired attention to detail. Managers did not micro manage but expected to job to be done
good,"coming in setting up the deli department, rotating produce, checking back room inventory, making sure dishes are washed, making sure all cleaning is perfect, cooking rotisserie, morning store meetings"
good,Nice coworkers. If you work hard you will stand out. Pay isn't competitive but it's a fairly new company and they are trying to correct pay issues. 
good,"Working at Sprouts is great, typical retail, there is always something to do. You get a 15% discount on your total bill which is very nice!  Typical benefits, not very affordable."
good,"Sprouts is an overal good company to work for, the only downside is you often get people who only care about creating drama. It's a busy place so you must be quick on your feet"
good,"Working for sprouts  was a fun place to be around , everyone was very friendly and relatively things moved smoothly. I would recommend applying there."
good,"Sprouts has been a good experience so far, with a lot of the managers actually working with other people to make  it a good experience for both the worker and the customer."
good,"Been working at Sprouts for just about 3 years now, and it has been quite the experience. The work day can either be slow or busy depending on the day, and you can make the day enjoyable just by talking with your coworkers who you quickly build a bond with. Management is decent, the workplace is simple, and you learn quite a bit when you are working for the store. I have hopped around into at least 5 departments because of my willingness to learn, and have received pay raises because of it. All in all, this job definitely beats working the drive-thru of a fast food chain."
good,This is by far one of the best employers I have worked for. However there have been some company decisions that have brought it downhill. Management is great. But Corporate is going to bring this place downhill.
good,"a very friendly environment, the customer always came first. Management made sure you knew what you needed to do and expected you to come in and work har, as long as you did your job it was really easy to advance"
good,"Simple, easy, yet motivating.  Good incentives and good pay structure.  Have a home there if I need it.  Learned lots about Maca powder, etc. because of our amazing vitamins department."
good,"Sometimes you work really hard because you want to do your best for the customer because you really care to do your job well, but I don't believe that really hard work gets monetarily incentivised, so in a few months, you begin to slack a bit, the store starts running out of things you need to do your job, you start doing closing/opening/sweeping duties to get out of bagging because bagging is really repetitive and, honestly, it's a process one does automatically. I guess I was really tired of bagging and pushing carts all through the hot Arizona summer, but I'm glad I made some people's lives better by making accessible a healthier lifestyle Sprouts provides and I'm glad I made my Sprouts friends. The people who work there are truly awesome, and they are often the ones who get you through the day."
good,"Sprouts was a great place to work! Great benefits, great coworkers, very fun and positive environment! I thoroughly enjoyed working here while I went to JCCC. They very much worked with students to create a schedule that suits your needs."
good,"This jobs provides sufficient breaks to allow breathing room and addresses any problems to keep employees happy. They believe if the employee is happy, then customers will be happy which creates a great work atmosphere."
good,"Anything from stocking shelves, sweeping floors, bagging groceries, cutting/ packaging meat, and cleaning restroom. Retrieving produce and meats from the freezer was the least enjoyable part of the job. Most enjoyable part of  this job is that, you aren't in the same section of the store everyday. You rotate to different parts of the store throughout the day."
good,"I love my job as a vitamin clerk, I enjoy my job because I know I want to help others as a natural healer in my future and working in the vitamin department is a great stepping stool for me. I am grateful and appreciative because I do not have the knowledge that is typically required for this position, but I work hard and am very eager to know more and more everyday. There is always so much to learn, there are over 8,000 products. My co-workers are amazing and so knowledgeable. Before I was promoted to the vitamin department I was a courtesy clerk."
good,"I loved working there for the time I was there, there was something about the customers and the workers that just made it a fun experience over all. I struggled with doing load shipments we would get twice a week, but I overcame that hurdle as soon as I got the hang of it. Everyday I'd come in and get greeted by everyone near my department. I loved coming to work there when I did."
good,A store and company that prides itself on giving employees the tools and resources necessary to advance within the company.
good,"Sprouts Farmers Market is an up and coming company, going threw a lot of transitions. fun work environment. management has not been the most stable,9 store managers in the last 4 years. best part of job is the team environment and good atmosphere. the hardest part of job was the constant change."
good,"Sprouts promotes an excellent customer service and offers great products at lower prices than its competitors, allowing customers to shop for more of what they love."
good,"A typical day consists of different responsibilities based on what time I am scheduled. I learned what it takes to run and manage a department. I have learned how to deal with customers and how to manage work relationships even when disagreements arise. The hardest part of my job would have to be the cleaning which is also the dirtiest part of my job. However, I do enjoy working with my fellow employees and the close friendships I have built over the years."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of clocking in, counting my till to make sure all the money I was starting off with was in tact and then set out to find where I was going to be placed for the time being. I would come in, greet my fellow co-workers and then get straight to work assisting the next customer who needed to be checked out. I learned a lot about the products that we carried in the store and am grateful because they were essential items that I could use throughout my life to ensure a better health state. Management was always helpful and willing to answer any questions or inquiries that I had. My co-wrokers were what made the days go by faster. Fun, young and ready to work. The hardest part of the job was probably having to remember all the codes in the beginning but after getting them memorized it made things go by a lot more swimmingly. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the association with customers, hearing about their days and also learning different uses for the products they were purchasing was definitely a beneificial highlight."
good,Great place to work. I learned a lot about different business aspects. Management cared about employees as much as they did their business. Co-workers are fun and most you can easily call friends.
good,"Sprouts Farmers Market is a great place to be and be part of! As another retail company, customer service is number one key to make grow up as a company; the company empowers employees to provide customer satisfaction and make all guests happy. I have learned to communicate better with team members and  customers, listen coworkers, be a better leader and cooperate with others. I enjoy working here for its culture, ideas, programs and team work environment."
good,"Worked wet rack and dry tables. worked pallet jacks, stocked backroom, safety person of the month, above target reviews for 4 years."
good,"During a typical day of work, I would clock in, go to the parking lot to clear carts and come back in to bag groceries. In addition, I would take a small break from bagging and switch between cleaning the bathrooms and sweeping the store. If customers came to me with questions, I would help them in any way I could."
good,"Made sure employees got paid correctly, balanced all cash on hand of up to $10,000, made sure invoices got paid, placed supply orders, did new hire process as well as I9s, process terminations, in charge of attendance and write ups for violations"
good,Good place to work learned a lot would still be there if I wouldn’t have a personal life changing injury to my foot the people and customers were great there
good,"The management was friendly, very easy to talk to and almost always available with their open door policy. The atmosphere was friendly and everyone was great to work with. The only issue I had was there simply weren't enough hours given to me to be able to stay."
good,I enjoyed the people and expectations of my job. Sprouts is a large company with ability to move up the corperate ladder. The job was not physically straining.
good,it was over all a very good job but lack of good management. very quick if you kept busy and the pay is very reasonable for almost easy to no work. worth it.
good,To start off my day I like to double check the night clerks work before I start to make sure everything that is required is done.
good,I love the store. Really big. Not for everyday foods. It’s for healthy people. I cleaned a lot. Great juice bar and deli and protein bars. I love the beer.
good,"work is not that hard or stressful, great co-workers"
good,Great company that does well maintaining their employees and takes good care of their customers. Sprouts is much better to work for then your typical grocery store.
good,Fun and friendly work environment. A very busy store that functions on teamwork and everyone is willing to help you out and also make the customer happy. Management does shift often making it hard to keep relationships with them and sometimes it can be hard to maintain decent work hours because they cut hours randomly due to budgets. There is room for growth depending on the department you work in and your work ethic.
good,"Sprouts s a pretty good place to work most of the time. Hard workers that show up & do a good job can move up.  Managers get moved around every year or two which can be good or bad. Some managers only focus on sales and seems like thats it, Sometimes they can really cut hrs and that can be stressful for some. Sometimes they put stress on the employees because they cut your hrs but still expect you to get the same amount of work done."
good,"As assistant manager of the bulk department, I monitored the inventory of over 300 products. I kept shelves stocked and minimized out of stocks. I streamlined the ordering process within my department and improved sales per capita, significantly, compared to last year. My department was often understaffed. As a result, I worked quickly and efficiently to ensure customers had products. "
good,"Constantly busy with plenty to do, always keeping pace with customers and their needs. Learned a lot of time management and good communication skills and habits. Management was very flexible and understanding with a great attitude and genuinely cared how a person was doing and how they could help with that."
good,"Some days can be slow and relaxing, others are busy and quick-paced. I learned a lot about vitamins and customer serve while working there. Management was great for the most part. Sometimes it was hard to reduce my hours when school got busy because our department was small. The best part about working there was my coworkers. It was like a big family."
good,"Coworkers were friendly and helpful, management tried to make sure every employee was happy there. Hours were reasonable. There were also opportunities to move up in the company as well"
good,"For the amount of time I worked for Sprouts it was rewarding to certain point, but I needed more mental stimulation.  Working for Sprouts was fun!  I enjoyed the employees and the customers.  I loved teaching customers about eating healthy. The vendors were very generous with employee samples, so we could try their products in order to sale them to customers."
good,"Overall my job is pretty easy. As a cutter most of the time my job schedule is already laid out and i simply have to complete a list of tasks given to me. Grocery retail in general can be very fast-paced, especially around any holiday. The biggest struggle is finding the balance to keep the customers, but also my team, happy."
good,good place to work very friendly staff. I would like to find another jo Why do I have to do this.  Is it cold outside. I am very hungry and would love to go to sleep
good,"A great place to work if you enjoy working with the public.  Its a growing company, and there is lots of opportunity to move up within the organization."
good,"I've been working for Sprouts as a grocery clerk for a little over a year now, and I can say of the three retail companies I've worked for, this one has been the best experience for me. I wasn't the best when I started, but my managers worked with me to help me develop into one of the top performing clerks in the department. It helps that being the only person with open availability in the ""clerk"" level earns me the most hours as well. The manager who does my schedule is usually pretty open to requests as well, if someone lets her know ahead of time, she'll usually grant it. The only issues I've honestly had here are more superficial. When it gets really busy, we'll get called up to help bag because there aren't anywhere near enough courtesy clerks scheduled, the ones they DO have tend to be lazy and unmotivated. But they aren't getting many hours, so it's understandable to an extent. The ones that do work usually get placed into a department. The managers have all really been friendly, at least towards me, so I have no complaints there either. As for the hardest part of the job in grocery, we tend to get a large load in, and the team is expected to work as much of it as we can during the day, while maintaining good store condition amidst the busy crowd. Management arranges for an ""employee appreciation"" party once every couple of months wherein they provide us free food and an additional discount on purchases all day as well."
good,"While I was working at Sprouts, I learned about the ins and outs of retail and providing various services to customers. My managers and co-workers are reasonable and just and help me out when I needed it. I love making people happy by helping them carrying groceries to their vehicle or finding something they need."
good,Very multi-cultural atmosphere! Work was always very attentive and busy. Great opportunities to advance and move up. Many different departments to learn and engage with.
good,"A typical day at work consists of stocking produce cleaning the department and helping customer with anything they need in the store. I've learned so much much on the job about the different things in the store over the year with help from customers and other associates as well. Management is good, they seem to care and listen to problems to help you solve them. The co-workers on the other hand just depend because sprouts will almost hire anybody that applies so i have to work with a lot of different people over the course of the job. The hardest part of the job is not having enough help when it is needed on the busier days. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and the other employees."
good,A typical day is very busy day. I work at the number one Sprouts in the world. The front-end is very busy. Managers occupied all the time. Co-workers are very nice and polite. Its an awesome environment to work in.
good,"A typical day was filled with running groceries out to cars for customers, putting away what customers didn't want, helping located what the customer wanted and keeping the parking lot organized. I didn't really learn anything new that I already knew. The management had an open door policy so it made it very easy to talk to the managers. The hardest part of my job was when I would have to organize the parking lot in harsh weather. I enjoy the constant movement and activity."
good,"Upon hiring , they were great with response timing. very Swift with paperwork and gets you in and trained promptly.Their marketing sales and promotions are well thought out and easy to follow. They expect nothing but the true version of yourselves, get there on time and if you're early lets get to prepping. if you're looking for a  foundation for the future,Sprouts are definitely the work spot to grow and Sprout! You must be clear minded at all times because Sprouts is already in order before your apply lol so what they teach you is educational but after those training days you mush show them action after the training wheels. This is where you begin a new name , not the name you where born with but the name you're making for yourself as you represent Sprouts, they are more than a ""job"" this could be a great support system for the future if you apply now. and yes they are always acknowledging progression which majority companies lack from employee to management but at Sprouts, here you can be the best versions of ""Sprouts 2.You"""
good,"very flexable as long as you are very hard too keep up with everything they give you as a task but if you are determined, hard working, and keep a positive attitude you will have no problem"
good,I have worked here for 5 years I really enjoy it however at this time i feel i am ready for more advancement and more opportunity. It really is a Great place to work we are like family here.
good,I would definitely not mind recommending this job to a friend great atmosphere and amazing employees.The managers are great and really care about their employees.
good,"Was a fun place to work, The discount wasn't horrible but could've been better. I wish that the managers would've been easier to work with on requesting vacations"
good,"great workplace culture, enjoyed being around all of the employees. Worked well with management. Was offered higher management with the condition that my availability was 100%, even while being at College."
good,"Sprouts was an amazing experience, everything about my job was fun. From working with customers to ordering my department. I eventually took a job with higher pay but if I ever found myself unemployed I would go back to Sprouts."
good,"Since we've partnerded with amazon the demand grew tremendously, but never something I couldn't handle. Such a fun environment. Friendships with customers who I've known for years because they constantly come back shopping. I learned a lot when I got promoted to management such as time management, scheduling, receiving invoices as well as orders.  Customer service is something I've worked with for seven years. I'm all about pleasing our customers."
good,"Sprouts Farmers Market is a great place for me to build my customer service skills, communicate openly with management, and work as a team to get tasks completed. There has been advancement opportunities in this company, but I was focusing on school so it's good to know they appreciate hard work."
good,"My experience working at sprouts have been a fun filled learning experience. I have grown my customer service, hospitality and customer care experience since I joined the Sprouts family."
good,"My typical day would be to clock in and go right into checking out peoples groceries. I would do this until a manager would ask me to go get shopping carts and bring them in. When my shift was over, which was usually at closing, I would clean all the registers and counters, sweep the full area and restock all the refrigerators in the front area. "
good,"Being able to go straight to work and have a daily goal of stocking/ cleaning the department. Learned how properly manage time to complete daily work goals. Management would check department at least once a day which would allow me to feel comfortable enough to complete all goals without feeling hassled. Co workers were helpful and will always work and help me when help was needed. Hardest part of job was when the store was busy and i would have to drop what i was doing in my department to help cashier in the front end, which would set me back on my daily department goals. Most enjoyable part was working with a friendly and help staff while feeling appreciated by management for working hard."
good,"Normal busy days, nice co workers.  I have learned that helping makes myself feel better.  Also learning new things is fun and doing the impossible is possible.  I love helping people and not having to worry that a customer has come and gone out of the store unhappy."
good,"Sprouts is that hidden grocery store if you don't shop there you'd think its like Whole Foods (expensive).  What you really get is a great lil store full of healthy fun options for any lifestyle and great environment and people to work with!"
good,you will really learn a lot co workers are helpfull i had a very nice experience just so sad i had to quit reason health how i wish if i get well can reapply thanks sprouts
good,Oversees schedules for cashiers and scan. Provide friendly and prompt service to customer. Balanced  cash draw and safe at the end of the night. Orders and maintains inventory. Maintains budgeted percentages related to sales labor and margins.
good,"I loved working for sprouts, they provide flexibility for students and there is always opportunity for advancement."
good,"I really enjoy working at sprouts. I was able to learn new things, meet new people and grow within the company. The products sold there are amazing and i'm happy I had the opportunity to work there."
good,"Great people and great environment, just be ready to work. Customers are demanding and your feet will hurt after each shift, but its worth it. Great team"
good,"This job is good for students who just want to make some money on the side. This job is super relaxed, as a courtesy clerk my job duties include bagging groceries, taking go back items, grabbing carts and doing store sweeps. I really liked the job but sadly left because of the hours shortage, if that weren't to happen I would have stayed. Overall, management and coworkers were very friendly and we all worked as team players."
good,Work was a good environment great team members. Work was fast paced and allowed the day to progess in a similar fashion. Would work at this company again.
good,"It's an good place to work, the employees there is real nice and funny which makes being at work fun. The problem with working here is that the hours is not dependable. Every week your hours decrease or increases and that's not dependable. If your looking for a part time  job this will be a great place for you hour wise."
good,"A ideal day would include breaking down loads stocking sales floor , ordering inventory hiring firing and making sure the deli is in safe working order and following all health codes as well as assuring all company's rules and regulations are being followed on a daily basis, The most important of all is customer focus making sure every and all employees coming threw are treated with the up most respect in a timely manor and walk away completely satisfied in every way possible"
good,It was a good job when they first opened but now you are lucky if you get one day to work. the coworkers are good people to work with but the management needs more skills and learn how to make a schedule thats fair for all employees
good,It was as a temporary job. It wasn’t enough money or hours. They would always cut hours and send people home early. It’s like how are we suppose to survive if we can’t reply on consistent hours
good,"Sprout deli offers an incredible variety of cook and prepared food. It is our belief that everyone deserves delicious and healthy food at a reasonable price, you get that at Sprouts!"
good,Very friendly place to work. Perfect for college students. Good place to work to learn something new. No job I've ever had has taught me so much. Great place to make better life decisions.
good,"I have enjoyed my fellow team members. I feel that my manager has been fair, but she does have a job to do, and sometimes her decisions have not been well received by some team members."
good,Good place for first time job seekers and for starving students. You can actually get 15 percent off on groceries and that can go a long way in the long run.
good,Sprouts was a perfect place to get my foot in the door. I feel much more comfortable with the atmosphere of a work environment now and considering my duties I feel I have a basis of job.
good,"Sprouts was my favorite job!  I loved the people, my boss, everything. What ruined my experience was the change in management, it was awful and the only thing that made me leave."
good,a great place to work at can be very busy at points pay is very fair and a great enviroment to work at.  The managers are a little not all bur some

good,"The retail store is growing for all of the right reasons."
good,"work 10 hours a day, typical retail management job, hardest part is to give all the outside supervision what they want because they all have different visions so you have to change everything everyday, small enough where you can get to know each team member as family."
good,"love the position, but I need more hours this is a little extra for a voluntary statement of my job and store. I enjoy customer service that is fast and accurate, with polite and courteous communication, so that's how I treat every customer."
good,"Great management, flexible hours, I would highly recommend to any new employee. Staff members were upbeat, positive, and helpful in difficult situations."

good,"Working at this job was enjoyable"
good,First few months working at sprouts I was greeted and treated with a lot of respect from my fellow co-workers I enjoyed my job a lot and most of the people I worked with.
good,"I had taken classes in vitamin supplements, as well as kept that tradition in the house of my family. I was only a beginner when it came to this job, but i enjoyed learning knew suppplements and the value of the benefit of them."
good,"There was never a bad day working for sprouts unless I was sick- I didn't want to get the customer's sick so I felt bad! To me, that was a bad day. Any other day, I had the pleasure of checking out such joyful and full of life customers!! Just being to help them with their daily grocery needs. There wasn't really a hard part in my job role. The fact that I was able to make people laugh and put a smile on their face was great enough!"
good,I learned to improve my time management skills working in this fast-paced environment. As well as learning about product knowledge to better assist customers.
good,Overall this place was amazing to work at. They keep you very informed about their products and whats on sale. They are very goof with schedules and late arrivals.
good,i enjoyed the work environment at this company. everyone i worked with is friendly and more than willing to help you as soon as you walk into the door.
good,"I mostly used customer service, and communication skills to talk to both customers and fellow employees. If a customer was displeased, it was my responsibility to make sure that the mistake was corrected."
good,everyone here are so nice and motivational. the benefits are great and hours are very flexible. I've been working with this company for quite a while and  haven't had any concerns.
good,"Probably the best job i had. Managers are great, coworkers are friendly and no one descriminates. Began as courtesy clerk tgen quickly moved to cashier and then stayed in the vitamin department."
good,what I learn at sprouts was more customer service and working with other at a team and mangers weren't their best  some days were trying stressful when we were short on people
good,"It was an enjoyable work experience. I had a seasonal job, working as a cashier at the Sprout's located in Saratoga. I was able to take away a number of skills from the job, especially customer service and personable interactions."
good,"Working at Sprouts keeps me busy and I don't have to worry about not having anything to do. My department feels a little understaffed and I spend a lot of time working on my own, I would prefer being able to share the work with someone else, but I am able to get everything accomplished. I would say that is the worse part of the job, but even then it isn't much to complain about."
good,"This job was amazing I have learned a lot from Sprouts, The most enjoyable part of the job was actually working honestly. The work environment was always fun and friendly."
good,"I enjoyed working at Sprouts. The management was fair to us all, with an open door policy. We were encouraged to have fun and enjoy our work experience for the day. I had many friends at my store and I enjoyed each and every work experience with them. I was encouraged to move forward within the company and it was nice that I was appreciated and respected. I had a great experience working for Sprouts and it has become a favorite workplace thus far."
good,"Its not a great job, pretty much just get told what to do then i would do the task to the best of my ability. I learned how to take inventory."
good,"Nice place to work, enjoyed serving customers.  Co-workers were pleasant to work with, clean environment.  Management showed appreciated patience."
good,"I worked here as a seasonal and the management was awesome."
good,"There was not one mean person that worked at sprouts ,we all greeted each other and were like a big family. Managers were great and cheerful and understanding .They knew we all worked hard and worked hard with us.the hours got less and less.Not managements fault."
good,"Clocking in to work everyone would have a smile on their face and be ready to work. I learned their ""YES"" program, It's when a customer gets whatever they want to keep them happy for ex. a customer tells you they bought a head of lettuce here and it's brown now and they want a new one, You have to tell them yes in order to keep them happy, even if they are rude about it. The management was great I loved them, they were always happy and nice to everyone but also got everything done. My co-workers were great as well, I made a lot of friends at that store. The hardest part of the job was the heat while I was rounding up the carts in the parking lot and bringing them inside the store. It was Nevada, what do you expect I still loved to do it! The most enjoyable part of the job was that everyone their was like a big family, we all opened the store together it was great."
good,I really enjoyed working at Sprouts Farmers Market. It was challenging at times but very rewarding. Customers were great and I enjoyed being part of the team.
good,There are a lot of opportunities to grow and advance at this fast pace company. I have really enjoyed the short time i have worked there.
good,"enjoyed working here!!!!!!!!!   the team of employees were like family, all working together to make it a great place for our customers & our families."
good,"I over see all operations of the store.I would do papare work, order product , recieve , fill ad items, customer service, work in all dept. stock and build displays.I manage 25 to 30 emplyees a day. I train employees on customer service.I learn each day the financial part of busniess.I enjoy helping and training employees and help the customers with whatever it is they need. I love making them happy when they leave the store."
good,"great company! management is key for favoritism, great perks to the job. wonderful employees to work with, great benefits and job perks."
good,learned much about people. Learned much about teamwork and value thereof. great staff who are team players. hardest part; the heat of summer.Most enjoyable; the customers.
good,Nice place to work at because people are very helpful and friendly as well
good,Not terrible i guess it could always be worse. Its fun at times. Too much boo hoo and backstabing otherwise its a chill job not for the faint of heart
good,"The staff went out of their way to help each other and customers. Our customers were often highly devoted to the store."
good,"Working at sprouts was definitely a great and different experience,everyone was always extremely friendly and close. I also learned a lot by being able to move around in different departments."
good,"The people you work with are fun and driven. Company is stickers for detail, so make sure you learn right protocols and work hard and you'll be succesful."
good,"Enjoyed working at Sprouts, however poor management and leadership.  Would go to them and advise some of the issues that I was having with other mangers and co-workers.  At review time they would then use that against you as issues that you need to work on. Lots of work which I enjoyed however very little had to do with actual project management.  Were expected to be the PM, BA and resource manager, but would not give enough time in the day to get completed.  Co-workers and benefits were excellent."
good,if you would like a job that your breaks are even rushed this is for you. some departments are better then others. decently paying with good benefits. very productive always something to do. employees are extremely friendly and outgoing. my bakery manager was a absolutely awesome person. i miss my coworkers but i moved.
good,"Best feature: There is a great teamwork mentality at Sprouts. Everyone is willing to pitch in."
good,I enjoyed working there. Great people and great products. Most of the time there was always something to do that kept me busy. The people there can be fun and are very relaxed for the most part.
good,I still would be there if it wasn't for poor management or shortages on reliable employees who cared about their jobs or their coworkers and wasn't willing to do anything when complaints were made about uncomfortable situations made.
good,"Friendly and positive vibes "
good,"Spouts has a good working environment. Management can be a little tough, as they are unprofessional at times. Other than that: fair pay, availability fairly open. Doesn't really allow time for leave. Which makes balancing work and personal life difficult. Meaning there should be a certain amount of days/weeks paid holiday a worker can take."
good,I was there for a year and a half and realized to move up you have to be someone's favorite. Coworkers were great and the environment is good place to work
good,"I loved working here. The only reason why I left this job was because I had a child and decided to become a stay at home mom. Sprouts did offer me my 12 weeks of maternity leave, which I thought was incredible. The only reason I did not go back was because I wanted to return to school to have a career."
good,"loved working there nice people if you work hard, willing to work with special days off if needeed. other then that i am filling spacde cause i have to have 150"
good,"•	Retrieved carts from designated areas "
good,"Fun fast paced"
good,Cashier/ring up customers for their shopping needs. Help stock aisles. I learned how to deal with Not-So-Happy customers. Management is great. My co-workers awesome and very fun group to work with. hardest part of my job is working late hours. Most enjoyable part of my job is having fun at work and %15 employee discount
good,"worked at the meat department fun place to work. co workers are helpful ,"
good,"It was sometimes a difficult job at Sprouts, especially when I worked in the bakery department by myself, but the area had a very positive feel to it."
good,"Good culture natural organic produce and products . co-workers are friendly."
good,"Empowers employees to make on-the-spot decisions with regards to customer service, including returns. It keeps customers happier when you can just say ""Yes, we can accept your return."" without having to call the manager over to assess the situation and make them wait. My location also seemed a bit lax on rules, so long as you were doing your job correctly. Management seemed to really care about the employees on a personal level, (even if their hands were somewhat tied with regards to hours and pay) and were willing to hear you out and help if someone needed extra support. This all lead to happier employees who had passion for their work. I loved my job, even though cashier work is fairly mundane and menial, and the pay/hours were not great. This is a great first job for young folks, but not for people seeking immediate financial stability. "
good,"Team is very driven and motivated to execute company mission, however some of the management staff were very manipulative and deceptive—however, I believe they are no longer in position with company at this time."
good,"Can have some slower moments, but is mostly pretty fast paced and makes the day go by fast. Wonderful coworkers and managers. Pretty good benefits when you've been with the company for a certain amount of time. Amazing sales, employee discounts that can be stacked when making a purchase. Amazing product that you can't find at any other grocery stores."
good,I loved my clientel that I established  through shopping experiences. I knew them all by first name and I knew their order or their likes and dislikes.
good,"NEVER HAD AN ISSUE WITH Sprouts Farmers Market, perfect for those who want to grow and start a career in the grocery business. Good benefits, flexible ours."
good,"Ringing up customers groceries, greets customers , the pay is good depending on how long you been in retail , cut hours a lot . Best sprouts is a great company to work for ."
good,"a great company that is growing quickly, and is ready to have the people to run it. great pay, benefits, and company culture. a day was fast paced and a bit hectic at times, but your always bust helping a customer with orders, items or general knowledge of products.stocking and general cleaning."
good,Was a fun place to work. At time sit was a quick pace and other times you helped straightened up your isle for your work line. Helped customers find things they would like to purchase. Keep your area clean and presentable for customers. Always smile and make customers feel welcomed.
good,"Work can be repetitive but is easily mastered, can be physically demanding at times. Workplace is relaxed and a fun place to work. I enjoy assisting the customers with their shopping needs."
good,The Deli Department is very fast paced. The most difficult part is tending to customers while still finishing your particular job that day. The most enjoyable part is getting paid weekly and socializing when able to while working.
good,Good place to work not a lot of stress . Of course that depends on your supervisor . Do your job get along with coworkers and its a good place to work .
good,"The hours are not family friendly , the pay is not good. I make half as much then when I worked at Albertsons. The company and the team members are great. The problem is they don't pay very well."
good,"Great culture, management is up in air some days good some days not so good. Overall great company w/ family values. Would like to see better compensation and benefits after 90 days."
good,Great place to work for students. Management works around your school schedule. The culture of the company is welcoming and productive. Employees are really friendly and allow you to help them in other departments.
good,"During the year that I worked at Sporuts I quite enjoyed myself. The people were nice and friendly, as well as the customers. But after a year, we got new managers that hardly anyone liked. I felt like I was always being watched, and they would get upset at me for not finishing a job that requires more than 2 people. Not very many people liked the head manager, so we quit. It was no longer a place a enjoyed working at."
good,"Sprouts is a friendly place to shop with great customer service to its customers. I've learned a lot at sprout in the past 2 hears that I've  been working there. For example, building sets, browsing before you do the set and symmetry. My co- workers are fun and loving people ver compassionate in what they do. Management is good but needs a little improvement on some areas. The most enjoyable thing at my job is giving out the best customer service that I can provide to our customers and making tier time enjoyable while shopping at sprouts."
good,"This is a good place to work for. I enjoy working here, and have learned a lot about healthy eating. There is more out there I believe than working in a grocery store though."
good,basically everyone was very friendly in the company that I worked with on a daily basis.. the hardest part of the job was my schedule only reason I had to resign was due to the fact that my husband became a grocery manager for the same company but at a different store and my manager wouldnt follow his schedule so that I could still work.. so I had to resign as a employee through Sprouts to be at home with my kids because we didnt have a babysitter.
good,foods good take care of there employees and some  bosses are kool not all bad to work there
good,"Overall it was a great part time position while attending university, very flexible and decent amount of hours. Provides benefits and an in store discount to the employees and their families."
good,I love shopping at sprouts farmers markets. I love the people at sprouts farmers market and I love the managers at sprouts farmers market. They greet people with a smile and help them at the cash registers when ever necessary. Plus they are a newer franchise. They provide business with locals and provide locals with opportunities to save money.
good,As a courtesy clerk my job is to make sure the store is always clean and presentable. I am part of the front end department so I help the cashiers when needed. It’s a fast paced job and you have to be quick on your feet because you are wanted everywhere.  You must complete all your responsibilities before leaving and the next courtesy clerk coming in will pick up where you left off.
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Sprouts. Management works hard. There is never a dull day. New day, a new challenge. I would recommend this company to anyone looking for employment."
good,"Everyone was friendly and I really liked working there. Unfortunately, they did not have enough hours for my needs at the time.  I would have stayed with the company for the long haul but I needed to make more money."
good,Working hours are early in the morning. Baking items for the day. Get off early with having the rest of the day to enjoy. Laid back work place. I enjoy working here.
good,Really early time starts and lots of work. Store manager was very terrible his assistants were better to work with. Build many regulars and days are fun filled with other employees
good,"They don't ever fire anybody. Which is great, except for the fact I had to do all of my co-workers work because they slacked off so much. Informed management and they did nothing about it."
good,I met a lot of good people and always had fun working there. I moved back to Kansas and they were very nice about me quitting. There is a sprout in Wichita now and I always shop there
good,"I learned different software, used daily for my position."
good,"A typical day at work usually consisted of packaging all the breads and pastries from the previous baker who goes home after you come in. Work entirely by yourself stocking shelves, then prepare breads and pastries for the baker the next morning. I learned a lot about the different breads and pastries. My bakery manager was down to earth and would always help you out with getting days off for family functions. The hardest part of the job is getting used to the freezer. The most enjoyable part of the job was the job itself."
good,"I have worked in retail most of my life, and working with other employees and customers are highlights of my day at Sprouts, and other retail jobs that I have had. The culture of my job at Sprouts has been positive, and we work with all different kinds of personalities which I like. I would say that the hardest part of working at Sprouts is making sure that the customers are completely satisfied when they leave our store, but this is an area that I thrive in...Pleasing people is what I like to do best, I think this answers both the hardest part and the most enjoyable part all in one sentence."
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company.  The managers were great, the people I worked with were very helpful and nice. I learned that great customer service goes a long way. Helping others is what I got out of working at sprouts farmers market."
good,Its very calm. Laid back they understand any situation u may have and trys to work with you. Lunch is decent healthy eating gets you a peace of mind you can sit outside and eat go to your car listen to music have ur phone long as you clean up and when uts closing time we all leave together
good,"Typical hours were not consistent, as a general rule.  Good management teams, and some advancement opportunities, but unfortunately they do not seek those employees that are looking for advancement in the company."
good,"I loved working at Sprouts Farmers Market. Although working weekends was fast-paced and busy, most customers and employees were friendly. Sprouts offered weekly information and training on produce and a variety of products we were able to sample. Most of my managers were incredible. My only complaint was the particular store I worked at had an inconsistent and changing management team. I ultimately left to focus on finishing my degree, but I had a great experience with Sprouts and still enjoy shopping there."
good,"Sprouts is a great place to work if you are at the end of your career or at the beginning of your career. Many people started young and have worked up into management. The culture is up beat and friendly. The job duties are consistent. The customers are friendly.  You are able to have some fun. It isn't easy work, but it is fun."
good,good people and busy environment to work. there is always something to do from a lot of costumer service to different kinds of task and again a lot of costumer service.
good,Best part of the work is that I Love doing customer service love the concept of the company. I have learned more about the healthy parts of foods and vitamans
good,"I enjoyed my time at Sprouts."
good,"It was a productive work place, There is lots of team work and customers service is great. Start with a team meeting every morning"
good,A typical day of work is very task oriented. Always have to keep yourself busy. Management is very professional and friendly. Generally minimal to moderate supervision. Coworkers are very sociable. Most difficult part of the job would be the difficult customers and the amount of them on the discount days. Most enjoyable would be the customers that are courteous to the workers.
good,"It's a great place to work, very physical.  A lot of team work, huddles a least three time a day.  I love customer service.  Management is very reasonable"
good,"Sprouts is an excellent place to work! it is a minimum wage job so the pay can be better."
good,"Enjoyed working at Sprouts and with the other staff,Friendly, Respectful,very Productive Environment.I learned a lot from different departments. I can be Utalized in many Departments."
good,"Fast paced and friendly work environment. I've learned that working at sprouts who would have known that it'll feel like as if you were working at home, Your workers become great friends and management is tough but very fair and understanding!"
good,Processed payroll and provided customer service to support team members at stores. Great company and I enjoyed working there.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people who absolutely love what they do and push you to be better. The Creative department was well managed and full of amazing artists.
good,"Flexible schedules, understanding management, and informed co-workers. Only downsides are the pay scale and that the schedule is inconsistent."
good,I Gained in Store Functions and loved the need for urgency and need to be on your toes all day. never knew what customers were shopping for so everyday was a challenge to keep our department in great shape
good,"Good company for advancing, and learning departments. I've learned numerous skills, such as faxing and scanning invoices, thoroughly scanning items for invoices. Properly engaging in customer complaints and customer request. Organizing work wareroom, and sales floor. The most enjoyable part of my job are the interactive employees."
good,"Overall my job at Sprouts was awesome. My typical work day consisted of talking to customers all day, checking them out and cleaning the front end. I learned about customer interaction and how important it is to make everyone happy. The management at Sprouts depends on who you are working with. Some managers here what you have to say while others don't listen. It can make it hard to move up in the store. On the other hand all of my co-workers were incredibly friendly and cared about their job. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the managers, while the best part was the regular customers. While working there you build relationships and connections with people."
good,"Sprouts has been a fantastic employer, they have a fantastic onboarding process that I felt fully prepared me for my responsibilities as a cashier. My managers make me feel appreciated on a daily basis and the culture within the company is very healthy and positive."
good,Fun place to work. Able to see and learn new products. Dealing with new and interesting people. Having fun being a productive team member. I became versatile doing a variety of different tasks.
good,"The environment is great, but I am severely lacking in hours. All the employees are very friendly and up beat  it is an open floor concept that is easy to navigate"
good,I had a blast working at sprouts. We were like a giant family. Most of us opened the store from the start and followed sprouts core values that includes the word fun.
good,"Great experience,good Benifits for all employees an great family environment friendly staff team work everyone work an help with learning new task an help with task."
good,Great place to work! Very flexible only bummer is only management and head cashiers get full time. If you dont need full time hours and you want a good work home life balance this would be a good job for you
good,The team members and store managers express job satisfaction and hold Sprouts as an excellent place to work and grow. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning your well being through the healthy lifestyle initiative.
good,Absolutely loved working here! It was always very busy but the customers were always wonderful and in good moods. Staff is very welcoming and makes you feel like you're one of the family from the first day.
good,"An average day consisted of stocking shelves and interacting with "
good,"I was a cashier for 1 1/2 years.  They hired me before the new store opened.  I think we had a great staff.  I made 10.34 an hour.  Fortunately it was an extra income not my o ly household income."
good,Personal I loved sprouts worked In 2 different locations in Southern California and i loved it. We’re sprouts family management treats like your a person not a machine
good,The job was a normal cashier job but it was the people and the environment that made it fun. They really value their employees and care about what they think.
good,"I loved it, good hourly wage but was only scheduled 13 hours a week. I had to let it go. Perfect for a student or somebody that is already working full time."
good,Productive and a fun work place fast paced.easy to learn resources available at all times favorite place I've worked at yet. I would def recommend it to anyone.
good,Sprouts is a great place to work with a friendly staff and happy customers as well. While the environment can be hectic at times I feel like the pros far outweigh the cons and would recomend this job to anyone.
good,"The team at Sprouts are so friendly and super professional. You will be told ""Yes.' 9/10 times because they believe in pleasing the customers and giving the best product"
good,"The idea of Sprouts is awesome.Turn over is kinda high. I loved working there, and if Sprouts was in the upper Midwest, I'd still be working there.I loved educating my friends and family about the hot button issues of GMO's and organic groceries as well as personal learning about the vitamins and minerals."
good,"I loved working at Sprouts, the employees were very friendly and helped a lot. The culture of the place was very authentic. Sprouts was one of the best jobs I've had,"
good,I would definitely recommend this job to anyone! It is a great place full of great people. If you are willing to work hard and get to know your customers you will do just fine!
good,"i LOVE working at sprouts, i started out as a bagger and worked my way up to AC. if your a hard worker, you can definitely move up quickly. the enviorment is amazing i really could not ask for more, i am just looking for something alot more stable."
good,"Last month this would have been a bit different.  We had a terrible manager and everyone was miserable. Now that she's gone, the whole store feels happier!  No, you won't make enough to pay rent. Hours are constantly cut and new people are hired. It's a bit of a mess in that aspect.  Otherwise it's a great place to be. Coworkers are incredible, they are flexible, and it's just fun."
good,Sprouts is a very good company to work for there is always room for growth. The best part is there is always soemthjng to do and help customers with there needs. Customers leaving satisfied makes me satisfied.
good,"A lot of the employees that have been with this company have a lot of complaints. I guess because I have been around a little bit, I have seen a lot worst."
good,"As a vitamin manager, I come in at opening time and fill out sales/shrink reports. The store manager comes through the department and counts outs, then hands the outs list to me. I review the list and make sure the outs are on order, or I make sure they are on my next order. I review movement reports and adjust orders accordingly. I plan for and build displays for promotions almost every week. I make sure the department overstock is organized and stays that way to ensure accurate orders. I manage vitamin clerks and assistant by making to-do lists of monthly and daily tasks and encourage them to take their training modules. On top of management duties I am to stay on the sales floor and provide customer service. I must know where each item is located, and I answer specific questions and supplements and body care items. One must be very knowledgable or willing to learn in the Vitamin Department, as customers have many questions. This is a very demanding job that requires a lot of planning and critical thinking. There are too many duties to list. I am fortunate to have a good store manager that provides what they can to my department, but I had to show them that I truly want to succeed. All in all, I'd say the position can be stressful at times, but I know every day I am helping a person in their healthly lifestyle journey, and that is a reward in itself."
good,"its a good job, honestly if i got more hours i would have never quit the job, i enjoyed working there every much. just gotta have good discipline if you are trying to keep your figure. easy to gain weight while working there."
good,"Sprouts is a neat company to work for. There is a high level of diversity in each store, from clerks all the way up to the management. The company has strong policies regarding Mutual Respect, which are covered during orientation and training, and these policies provide a firm basis for an environment in which people feel socially and emotionally safe."
good,I had an enjoyable and ultimately fruitful time working at Sprouts and I found myself having to become flexible on the spot with my schedule in order to cover for my coworkers.
good,"I enjoyed working with my coworkers. yes it could be stressful at times but what job isn't. I enjoyed getting to know alot of my customers. I learned alot about different cheeses that I had never heard of. The Store Manager was always easy to talk to , and he really cared about his employees and had an open door policy"
good,"I was a cashier at Sprouts.  Showed up on time all the time and stayed to end of my shift or when they needed me to leave."
good,great job learned a lot about inventory work and baking as well. management was helpful everyday. did not have to deal with customers as much. the hardest part for me was pulling from the freezer every morning for stocking. I loved the day time shifts.
good,Oh Just love this establishment and everything about it I love this place what it represents the healthiness the prices the freshness and overall samples.
good,"Awesome job. Great environment, co workers all work together and get along. Management is understanding and very helpful. They pay more than a typical store."
good,"This place was fun to work at. Management was great except one manager but he ended up getting transferred to another location. Customers were friendly, made amazing friends here. Always let you know if you were doing a great job and if not they would help you improve on your work. They provide health care, and even have a scholarship program and employees qualify after two years."
good,Customer service experience opportunity as well as opportunity to work in a culturally diverse environment. Practiced organizational skills and multi-tasking between assisting customers and maintaining a clean facility.
good,"great company to work for, easy job, I would come in and go staright to the register made sure my cash was ready to go for the day , organized my area before it would get busy"
good,nice place to work. alot of hard work but rewarding. customer interaction great. management there when needed. employees worked together. typical day baking stocking and customer service.
good,"The hardest part of the job is the busy hours during lunch time when everyone wants to order a sandwich. Unless you are a closer, then you have to balance all of that and trying to get your team to work with you on keeping the area tidy so you can have an easier time closing the department at night. However there is a lot of freedom, and the job is very fun, it's just very busy, but that is expected at all jobs so that is not a problem whatsoever. Management is pretty cool, it's just an issue of helping the new workers adapt so everything can run smoothly, which takes time. There are lots of promotions to boost team member morale, like team member appreciations days where the discounts are increased and you get a feast in the break room. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Sprouts, and you meet so many awesome people."
good,"My position was focused on customer service and cash handling.  This job taught me how to resolve different customer needs while staying focused on the detail of the cash transactions.  I learned food safety, healthy food options and how to handle difficult customers.  I enjoyed the flexible hours, most of the customers, the team atmosphere and my co-workers."
good,"Really great place to work, overall fun place to work in such a fast growing company. The culture is one of the strongest in the industry. Management is great as well as co-workers. Most enjoyable is the the reasonable size of the store, which everything is excess-able like a old style farmers market back in such a more simpler time.."
good,"Very fun place to work, Always something to do. "
good,"Great company to work for in a little atmosphere"
good,"I do enjoy working at the Sprout's deli, but it is not easy work, at all. You never stop moving and there is always TONS to do. My coworkers are amazing, despite the occasional drama. My only problem is that for the amount of work I am doing, I don't think I am being paid decent enough."
good,I love working for this company. They respect their customers and are very customer service oriented but they also treat their employees well. The management are more then willing to work with your schedule. I have not met a fellow employee who was not respectful. This is one of the best companies I have worked for. The only downside right now is I do not get enough hours.
good,You are greeted with fellow employees saying hello and a warning welcome. You clock into the back and in the break room there is always food for you. As a cashier I do a produce walk and make sure everything looks good in produce. I sign into my register and greet customers and scan items and bag groceries. Very fun job!
good,I really liked working for Sprouts. They do a lot of good things and I personally would recommend working there. The only thing is the pay wasn't that great compared to the job I got right after.
good,"I needed a job to begin to add to my resume and sprouts accomplished that for me. Nice work environment, paid weekly, hours usually were not that great, but for a college student they were excellent."
good,Great place to work most of the time. Great pay depends on department  and experience. Great discounts for employees..  Healthcare benefits not so good needs work.
good,"My typical day at work, consisted of helping people pay for their groceries. I learned how to ring people out as a cashier. Management would always help out when needed. The hardest part of the job was keeping a cool head when accidentally upsetting customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the old folk who liked to eat healthy."
good,I really enjoyed my time at sprouts. I loved the challenges I over came as well as the customer interaction. I learned everything i know now from the meat department. I'm great-full to my previous meat manager for giving me the opportunity.
good,"This had been my favorite place of employment. Overall the work isn’t enthralling, but it can be fulfilling and rewarding if you give it enough. You just stock shelves, organize them, backstock, help out in other departments."
good,This is one of the best jobs ever had fast pace friendly and a high level of integrity great benefits and competitive pay. The only reason I left is to get more experience so I could come back as part of the store management team
good,"The customers and employees are generally a kind bunch. It was a nice growing experience as my first retail job. I was regularly getting 25-30 hours per week for the first 3 months, but the seasonal decline in customer traffic took hours down to 10-20 per week."
good,Sprouts was a great job to have! They were very nice and all hard working. Flexible work hours with my busy schedule.I would recommend working there to everyone. Great work experience and good pay as well
good,"Overall the best place to work in the industry for many reasons. Excellent leadership at and above store level. Team inclusion environment, high standards, and operations expectations."
good,"There is very little to say about this company which is bad. I have been in grocery for upwards of a decade, and I have yet to see a better model than what I had seen at Sprouts."
good,Hard to get hours here mangers dont seem to care for the employees just about there bonus and when the bosses come in that everything looks nice so they just start yelling at everyone.
good,"Sprouts is a great place to work at. Family oriented, great balance between work and school. Easy work day. Management are great. Environment and location is good."
good,Working for Sprouts is a fun place to work I enjoy the people and my co workers. I learned how to drink and eat healthy changing my eating habbits. I went 2 months vegan. It was different but i felt more energy when I was on duty. It was a great experience.
good,I was hired on the spot. within 2 months of working with the company I was promoted because of my job performance and my ability to multi task. I learned to interact with the customers and its always  good to get to know your customers and let them know your always there to help.
good,"I believe Sprouts is a great work environment, but being with the company for  over four years, I am  the type of person who likes to advance and grow with the company, I am  a supervisor but I crave more advancement, and right now the company does not have there to offer me at the moment."
good,"I love working at sprouts. The costumers are always so nice to me, and my coworkers were always easy to get along with. Management was usually helpful and insightful."
good,"Company is moving in a healthy direction, very good at teaching accountability. Work days consisted of lots of customer interaction. Getting the exposure to all departments within the store helped build knowledge that I use every day. Hardest part was dealing with turnover when the jobs made others leave unexpectedly. "
good,Sprouts has an awesome environment the people are great that you work with the company culture is very nice.  The management is very approachable it just is not my dream job.  It was a part time job while I finished nursing school they are very flexible with students.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I get to work with and the customers are great.
good,"Being a full time college student, they are very flexible with my schedule. It is a great part-time job and it is not very stressful. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a simple job."
good,"Great Place to Work, good work life balance. Employee discounts at the stores."
good,Sprouts is a great place to work if you believe in a healthy lifestyle and love to talk to people and give great customer service. There is a number of jobs to apply for.
good,"Great culture with tons of advancement opportunity.  Management has high expectations on performance, high standards for store conditions as well as program execution.  Even with the pressure associated with maintaining high standards and conditions, Sprouts has a fun workplace environment."
good,It would be better if they had a better manager in the Deli he does not  how too treat or talk to his employees. He goes around talking bout everyone in the deli he isn't professional at all.
good,The nature of a grocery store is repetitive work. Sprouts was still a great company. Comments were taken seriously even if they took some time to implement. Management at all levels was open to communication.
good,"Good work environment, friendly people. Depending on who management is in your store, it can range from Perfect to terrible store management. Benefits are great, don't kick in until 13 months though. employee discount is terrible, only covers tax. I would recommend this job for a beginning job or temporary. my father has worked for them for over 10 years and he wants to leave everyday because yes same work everyday can and will get old."
good,"This is where I learned a lot of my skills I know today for housing. I loved what I got out of it meaning all the labor I was doing, I learned a lot aboutconstruction through this company"
good,"Sprouts pays well and is not overly demanding, but hours can get unreliable, especially around the holidays. Management changed frequently, but all of the managers were friendly and built good relationships with their employees."
good,"My experience was good, the managers and your co-workers are very friendly and make adapting to the workplace easier than other companies. The environment created by the employees makes the job more pleasant"
good,"I was an employee at Sprouts Farmers Market for about two years and in my years I enjoyed working with my co workers . It was a very fun very easy job , except they would change managers all the time which made it hard for us workers to get along . And since majority of the employees at the store were college students they hated being flexible with our schedules, other than that its a very awesome place to work."
good,"Sprouts on Genesee Ave is very outgoing store. Customers love it i enjoy working there. Management is very professional, and have positive attitudes towards everyone including understanding of each ones needs. Co-workers are easy to work with, a very laid back store. I love being a cashier and interact with customers that is my favorite part. The hardest part, i would say is nothing really hard. I have been working customer service for a while now and nothing is really new to me, within this type of job environment. Typical day is fun very productive,i leave feeling great because i love being a cashier, working, and facing new challenges, you learn something new everyday there."
good,Excellent place to work. Very busy and productive. Everyone works very hard to maintain a great atmosphere and friendly service.
good,I have good customer service injoy inter acting with the customer's and I love talking to the customer's and helping them out when they need help if they ask were something is I would take them to the.products are instead of pointing  were something is at a good customer service is taking them to the product
good,It was a good work enviorment at all my jobs.I Iearned alotin the short time i was there. there were alot of good people there. i made some good progress with everyone i became friend with.
good,"they were like family to me, good place to work, good pay, I was fired but I still have good relationship with everyone in the store."
good,"Everyone is super friendly and helpful. Everyone works as a team and is more than willing to help anyone with any questions. "
good,"Sprouts is an amazing place to grow if you think team minded and see that you are there to help grow the business. With a willingness to be coachable, to work hard and produce fast, you can easily excel in the deli department. "
good,Sprouts is a fun place to work. The employees are friendly an customer focused. The company offers a quality product at very reasonable pricing. The work in the Deli is fast paced. The shift goes by quickly. The hardest part of the job is lifting heavy boxes of product like cheese. The most enjoyable are the staff and customers.
good,"Sprouts was truly a great job. They took me under their wing and trained me up in several departments. I enjoyed the work, and even more so my co-workers. Good management goes along way in the work place, and we had great people in charge."
good,"they had no hours to give anyone. it wasn't the managements fault. they had to do what they were told. other than that the place was amazing. it was never slow, and always fast pace work."
good,"Sprouts Farmers Market is a great company. They have great benefits, most managers are pleasant to work with, they make you more knowledgeable about your products,and most of the time customers are always complementing on how nice the store looks.most employees strive for perfectionism, which most managers absolutely love. Unfortunately this can become an issue because the managers will pick their workhorse, then work you promising a promotion or pay raise, just to keep you going."
good,Arrive ready to work. This was a high volume store that was rarely not busy. Running all aspects of customer service and ensuring that all product was quality inspected and visually appealing. Over several departments. Constant delegation and follow up.
good,"Working at Sprouts Farmer's Market is enjoyable. The atmosphere is positive and, for the most part, the workers are genuinely friendly. The management is understanding and will work with the employees to solve any issues. The hardest part of the job would have to be the public, because human behavior is complex and hard to predict. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the fellow employees as well as public."
good,Great co-workers and a nice store environment. World class customer service and a no hassle return policy. Farmers Market that specializes in fresh produce. Managers take time to show employees how to do things correctly.
good,"My typical day was clocking in and begin to collect carts from the parking lot, bag grocery's, assist customers find items or out to their vehicles, clean up spills, take out the trash and I have also painted when it was required. "
good,"Sprouts has a vast variety of jobs to look into. Oppertunities to work your way to a department head or a store director."
good,Typical day at work is pretty much always making customers happy and helping others as well as have fun doing it. I've learned a lot of things working here and have been open to many opportunities. Management has always been great. Co-workers are very easy to get along with and enjoyable to work with. There is no hard part in my job. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers and teaching them new things they've never learned of.
good,"Working with this company you had a typical store day. Greeting and assisting customers making sandwiches, answering phone calls if needed, stocking items, cashiering, things of that nature. The management was okay to work for but not great. I learned that it helps to work together to get a job done at least there because it was always busy "
good,"its a fun fast paste place to work "
good,I personally loved working at Sprouts. It is such a friendly environment that makes you want to come everyday. Managers were very hands on and never hesitated go get their hands dirty and were always willing to help.
good,"I liked working there, once you got the hang of the produce items it was as easy as pie. The customers were nice, especially the regulars and so was the staff."
good,It's really easy to move up into management and switch departments if you want to try something else. It's very comfortable and flexible. Paid weekly.
good,"sprouts was a very diverse grocery store, with plenty of opportunities to learn and gain experience.  there was also natural remedies for many things and it is a productive workplace."
good,"Great company. And I worked with the best manager. My co workers were awesome. We worked as a team and always helped each other. I learned so much when I worked there. I would work there still, but live in Tennesse  and there is not one close to me."
good,"I was only here for a short time of 1 year due to relocating out of the country.  I loved my job, the people I worked with and my store and assistant managers where wonderful."
good,My problem was my mother was 89 and had massive heartache which made my points high. I then received low housing in Fresno California and had to relocate. Wasn't able to transfer to Fresno stores manager wouldn't look over points. So was not rehired even though I continue to apply. I've been working as a cashier at restaurant depot but trying very hard to become a rehire.
good,"The first thing I do when going inside talks to my employees then go clock in, the next thing I do is start a store sweep because you have to have five done by the end of your shift then I do the carts which can be hard or easy depending on the person. When a customer asks for help you assist them the nices way you know-how. Sprouts Farmers Market is a wonderful environment and a great place to work."
good,There were fair at the time there with sprouts i loved working there but had a difficult time with paul pedrasa he wouldn't stop harassing me started on day one when he got transferred there we lost so many employees put i stayed tell i couldn't take it any more he cut my hrs slowly then gave me only 2 day i have a family of 6 could not afford it i lost my car becuse of him
good,"I was hired as a Cashier. My manager was firm but approachable for just about anything, be it personal or about work.  The scheduling manager was considerate of accommodating your shifts to fit your personal life or school schedule.  I appreciated the genuine and friendly camaraderie amongst my team members.  Both guests and team members shared a great concern for a Healthy lifestyle.  I enjoyed a nice rapport with the patrons sharing recipe ideas and listening about their family life as I rang them up. Over time, you learn your guests quirky or particular habits or needs, and when you accommodate them, it makes them happy and feel important. And then there are people who are just plain rude, or in a hurry and inpatient about waiting in line, but you SMILE, rush through their order as quickly as possible, apologize for inconveniencing them, and welcome them back with a SMILE.  Other than that, I really enjoyed my working experience at Sprouts."
good,i would work there again if the time ever came. promotion is easy as long as you are a motivated employee.Discounts are great and they recognize hard work. keep yourself motivated and on track and they will notice
good,"Your coworkers make everything better, this place is a great environment. Everyone is respectful and kind. Great for young people as a beginners job, you'll get trained the right way in customer service."
good,"Smaller grocery store, produce and vitamins driven.  Most stores are based around the same idea.  Pretty casual from a uniform and work standpoint.  There are lots of departments to get interested in and move on to."
good,"I loved my job, cool co-workers, flexible hours and sweet management. I loved being paid weekly and having a certain amount of hours per week. Loved the discount too"
good,Everyone was fun and I enjoyed working there. The environment was laid back and friendly. I had the chance to work in multiple departments and help where I was needed.
good,"I actually began working at Sprouts out of desperation to find a job. I didn't think it would end up being my favorite place to work. When the store is busy, the work is fast-paced, but the work culture and fellow employees made the work relatively stress-free and often enjoyable. The pay was fair (about a dollar above minimum wage) and I received a small raise after roughly 9 months working there. Management was reasonable and made sure we kept on task but also far friendlier with employees than I am used to. I became rather close with my coworkers while there but also feel that Sprouts turned me into a fast, effective cashier. Excellent job"
good,"As with most places a good manager and cooperative team make for a great experience, where as poor managers lead to resentful teams. The corporate office is very helpful and send trainer when needed."
good,"I am very happy with the current management team at #578.  They take the time to listen and truly appreciate hard work.  For the most part, we work as a team and show respect for each other's differences."
good,"great i enjoyed working there. Overseen baking staff to ensure the bakery's standards are enforced. Flew out to other states to set up and train new managers and employees."
good,"I could work almost every position in the store, and at the time it was necessary. But, sprouts is really booming right now, so you won't have to endure that! Everybody there has a job to do, but it doesn't mean you don't get to cut up for a couple a minutes every now and again. "
good,Sprouts is a great company that I've been at for a while. And I would recommend friends and family to work in such a nice environment. Its a awesome experience.
good,"I liked working at Sprouts Farmers Market. I was a cashier before becoming a lead cashier. I even applied for cashier manager, but the manager end up not leaving. This company is a good place to work for."
good,"employees genuinely seem to like their jobs, management is easily available to talk to. have quarterly in house career days to talk about advancement."
good,I loved working for the store off of 67th and Deer valley. the works shows strong work ethic and support to one another. I would love to return to work for that exact store.
good,"Working in the deli has it's challenges but overall the job was excellent. Outstanding department managers/store managers. Customers can be a pain sometimes, but otherwise it's an easy job."
good,"Sprouts Farmers Market is a great place for first time jobs or for careers. They care deeply about their employees, going above and beyond to help those who need flexibility. The benefit of getting discounted groceries is a plus."
good,"Sprouts was awesome grocery store to work at. I met some awesome people there. A typical day was pulling carts, facing store items, cleaned any messes, pretty much just kept the store clean as possible as well as the consumer!"
good,A typical day at work consist of focusing on completing  the objectives of that day. I learned how to communicate and accomplish goals. Management is to help me achieve my goals. Work place culture is comfortable it is second nature. I look forward to facing challenge's to overcome. The most enjoyable part of the job is to get paid.
good,"Love my coworkers here in Flagstaff. Everyone is friendly and wanting to help others get the job done when they need it. Sometimes management gets schedules wrong, but usually they are quick to fix it if you tell them what's wrong in a timely manner."
good,"Here I learned produce codes and have also strengthened my customer service skills. I still handle money, and maintain cleanliness to the front end. I also got promoted to Head cashier which gave me more experience with closing out registers and cash handling procedures."
good,"A great place to work if you're inclined towards customer service. Doesn't have the feel of a big corporation, but with the benefits of such a company. Plenty of room for advancement if you're diligent and willing to transfer locations."
good,"While I enjoy working at Sprouts because of the environment, coworkers, and management, I guess I just get bored too easily when it comes to waiting around for it to get busy (which is lacking this time of year)."
good,"Sprouts is very fun to work in. However, employees don't get paid well at the beginning of their career there. The atmosphere is comfortable."
good,I learned a lot from this company on how to manage your time while product is baking. first shift starts at 4am and was pretty nice to come in alone with out any help.
good,Everyday was something different.  The people and employees made the day better I enjoyed the people I worked with and the customers also.
good,"Fun place to work, never boring. Always busy, and made great friends."
good,"Enjoyed every minute.  Outgoing and motivating to produce the best customer experience every day.  Scheduling 20 plus staff, controlled front end associates as well as the money incoming and out going."
good,I go into work and get things set up to start the day off.  I look for and pull any expired product and get it ready for the donation bin.  I then stock as much product for the customers that I can.  I help and talk to customers while doing this.  I think that I am a people person and love to interact with the customers.  The managers there are very open minded and listen to what we as department heads have to say.  I like my co workers and we are like family to each other.  The hardest part of the job is not knowing what the customers want from day to day.  They seem to change their minds all the time.  What I like best is helping that one person and seeing the joy on their face when I have what they are looking for.
good,While working at Sprouts Farmers Market I learned a lot of new things and I also learned how to change the things I did before to be more time-efficient. I had great coworkers and managers that were always patient during training and who made me feel like I was really a part of the team.
good,"A typical day at work- you work your 8hrs with fun management and you go home! "
good,A day at work starts with taking all product off wet rack and rebutting vegetables and placing back on rack in a nice way. Dealing with customers wanting their vegetables a certain way I found ways to learn customers on a one-on-one basis. Management was never a problem for me they would tell us what to do and the work was easy to get done so I worked a lot on my own did not need very much direction. The hardest part of the job was making sure customers were happy and not having the product in stock they were requesting. The easiest thing about working there was the work a very routine job not much change.
good,"My tryical day at work included checking the dates on Bakery products, baking bakery good,filling tables and shelves with all bakery products, keeping the bakery clean and tidy, taking phone orders, and always greeting the customer with a smile.  "
good,Love this place took a pay cut but I'm where I'm supposed to be i meet people and talk with customers everyday My manager is the Best I plan to be here for awhile Thank You Sprouts For Having Me Again
good,"If I wouldn't have gotten sick w my mental health I would still be there. I loved what I did"
good,"I worked in multiple departments, which was one of the aspects I most appreciated about the company. They promote from within and really recognize your efforts. It’s also easy to transfer if you need to relocate for personal reasons."
good,Everyday that I went to work it was a better experience since I always wanted to do better and better and have a better liking department for customers through out my time in my store. There’s no better feeling than seeing a clean department and knowing it’s yours with the help of all the team that was trained.
good,They are very carrying and help work with schooling it is a very easy job and the people are great to work with definitely a great opportunity for a first time job or long term
good,"To be honey I can’t say that I have one."
good,Sprouts was a great company to work for. I think its one of my favorites. The continuous education on different products they sell was really enlightening.
good,"The stores are busy, customer service is very important.  It has a family feel to work there.  We, have to always put the customer first, even though you maybe doing something else you were suppose to do.  Knowing you help give the customer a good experience and help them to live a better and heathier life style was my gratification for working there."
good,Kept getting passed over for promotions I was more than qualified for... Other than that super friendly environment. People were super nice. Enjoyed the peers I worked with
good,"I started working at Sprouts Farmers Market in May of 2017. The management highly supportive. They took the time and energy to find the best job position for me. "
good,"Great first job or High school student, managers are decent at best. Great group of employees and they care for the employee as well as the customer.."
good,"wonderful place to work, the management is always nice and friendly they also care to make sure everything is going alright there is always room for promotion and raises."
good,"I loved that I could have my hair colored and not have to worry about my boss getting mad at me. Also loved the fact that if I wanted any piercings, that they were okay. I absolutely love their products that they have for sure. Delicious produce."
good,"- typical day included pushing carts, bagging groceries and taking out the trash"
good,Great job. Everyone was nice and worked as a team. You felt treated like a person not a workhorse. Fun competitions for gift cards sometimes too. Good place to work.
good,I have been working here for 2 years and of course I have made my mistakes but I have ALWAYS learned from them and my manager was completely understanding and made sure I understood what I did wrong and how I can do better. Requesting off is always so easy and they are VERY flexible with your personal schedule. We do give out certain amount of points for call outs and sick days but as long as you come into work and watch your points there is no reason why you can't last there. We are more of a relaxed environment and I enjoy that a lot. I feel more relaxed and happy to come into work and working there. I also love the people I meet every day and my coworkers are like family to me. I want to stay here for as long as I can and I hope people will feel the same way
good,Fun healthy work environment. Great managers and coworkers. Lots of opportunities for advancing in the company. Has a great culture and fun and happy clients.
good,production was everything keeping the floors stocks. I learned that team work makes the dream work. Everybody's full of energy always helping costumers in need.
good,I love working for Sprouts! Not only is there a 15% discount for employees but management is awesome and so are the people I work with. I genuinely enjoy my job.
good,"The store manager job was very routine based which is ideal for me. I learned about product attributes and healthy living for less. Management was always honest and transparent. We had a very positive work culture always supported by our regional directors and trainers. The most challenging part of the job was also the most exciting part which was the changes in systems and process.I enjoyed my journey because of the changes we made to provide more resources to our team members designed to assist with efficiencies and easier access to tools and information,"
good,"Great environment, friendly management, and overall a great experience. Unfortunately, one error and you can lose it all. This job was very uptight..."
good,"Sprouts has proven to be a great place in management.  There is still a struggle for team members hours so therefore, more pressure on management.  But all in all a great place to work."
good,"Really nice co-workers. You always has to smile, when your having a bad or good day. Sprouts has a lot polite customers and co-worker.  I had fun working there."
good,sprouts was by far my favorite job. I worked there almost 2 years and it was the best two years of my life. Sprouts did get strict and really drifted from the point of being a chill place to get good food.
good,Fun place to work. Appreciates employees. Lots of chances to move up. Good discount. Great management. Great atmosphere. Good benefits except healthcare is expensive.
good,Sprouts is a great company. I had a great time there i really feel they take care of the employees with pay and just showing that they care. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a job.
good,"This was my first job as a college student. I have been a cashier there for about 3 years, and it was great to gain experience with customer service. It was a great job with other great employees. The managers are all very nice and accommodating."
good,I LOVE SPROUTS!! I love everything about working here! I love that there's so many diet and health and fitness food to choose from as i am vegan so it is nice to have all those options available to me. It is overall just amazing!
good,I enjoyed being the baker and working mornings and days. Everyone is so friendly. The location was close to my house. Management was easy to talk to and very understanding.
good,I like working at Sprouts. At times upper management can be a pain but I guess that anywhere. The good thing about Sprouts is they are growing so you can move up fast if you know what your doing.
good,Fun place to work. Enjoyed working with the customers. The management team is too pressured. Employees are advanced to quickly without proper training
good,Stay busy which makes the time go by. Pay is cool and management is also. Learned a lot about veggies and fruits while learning how to organize and stack
good,"I took this job to be close to home and to gain back my sanity after working in the most demanding of my work expereinces. "
good,A sprouts I learned to assert myself as a part of a team to work toward solutions and overcome challenges. Together we created a fun and positive atmosphere for customers that invited them to let us be part of their daily routine. The relationships i created there are fond and lasting and I remember that time always.
good,"A typical work day varies, each day is fun and exciting. I go to work smiling every day and providing excellent customer service is what I do best.My co-workers are always willing to help me, if I run into any trouble."
good,On a typical i assume my role as a supervisor and knock out my mandatory responsibilities so i can have more time to help others and so we can take care of the bumps in the road along the way.We work as a team and enjoy each others company.We have inside jokes and we laugh all day.Ive learned that every manager and place of any type of business has a different way of running things but you can always find a way to enjoy the work place no matter the conditions.
good,"Working here, a smile is always required and istn hard to find. A fun workplace that offers many things to do in downtime and great ways to team-build. Management is sensitive to families and issues and also willing to work with busy schedules."
good,"typical day of work was running the day to day operations of the front end. both co-workers and management worked as a team. nothing really hard bout my job.. loved the customers we had and being able to help them, as well as coworkers was the most enjoyable"
good,This job helped me learn many customer service skills and cross-trained me so I could get the most out of the time I was there. They are flexible and understanding about scheduling and availability.
good,As you enter the store your greeted with hello and everyone knows your name as a manager. I've learned that their are many different types of food then what you would see in a conventional market. Being there and working with different kinds of food has enabled me to better understand different kinds of eating habits that people have such as vegans and vegetarians etc..
good,"I worked for Sprouts Farmers Market starting out as a cashier but later was promoted to the Vitamin Department."
good,"Sprouts is a retailer that specializes in fresh produce, meats and special dietary needs. Additionally sprouts has an abundant supplement section and a large bulk foods section. The pay is competitive and there is a lot of room to move vertically in the company. Training is a huge part of the sprouts corporate philosophy and employees generally learn a lot about special dietary needs, and fresh foods. It is a great place for foodies to work. Management is not easy but it is rewarding. The company is years behind other retailers in terms of automation but employees learn to be retailers in a very basic sense. I had a great time and would happily work there again!"
good,"A typical day at work for me starts off being greeted by plenty of fun and friendly faces, most of which have become some of my closest friends. The management is involved, supportive, and helpful to the whole team. The hardest part of the job can be keeping up with workload, depending on the day, but it's usually doable. The most enjoyable part is seeing the sales floor like good after working it, and enjoying the whole work day with great people."
good,"A truck of fresh produce arrives daily to be broken down and stocked.What goes out first? Whats intended for back stock? Where do we go big? When to hold back? The challenge to provide a clean and full sales floor is still exciting and satisfying. I get to work with dedicated employees to both, provide customers with what they intended to come in for, and making sure the opportunity for up sale items are always available. This is not an easy task but can be very enjoyable when the strengths of all crew members are are pulled together. Even though ordering, writing schedules, and making tough decisions can be challenging in this very competitive industry. I feel as that all the extra planning and hard work are completely worth it. After all, we do provide the most essential part of a healthy diet, fruits and vegetables."
good,"Got right to work, Checked in with co-workers to have a daily plan, Always putting customers first, Meeting there needs ensured they would come back, Shipment was the hardest in weight only, Keeping the staffs moral up made my day! And there's. "
good,This is a great company to work for. I have a great deal of autonomy as long as I work within the boundaries which are pretty broad. My position because it can be tedious has the freedom to take frequent breaks to refresh my eyes. Co-workers are good. I personally do not know of any of the typical office drama.
good,Was my first job and it was a great experience to go through. Started as a bagger and moved my way up because I was hungry enough to move up the ranks.
good,"A typical day at work is we would start off by assisting customers with deli items"
good,"my current job is good. I am most a production operator . come in and check dates and out of codes, expiration dates and rotation as well and fixing and stocking  items on floor assuring that its followed to schematic thru sprouts regulations. along with creating list of items and products that will be needed for the day in priority order. and through out the day work on all items making sure that 80% or more has been completed before shift is over."
good,"Great Customer, Short Staff, Not a lot of team players, management skills are horrible, GREAT PRODUCE PRODUCTS, Seafood products are very reasonable. Employees get 15% discount"
good,"I loved it there. The atmosphere, the people, management, the customers, the place in general. I really couldn't find one thing to complain about, It's a really great place to work."
good,"Good Place to work. Its a lot of PLU numbers to learn and remember. Nevertheless, you get learn them over time. "
good,"Sprouts was a good company to work for the employees for the most part were fun to work with and helped out when necessary, Management was not that great as they weren't the best at managing employees the proper way or making the schedule correctly so we have adequate help on the busy days that we need employees. I got full time hours and medical insurance. The pay was great at 9.00 a hour. I was a courtesy clerk so I was bagging groceries, pushing carts in for customers, and cleaning restrooms, at night I would help the stock crew out if needed."
good,"Walk the store, check stock and get the team for 5 minute meeting."
good,Typical day at work was stocking and restocking all produce. This job taught me how to be more organized and responsible. Staff was really helpful and treated you like if you were part of the family.
good,"I love working here. Everyone is nice, they help when needed, and very flexible with your work schedule."
good,Sprouts FM offers great opportunity for career advancement in the company. There is also diversity in job type and location which makes it a great career company.
good,It’s perfect it’s a comfortable company and they have to manny opportunity’s
good,its was a pleasure being a part of the sprouts store location 239 for the 3 years that I had been there. we managed to piece together a good team and did pretty well competing with the surrounding sprouts in the local area.
good,"This company is very much about making the customer happy. The hardest part of this job is the attitude of some people who shop at the store. ""Best part of job is the fact I have no stress, work does not go home with me."
good,Sprouts is a good job to start learning new skills and it also gives you a sense of urgency and a place of belonging. One of  the most important things is that you learn how to communicate with various different people.
good,So far this seems like an amazing place to work. The hiring representative was nice an explained everything perfectly. My manager is very helpful and its very easy to get in touch with her for any reason.
good,"I had a wonderful experience working at Sprouts. We had a great management team and friendly staff, even some life long friends. Even most customers were great. Honestly I would still be at Sprouts Farmer's Market, but we moved out of state and there was not a store to transfer to."
good,"I’ve been with the company for about two years; started in Deli and got promoted as Taste Ambassador/Supervisor. I enjoy what I do and my management appreciates my hard work and input for the jobs I’m assigned to. I am a person of many hats within the store I work in and it is a very lively and rewarding experience. Sometimes I help in the meat department, sometimes I jump into the grocery area and help bag groceries or fetch carts. Sometimes I prep meals and samples for customers to enjoy. Every day is different and that’s what makes it all the more enjoyable in my experience. I’m grateful for this job and I am hoping to apply to be an assistant grocery manager before the year is out. I appreciate my team and fellow coworkers immensely and I can’t wait to see what else I can learn from this company."
good,"Typical work experience"
good,Very easy going environment! Everyone there is sure to make you laugh. It’s very easy to make friends with all of the workers. All tasks are very simple.

good,"Everyday at Sprouts Farmers Market there was always something to do and always a reason to keep busy. Co-workers were friendly, managers did a decent job, and work was fun and fast paced most the time. Hardest part of the job for me was the occasional bad weather when rounding up the carts, and the most enjoyable part was dealing with customers."
good,Very routine based job. Learned more than I expected about product attributes. Management always fair and honest. The culture was consistent with the mission statement. The most challenging part of the job was finding time for everyone to take their computer courses. The most enjoyable part of the job was when everyone completed their computer courses and applied them to their job
good,"Sprouts is a great place to work if you want a good environment involving customer service with good corporate management,  good co-workers and lots of chance of quick advancement.  That being said, one does need to put in the effort.  There is lots of training on computer modules along with peer training as well.  Customers are friendly and regular so it is easy to establish a connection.  The pace is quick but with a laid-back feel. There is a great employee discount for super healthy food, vitamins, supplements, body and beauty products and quarterly employee appreciation days where employees receive a larger discount and ""catered"" (either by management or brought in) breakfasts or lunches. There were also rewards for going above and beyond in the form of Star discount cards. Additionally, Sprouts does many things to give back to their local communities and charities.  One way they do this is to reduce food waste by supporting local food banks and churches with things like leftover bread and bakery products, produce and dairy products. They also work diligently to educate regarding healthy lifestyles and to do innovative things to reduce their carbon footprint. "

good,"Sprouts is a very great job to have. You have structured set tasks to complete everyday, job security, and advancement.  The hardest part about the job is keeping up with the workload, but the best part of the job is the rewards for your hard labor, such as things like increased pay or even gift cards."

Advancement opportunities were very good in less than six months starting as a bagger I was offered a cashiers position and the bakery from the bakery manager.
good,"A typical work day would be helping customers with checking out grocery and other items.  Sometimes helping them find items they couldn't locate.  I also would face the shelves and keeping the front of the store clean and organized.  If needed, I would bring in shopping carts from the parking lot.  The managers would show appreciation to the employees by bringing in food or desserts items.  They would have competitions so we could win items or gift cards to the store.  I learned that I really enjoyed meeting people and I could make a persons day with a smile.  The hardest part of the job, would be the customers that weren't nice.  Overall I really enjoyed the time I worked at Sprouts.  I met some new friends I worked with and I was able to be of service to our customers."

good,Clock in; Inventory(Check to see if there was enough produce items in the deli) Ran to back storage and stocked up on the produce I would need for the day(Making sandwiches and back stock) Next I checked the front cooler and stocked deli meat as well as made sure nothing was expired or close to it. Then I went to the cooler to check the meat back stock and to pull the meats I'd need to cut for the day as well as the cheese. I'd spend the next two to three hours slicing meats and cheese; Wrapping and labeling. During that I would be making sandwiches for customers who stopped by. I also was a closer and did all the duties related to that.
good,Company is great overall. Hours are flexible and fair. Management goes above and beyond for both the workplace and their employees. Only objection would be that certain employees are unreliable and slack greatly during the job.
good,Fun and simple position with friendly coworkers.  Learned how to work fast and efficiently while being friendly with customers and helping them acquire their needs.

good,I started at sprouts last year in March as a curtesy clerk in the front end for about a year then I got transferd over to the produce department doing there floral.
good,The work was a steady flow of customers sometimes with lines waiting for service deli. The staff are fun and always willing to help one another. I believe this is a great company for college kids looking for part time work as the hours can sometimes be limited and distributed to staff. Management were always on the lookout to spot where help was needed most. The culture is like no other. The employees are relaxed and willing to work. I never had a problem finding people to cover a shift. The hardest part of the job was when the staff was limited and the customers were impatient waiting for lines to go down especially during lunch times at the service deli. I learned that if you follow the rules and guidelines it makes the department run smoothly with little room for error. The most enjoyable part of the job was become part of a family with my fellow coworkers and our faithful customers.
