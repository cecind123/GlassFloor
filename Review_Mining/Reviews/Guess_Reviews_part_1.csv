rating,review
bad,this company does not care about any of its employees. It only thing they care about is benefiting themselves. Super shady. A lot of unnecessary rules
bad,"Main manager was completely unprofessional with co-workers giving them attitude and talking down on them completely ruining the friendly work environment! If you had a problem with the managers and you asked for the Human Resources number for the company you’d be threatened to be fired as they take the question as a threat to themselves! Little to no hours, no consideration for employees when it came to calling in sick or requesting a day off. Do not recommend! They ask for a lot but don’t pay you enough!"
bad,I was the only person who was a person of colour and the rest were Eastern European’s they would speak about me behind my back in their language. Horrible place to work. They fired me because I didn’t say hello to the head manager (they gave me no warning). They bullied me and made me feel very uncomfortable. This was at STRATFORD WESTFIELD. They always watched me through their cameras to try and catch me out and tell me off. Everyone else was allowed to do what they wanted whereas when it came to me they would always try to catch me out. They spoke to me rudely I advise you do not apply to work there if you’re a person of colour. Very racist and very rude group of people
bad,"The store manager of the Orlando Premium Terrica  is a lack of respect, lack of professionalism treats the employee and managers very badly in my retail life I have never had a boss as disrespectful as she did and the worst that anyone does anything."
bad,"Métodos de gestión de la empresa y de formación anticuados, mala coordinación en general. Salario bajo, obligan a hacer horas extras sin ser retribuidas."
bad,"I liked the people I worked with except the wage and the management. Also we would get 1 break out of 6 days we would work, just because management could decide who gets to go for break and who doesn't, abuse of power. The breaks that are legally placed in order were never obeyed. Also we used to get discounts on Guess originals but were later taken away. no more discounts on Guess Originals."
bad,Worst company to work for. Outdated fast fashion. Jeans are uncomfortable as well. Management is disgustingly mal trained and old lady’s work here that do nothing.
bad,The culture of this company was hands down the worst. Turnover is SUPER high! The company doesn’t care about building tenured associates or long lasting relationships with customers. If your use to a customer driven company that loves their customers. This will probably not be the place for you.
bad,If I could give 0 stars I would. I was unpaid and always forced to work longer hours then scheduled for. Barely got breaks and they never honored my school schedule.
bad,"En esta empresa  se valora mucho más lo físico que la valía de las personas "
bad,Part time workers are expected to treat this job as if it is all that matters in their life. Senior and more experienced workers are not treated according to their experience.
bad,"terrible place to work - unfair working conditions. too much work, too little time and the compensation provided is not suffice.  no job security. never enough hours aways cutting hours for staff.- long hours . early stars and late endings."
bad,"Uniformes: Te obligan a ir maquillada al 100%, pelo limpio siempre, tacones para trabajar, y te ponen un vestido “muy bonito” los Sábados. Vamos, que no sabes si eres dependienta o una Azafata."
bad,"Lack of communication between all three managers and associates. Managers are immature. Will hire you and not contact you for 1 month. Do not waste your time at the Birch Run, MI location."
bad,"I do not recommend working for GUESS. Employees get shifts based on the performed sales. So, in a case when there is not enough sales/customers (someone can simply steal your sales at the register) and put the referral to themselves. Hence, system does not show any of the dollar, you have sold. It is hard to prove to managers that it was your sale as well. Immature work environment with a lot of stress and managers making associates compete with one another."
bad,"Mi valoracion es negativa muy desfavorable, nunca he visto tanto descontrol en una empresa, la encargada amenazaba a sus trabajadores si no estaba el almacen ordenado como si fuera un colegio, muy mal pagado, entre a la empresa con unas condiciones y luego eran otras, me ha defraudado la marca."
bad,Legal/Travel Assistant with various duties assisting the directors of the company and the in-house counsel; working travel; legal documentation; including but not limited to working on fraud and trademark infringement
bad,"working at Guess is horible. They never give you enough hrs. they have floating shifts which you have to call in for then they""ll let you know if they need you or not. management isn't great. they don't schedule hours correctly. they try and squeeze so much clothes on the sales floor that it's impossible to search for a size without making a mess of everything, closing shifts do not leave until about 1 am or later sometimes."
bad,"Not even the manager interviewed me or even read my resume which clearly read that I had another job I was currently working. A month after getting hired (I wasn't even phoned by the manager that I had been hired) I finally got a shift and she booked over my other job. I tried to resolve the problem but any solution I provided was thrown into my face and wasn't ""reasonable"" even though it was all I could do... I ended up having to quit because she couldn't deal with my other job I wasn't willing to quit for a brand new job and yelled at me almost every day, at work I was yelled at because I was 10 minutes early and not the minimum 20 minutes she required from staff that we weren't paid for (I went to University literally across the city and my last class ended 40 minutes before my shift started)... It's been 2 months since I had to quit due to stress and abuse from a new job and I still haven't received a cheque from my month of work... I DO NOT think this is a suitable job for anyone."
bad,"On my first week I worked 31-32 hours and then i was never called back to work. I called 3 different times to know when I'm suppose to come back to work. Two weeks go by and on payday I looked at my bank account I was only paid $50, immediately called them to find out why I haven't gotten paid the right amount. All I got was unreasonable excuses and at one point I was told to fix it myself by phoning up ADP and talk to them. In them same phone call (even though I already knew) i was told i was let go but never given a reason why and then one of the 20 supervisors told me they would call me back and it never happened. "
bad,"This place was unorganized, the manager would leave for hours go home and will leave us in the store alone for hours. I wouldn’t recommend  this place at all"
bad,"bazig, rodellen achter je rug om "
bad,"Horrible turnover rate due to poor management with no sense of compassion. Immature staff. Poor compensation at all levels, lack of compensation for level of responsibility."
bad,"À bout, j'ai démissionné de ce poste après 8 mois."
bad,"These folks have no idea what they are doing and need complete retraining in their entire company. So many loose ends, employees not getting paid correctly. This job was a nightmare."
bad,"Une entreprise qui ne connaît pas les droits du travail ni les droit de l’homme ! Salaires déplorables où il faut systématiquement surveiller les fiches de paies car très souvent des oublis ( a croire qu’ils font exprès) "
bad,Treated horrible no room for advancement no incentives the dm is a body shamer very rude the manager smoke marijuana and normally smells of it during her shifts
bad,Guess under pays associates and managers and you have to sell sell sell with no commission and all my time there my store NEVER got any incentive. Associates also never get regonized when they do a good job. Coperate handle most issues poorly and make you lose morale to work. I have seen them let go of people for absolutely stupid reason that could have been handled better.
bad,The management team is absolutely ridiculous. I have never ever hated my job this much. Absolutely horrible. The management team is having everyone quit. Customers hated associates because of what the managers were making us do.
bad,they don't value their employee thats why they hire teenagers without any experience avoid at all cost if you can not worth it at all. they won't give you a raise ever
bad,"I worked at the GUESS Factory at the Tanger Outlets in Deer Park NY and it was horrible. If you are considering working there, don't. Not only are the customers nasty but management is as well. They talk down to you and have an attitude. It is not a good environment to be in. There is no chance for advancement and they don't give raises unless you get promoted. You deal with too much stress for what they pay you, it's not worth it"
bad,"All of the employees are not professional. The enviornment is like high school, nothing but gossip and talking smack about other co workers. Do not work here, it is a waste of your time. Its full of fake people and lies."
bad,"Working at Guess is very slow, you dont get paid good at all. Also, the management is not good. Please leave while you can. Honestly, each day was a drag, and you dont work that many hours."
bad,Clocking in to a chaotic mess most days. Having to catch up on shipment and normal recovery because lack of coverage due to high turn over. Cashiering was easiest to do as well as the fitting room because I like to be organized and clean.
bad,"Assunta come stagista, per 400€ al mese e 48 ore di lavoro. Continuamente tenuta sotto pressione, si arrabbiavano se non raggiungevi i target giornalieri minacciandoti, avevano da ridire su tutto anche quando non ce ne era alcun motivo. Nonostante cercavo di dare il massimo, venivo demoralizzata e sottovalutata. Me ne sono andata per disperazione perché più che un lavoro era un vero e proprio sfruttamento del personale."
bad,It was not great at all. A company that forces you to buy their clothes every month or so without providing it for free to you is a scam. Those CEO's are cheap and full of themselves.
bad,"Clothes are to expensive and made extremely cheap "
bad,Eh I didn’t really enjoy my time here. We were always understaffed. Management was very inconsistent. The regular hourly staff was fun to be around though.
bad,PIRE EXPERIENCE je ne recommande pas cette société
bad,"A typical day at work required meeting sales targets. I learned different sales techniques, management was unprofessional. The hardest part of the job was meeting sales goals."
bad,This was my dream job and became my worst nightmare. My DM was manipulative and didn't care about the employees at all. I had a complaint with HR and they didn't even care about how serious my issue was. This job only  helped me to know where I DID NOT want to work ever.
bad,"Conditions de travail déplorable"
bad,It's a shame that a big company like Guess don't care about their employees and they always make you stay extra hours plus no benefits besides discounts that is basically all your job they don't help you grow professionally and they are racist in some way they have their type of people to work for the company I wouldn't recommend it at all
bad,No room for advancement working here. Work very hard for little pay. Mean managers and district manager. Everyone keeps quitting. This company needs to learn how to run a business properly. Everyone seems so negative here
bad,"Poor work environment"
bad,"was not the best place to work, lots of drama and backstabbing. they do not work together as a team and need to learn how to help and care for their staff"
bad,They lay off for anything. Not very job safety type of environment or company. Very Corporate. They do not promote within. Only good thing is the caffe
bad,"I dislike everything about this job from the schedules, work place environment, extremely unorganized, and high pressure and stress job. Do not appreciate their employees"
bad,Terrible working place would not recommend. They have awful people skills and treat assosiates unfairly. Also barely gave hours and fired people without saying a work to them.
bad,this store is no longer around. but it wasn't too bad. the bags were nice. the staff was nice. the location in the mall was decent. close to the food court
bad,"the management is terrible and very unprofessional. They do not fully train anyone but expect you to know everything and get mad when something is done incorrectly. management is very rude, and do not take responsibility when something doesnt get done, they blame the associates and make them fix or finish tasks that were too much for one associate to complete in a 4 hour shift."
bad,"GUESS is very behind in the times of technology. They have a very high turnover rate and it's due to the work lie balance. You are scheduled for a certain amount of hours, expected to work 10+ that amount but end up working 20+ that amount. There is no time for any employee to have a successful personal life and work there."
bad,A typical day of my work all task done and well manage with proper coordination and communication with the team and store managers with great end result.
bad,The pay is low. Maybe 3 or 4% raises. The management is very mediocre and under trained. They are very much into playing favorites and talking behind your back. Don't lower yourself to the type of environment Guess has settled on providing here. You can do better.
bad,"Store 3260 has went down it seems, the store had lost 98 percent of the original employees that were there when I started. The hours are a joke and expect to work a second job. Advancement in the store is another joke. The store manager also can't handle stress..."
bad,"There is no way to put it, working at guess was a bad place and not very enjoyable for me. The management was unprofessional they chose favorites, the hours sucked only got one day a week on a full time position and they always messed up the schedule, and the wage was not that great either."
bad,I did not like working here. i was seasonal and they did not value me at all. a complete waste of time. The pay was ok but the benefits sucked
bad,fun work place depending on the day. Management can be moody. As for the coworkers great people. They are more so like a close-knit family in some aspects.
bad,"Trendy clothing chain with a California aesthetic, selling the brand's denim, apparel & accessories.  I was a member of a small, under-resourced team responsible for the design and development of net positive products."
bad,"All my jobs are great experience, even though it's not always easy but I try to do my best and give a great performance, some boss were nicer than others but I never let that get to me. I am an happy person. I learned to be patient with people. the hardest part of the job is also the easiest which is keeping the customers happy so they can come back.  I currently work for Guess and I love all my bosses, my co-workers are like family and that's what's help me do a great job. I am a go getter. I believe you give 150 percent and whatever you do. Money is important but don't let it be only reason you come to work otherwise you won't do a great job."
bad,Loved the sales associates that I helped develop and train. They are the key to why I stayed at Guess for 5 years. Other than that the company has done a poor job with establishing clear communication with it's staff which made it hard to operate on a day to day.
bad,Low pay and long grueling hours. there is no room to grow and if you don't know anyone within the company then you on get far. a lot of favoritism and management is all females and they are very catty and immature.
bad,"If you like pathetic hourly rates, no raises, and new rules everyday then this is the place for you!"
bad,"If i had the chance to give no stars I would. Management was clueless and schedules for the new work weed were made by Saturday. Those working sunday it was almost impossible to find out because saturdays are so busy that no one answers the phone. No schedule is uploaded or emailed. Poor organization. Everyone thinks they're a boss. No sense of team work. Probably why many workers didn't stay long, myself included. Sales associates left often, and mangers stayed because they thought they were the be all and end all. overall nothing good to say other then the discount. "
bad,the worst managment ive ever worked under. in store theft was happening with the managers
bad,"Opening the store, managing employees, up holding corporate standards, maintaining loss prevention, and constant great customer service. "
bad,Surpassed monthly department sales quota. Assisted in the training and interviewing of new staff. Organized and facilitate stock room and new merchandise.
bad,"co-workers are fantastic- the true meaning of a work family. however, the expectations vs. pay are ridiculous. to make it short and sweet, you are expected to do as parents said they did (walk 500 miles in the snow over hills for 3 hours) to get to a minimum wage job. management does not care about your well-being, few of them are truly good leaders, and the company does not respect it's employees. it's fun to learn about fashion and connect with customers who sometimes even become friends, but it's not worth being pushed to sell people things they don't want the second they step in. a typical day at work during slow season involves people not getting enough hours and then struggling because there aren't enough people working, and adding on items until people are annoyed. if you want to work here, you should be financially stable and available all the time- but don't expect to be full time."
bad,"I came to Guess as a part-time gig after I had left my other job working luxury retail (I know big mistake) at first the manager seemed chill, and the work environment did not seem crazy so I accepted the job offer. Immediately I noticed red flags (not being given an official first day I had to call). Took weeks just to get me on the schedule, they spelt my name wrong on the schedule and never even bothered to fix it, and were giving me 10-12 hours a week which is not money I can live off of. They would not match my pay from my previous job so I was definitely getting underpaid for my experience and was overqualified. The staff was very mean to me and definitely did not make me feel welcomed there there was only like two coworkers I liked there and one assistant manager the rest of the staff was very mean, unwelcoming, gossipy, and just not classy. Literally one of the managers would straight up start screaming at me to talk to clients in front of the customers which is like #1 no no in high end retail what you do is greet and wait and observe to see if they need assistance, then approach but no they made us pester the clients to the point the clients were annoyed. Huge micro-managing problem at the store I worked at and poor communication among staff. I was harassed about my looks nearly everyday working which is so unprofessional and at times made me feel uncomfortable coming into work. The dress code is sexist and men can wear whatever they want but the females are expected to wear heels and makeup. They were very pushy about sales goals and the sales floor was super sharky"
bad,"All I’ll say is it’s the most unfair place to work, the manager is extremely rude to her employees not to mention I’ve witness how nasty she can be with customers. She lies she never works the full hours she supposed to work. She would “forget” to clock out. All in all it was the worst place I’ve ever worked to the point I dreaded waking up in the morning to go."
bad,Management is racist and unprofessional. I was let go during my two week notice as retaliation for expressing to my district manager that unfair practices and racially discriminative conversations were had with me. I wa told by my black GM that I have to conform to white America.
bad,The worst work that I have.. Poor organitation.. The Store mánager treat the Associate like de are nothing... So disrespectful........................
bad,"The Guess Factory in Riverhead, NY was not the experience i would recommend to a friend. The management team lacks the professionalism they believe they have by mistreating their staff. Associates do the brunt of the work. Management will bad mouth employees and wonder why very few of them stay."
bad,The management at this place  treated everyone that was under them like they was beneath them.  It was always a battle when things need to be done. I would never recommend for anyone to work here.
bad,would not recomend this employer. Management is not around when needed and will not provide positive feedback. Instead snotty people from upper management come into the store to point out everything that you are doing wrong without providing solutions.
bad,"Je ne conseille pas cette entreprise j'y ai travaillé pendant 1 an, au début tout allait bien j'ai toujours réalisé le chiffre puis ils sont devenus hypocrites et ensuite m'ont accusé à tort pour trouver un motif de licenciement. Conditions de travail déplorable , la réserve n'est pas au norme attention aux accidents de travail , salle de pause c'est la réserve."
bad,göründüğü gibi bir firma degildir ucretleri iyi gelsede sizi orda calisma ortaminda huzursuz etmek icin hic tahmin edemeyeceginiz seylerle sıkıştırırlar calisanlarini surekli yenileme politikasi olan bir firmadir yani siz ise girdim diye sevinirken sizin son kullanma tarihiniz yonetim tarafindan belirlenmistir. boyle bir ise girdiginiz zaman yine is aramayi birakmayin cunku 3 5 ay icinde 15 20 kisilik personelin 10 a yakını degisti.diyelim ki girdiniz satislar dusmeye baslayinca magaza duzenindeki ufak tefek kusurlari bile devasa problemler haline getiriyorlar ana yonetim kadrosu toplaniyor bu tur malca konular icin gerisini siz dusunun .turkiyedeki en ust yonetici takimi haric geri kalan yonetim kadrosu capulcu dolu . personele deger asla yok gidin simit satın bu firmanin haydutlarina kendinizi ezdirmeyin
bad,"È un’azienda che si presenta come internazionale, ma gestita in maniera poco professionale, nessuna organizzazione e nessuna possibilità di crescita all’interno. Un’azienda fatta di tante parole ma pochi fatti! Per non parlare del modo in cui trattano le risorse... solo numeri e pettegolezzi..... più che Internazionale potrei paragonarla alla gestione di un mini market rionale a gestione familiare (senza offese per questi)."
bad,Guess isn't really a good place to work only because they give favoritism to certain people. And you didn't receive any benefits or sick days or even pay days if there was a family emergency. The pay isn't that great either and it was just extremely hard and not a very organized company at all.
bad,Guess Inc. is an unfulfilling place to work for individuals who appreciate creativity and idea collaboration environment. The owner runs the company in a very fear driven manner. There is not much excitement to daily job duties. No sense of reward for individuals work produced.
bad,"working a minimum wage retail store is not an ideal opportunity for me. I am seeking a challenging position in a sales, marketing and customer service environment."
bad,"A typical day at work is to be on the sales floor, managing the staff and ensuring exceptional customer service experience. We are understaffed and the entire store, including management are disgruntled with their work life."
bad,Worked here for a couple of months. Didnt really like it. The pay was ok but you didnt get much hours. The women were very drama filled and the managers were just as immature. But Im just speaking for the store I worked for. I wont say its for every store.
bad,"Horrible work atmosphere. My manager lied to me a lot, a lot of false write ups and terminations to sales associates. No positive feedback. Concerns were never addressed by head office"
bad,"The politics for this company is ridiculous. They give you a ""call-in"" 3 days out of 7, where they may or may not need you, without any actual hours for atleast two weeks. So, if you dont work for two weeks you have no paycheck by your next pay period. They pay minimum wage and expect you to buy their over priced clothes. Ofcourse you have to wear the companies clothes, but if you make minimum wage, only had 4 hours of work for 2 weeks and the discount is only 40 percent- there goes most if not all of your paycheck."
bad,"Très peu à l ecoute de son personnel,ne vous demande pas si vous voulez travailler les jour fériés à la limite de l obligation car sinon on vous dit que vous n avez pas envie de travailler, emploi du temps transmis le samedi 19h pour le lundi matin .je ne recommande vraiment pas cette entreprise"
bad,"The store when I was hired was a complete and utter mess including the  stained toilet. I with help of my amazing staff cleaned up the entire store. We did receive visual guidance from a self entitled, demeaning woman from Vancouver.  She failed to recognize that my staff was a very new and instead of inspiring and coaching she was very rude. That’s not my style of  leadingleading.ateam. They would sent a amazing . woman from Calgary to coach me on all of the administrative duties."
bad,"En la entrevista laboral ya vi la prepotencia  de la plantilla "
bad,"-Had to nag customers over and over again"
bad,"Never paid me owed money, defrauded other employees and vendors, fraudulently represented lied to repeatedly by CEZO who was later arrested also sexually harassed by ceo"
bad,I was employed at guess for 5yrs and was told multiple times that i wasn't going to receive a raise nor grown in my field of management. The district manager is bias and the turnover rate for the management is ridiculous. If you're looking to grown within a company this is NOT the place for you.
bad,"This company plays on favorites. You may have good ideas or be a good worker but if you rub the wrong person the wrong way or they feel threaten by you, you will have no place to advance. "
bad,"Mind numbing, dull, non-inspiring-- no team environment. Extremely micromanaged and really not a fun place to work. No excitement in day to day culture-- no incentive to staff, no room for growth. LA's DM is condescending and unhelpful. AVOID working here."
bad,the managers are stressful they judge you for how you look if your not wearing guess apparel if your makeup is natural or not . what you eat everthing
bad,"Both my Manager and District Manager left the company within 6 weeks of me starting, the new management staff acted like a bunch of high school kids in a popularity contest."
bad,It is very strictly managed with little to no compensation or work benefits.  The managers don't give much thought about their employees.  Managers would copy and paste schedules when hours are meant to be determined by sales per hour (sph).  There was a lack of communication amongst managers and sales associates.  Managers lacked taking responsibility for their store and often blamed sales associates.  Favoritism was involved.  Even though I was top sales associate for several months because I got paid more I'd received less hours compared to everyone else during times of cutting back.  Overall not a good experience.  I learned a lot but the process was grueling and majority of the time unpleasant and stressful.
bad,"To be blatantly honest the only reason you stay at this company is if the team is good - make sure you like the group that hires you, otherwise it'll be torture."
bad,"Guess asks for way too much from you for them not to pay commission at least. They expect you to sell minimum $1400 goals .. basically you help the store make over $10,000 a day to get paid only like $25 after taxes. OH AND THE HOURS THEY GIVE YOU ARE ***!!! EXPECT TO WAIT 2 WEEKS FOR A *** CHECK.  smh."
bad,"You have to earn your hours through your sales. I had no problem with that until they started cutting my hours. You see I closed most of the time and for a work day you only get 4 hrs . Anyways I would drive everyday wasting my gas for 4hrs. Wait , no that was if I was lucky. Bec they would cut me off or send me home after 3hrs. You see the managers work do what is best for company why because the ones that benign from it.  I could go on but if I do I would never finish."
bad,"Workers were nice but managers was not freindly and were racist towards non-white people."
bad,"Store Manager demanded work to be done, but didn't do anything. Management from store manager and district manager did not care about safety of employees. Stayed very late every night after closing to clean the store. The entire mall and parking lot would be empty & dark. When I came up with a better solution my idea was shut down and rediculed. When complaints about Store Manager were sent to District Manager she eithered did nothing or try to write people up for complaining."
bad,Before working at Guess I absolutely loved the company and the clothing! When I started working there I found out how bad the store culture was among the managers. The managers would talk behind each others backs a lot and they created a very toxic environment. The hardest part of the job was trying to be properly trained but instead managers were too busy trying on clothes and gossiping about other managers and associate's that it made it extremely difficult to concentrate. Certain managers would not work all day and then when you come in they pass all the work on to you. This was the most toxic work environment I have ever experienced and it was only because of the people that worked at this location. Unfortunately if you speak up to the higher-ups they seem to not care and do nothing about the situation. Even though they know the store environment is very poor they still did not try to bring it right back up. I still love Guess clothing which is why I decided to take the job but the job was still stressful due to the lack of hours and there only being one manager and one associate working throughout the entire day. I will still continue to shop at Guess because the clothing is nice but I will never recommend to work there especially at this location. This means more work for you at such little pay. On top of that at this location there are a lot of call outs which lead to more work on the managers but of course nothing was or will be done about this.
bad,Empresa pesima la cual como encargada note forma no hay ayudas por parte de superiores jerarquicos faltan al respeto insultan te hablan mal no hay gestion no hay profesionalidad no existe el orden no tienen prioridades no tienen organizacion no saben actuar ante problemas que surgen en la tienda solo te culpabilizan por todo sin tener formacion alguna
bad,"the hardest retailer to work for, they pay poor they do not promote within and do not care for their people. dont work for guess. the ceo is a pervert that only likes to see women showing skin"
bad,"Great pay "
bad,"iedereen werkt volgens hun eigen regels. de meeste managers hebben geen opleiding gehad, ze zijn onbeschoft en hebben geen manieren."
bad,"I'm expected to drop my personal life at any moment the store needed something. I missed my own anniversary, missed numerous family get togethers. The DM told me to enjoy my last deer hunting weekend with my husband because I couldn't have that weekend off again.  And the DM didnt seem to care. Rarely got texts or calls back."
bad,"Absolutely the worst place to work. Never work here. The managers are so rude and they treat employees unfairly. They give you no hours and when they do they always give you 5 hour shifts so you never get a break. The employees that work there are fine. Its just the managers, their attitudes are so nasty. Not a fun environment to work in."
bad,"Se exige bastante en Guess, pero lo malo es que las encargadas no forman y pretenden que sepas todo y es imposible cuando no dedican nada de tiempo a enseñar y cuando preguntas algo, te miran mal. Para decirte todo lo que haces mal, no tienen problema alguno en dedicar 24h del dia."
bad,Was not able to make sales due to the store not having enough GUESS materials. Was only able to work 1 day every week. Was also not getting paid enough. Learn to not take up retail again.
bad,"In-store management spread to thin while upper management gave no in-store support.  Also, companies sole concern seemed to be payroll budget, not the guest."
bad,-Poor management to worker communication.
bad,Being treated unfairly as an employee can't keep employees because either attitude towards employees  doesn't keep up with code of cleanliness  ridiculous parking
bad,"Good team and management. Sales were competitive and the commission brought tension amongst staff members. Retail is always enjoyable during the busy season, outside of that it was slow."
bad,"micromanaged, catty, decent discount off clothes is a big incentive to not quit your job. some of the employees are awesome, but that's about it."
bad,"The Lakeside Guess store is horrible!!! The working environment itself isn't too bad but the management is dreadful.  I barely learned anything from this job. The first two months went well but after that i've been asking for more hours because I wasn't receiving any hours. The manager was not responding to any of my messages. Also, I have told her face to face that i wasn't getting any but she told me that their was a manager going in training so no one is really getting any hours. After that I still tried texting the manager and she wasn't responding for 2 months straight. I do not recommend anyone to work here if you are trying to get more hours. She even hired more people and gave them hours but not me. Last thing, You don't even get paid well and don't even get hours..."
bad,"Working with guess was not a permanent place to work, employees were great, manager was not understanding of needing more hours, no room to grow with company and no benefits offered"
bad,it was a co-op work I wasn't there for a long time but it was a great experience for me I learned a lot about detail business
bad,"Mi raccomando non lasciate il Vs attuale lavoro per entrare alle GUESS a Stabio o Lugano, nel tempo vi pentirete perche e un azienda che non offre spazio di crescita professionale a chi  merita, ma solo a chi ha santi in paradiso."
bad,guess standards are way too high.i was 18 when I got the job and felt like if I was not dressed a certain way I could not get the job done. Girls are sexualized by managers and customers. Honestly terrible company. if you didn't make your sale goals you wouldn't get hours lol.
bad,"Given the HUNDREDS of employees - the structure of the company consists of several key players that do not ever communicate with one another, and as a result the work becomes ineffective."
bad,"Nonostante ho imparato un nuovo lavoro, sinceramente la gestione di questo magazzino non era soddisfacente, per il tipo di persona seria, con tantissima voglia di lavorare e capacità lavorative in quasi tutte le mansioni che ho svolto. Ho riscontrato poca capacità nella gestione del personale."
bad,"The management is awful, Its so competitive and stressful trying to make sure that you made your goals and doing your job at the same time which isn't easy. The managers had attitudes and they treated me really bad. When I quit , they easily replaced me."
bad,it is an okay working environment. you get to help customers and gain customer service experience. you spend a lot of time folding clothes and making sure everything looks neat
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people everyday and assisting them. Fashion is always fun, so trying on the clothes to  know how they fit give you the ability to help the customers in the best way."
bad,Fun work place with pop music filled atmosphere. A lot of culture walks in and out of the doors. Hectic during holidays which is great.
bad,Nothing was ever good enough. People were often scapegoats for other people and you would here more about what youre doing wrong rather than aknowledgement when you did something right.
bad,"worst position I have ever had, terrible management. Over worked under paid."
bad,"Workers are nice, but the management want a lot from you.... Drama working there."
bad,"The turn over rate at this company is Horrible. There are not enough employees to balance out the amount of traffic that visits this store. The management team is clueless and you are not trained properly due to the shortage of not only management, but the sales team as well. I do not recommend this company"
bad,The hardest part of the job was trying to learned how to deal with constantly being discriminated against and not getting enough hours because of favoritism.
bad,"GUESS Factory at Ontario MIlls is a productive workplace. I do not recommend this location as they do not clean thoroughly, they just clean what customers see firsthand."
bad,"•	Received extensive retail training including sales and conversion, customer service, merchandising and upselling."
bad,"Management worked you like a dog without keeping in mind that you were a student. IMPOSSIBLE to call in sick or have an emergency, they tell you to come in any ways. Absolutely no compassion, management cares more about making comp. The only enjoyable part about my expense working there, was my co-workers."
bad,"This is a horrible company to work for, the management is out of control. Unfair practices, skipping breaks, & favoritism are prevolent here. This company & the higher management is not one you want to work for."
bad,"Guess was a terrible place for me to work. I had many changes in managers. My first set of managers were very good at managing Guess and the employees there. They were very helpful and friendly and encouraged good competition with the other employees. However, once I got a change in managers, there was a question of work ethics. The competition to make sales goals was difficult and turned into a bad game with even the managers. I would work really hard to help customers with their fitting rooms and finding the right clothes to buy, my managers would take my sales. In turn, I would get in trouble for not making my sales goals."
bad,If you enjoy customer service this is going to be a fine job for you. If you don't then don't even consider this. There are also no opportunities for promotion
bad,The bosses and upper management are full of it. They give you no commission for sales. They are constantly screaming at you( for nothing). They do not give you the proper training & there product is garbage.
bad,"meet and greet different people"
bad,"Minimum wage pay"
bad,"poor management, low pay and no core values and too much turnover and politics"
bad,Would never recomend anyone to this company. bad leadership and management.
bad,"Management doesn't accommodate for their sales associates and cares for these human beings only for sales floor coverage. They have a lack of maturity by spreading lies and rumors about current and former employees. Management also very often schedule associates to where they aren't ""allowed"" to take a break. They will throw other employees under the bus for the sake of covering their own behinds."
bad,"Firma ktora podczas rozmowy rekrutacyjnej obiecuje gruszki na wierzbie a po tygodniu dochodzi do normalnosci. Przelozeni nie sa proawdomowni, zmieniaja zdanie jak zawieje wiatr. Decyzje nei sa podejmowane dlugoterminowo. Rzadko szanuje sie czlowiek. Pakiet socjalny nie istnieja. Zaroki na niskim poziomie, premie zalezne od targetow 60% nie osiagalne."
bad,They operate out of fear and common sense isn't that common there. its not encourage to think for yourself and when you do you're hushed. not a great environment
bad,"Management doesnt know how to deal with anything professionally. Employees get talked down to, as well as get told they dont look pretty enough to work a shift quite often. Every member of management talks about fellow management and employees behind there back, and doesnt treat anyone as part of a team. This company basically plays the blame game for everything, and is so unorganised its ridiculous, and the expectations of an employee AND manager is unrealistic. Managers also have a problem with favouring certain employees, and the pay is way too low for what youre expected to do."
bad,"hardest part of the job was upholding store policy for some customers and not for others."
bad,Management was pure chaos. Unrealistic sales goal for a small factory store. Lack of management of payroll led to poorly scheduled  shifts.
bad,"Management was very contradictory. The number of hours you worked per week depended on how many customers mentioned your name to the person ringing them out. A lot of times customers would either forget your name or not say it at all. Plus, every person was assigned to either the front, center, or back of the store and are not allowed to leave that area. If a customer comes to a person at the front of the store asking for help with an item that isn't in their area, the associate is forced to pass the customer to another associate and not receive credit for the sale."
bad,"Poorly managed. No room for career advancement and they put a cap on hours, as well as wage. Not the greatest atmosphere nor is it a place I would recommend for anyone wanting a chance to prove themselves."
bad,"I worked at Guess? full-time (Less than a year)"
bad,no work life balance at all.  company is terrible with compensation and raises and is one of the lowest paying retailers I have worked for. unrealistic
bad,Working for guess was horrible Once I revived my check I automatically waist on clothes why because the required a specific outfit on weekends and the manager had favoritism and you'll only get 20 hrs week but if your good at selling you'll get more hours. I'll admit I was on the top 3 sellers and I did get up to 28 hours but only cause I sold and always made more of my sph goal but if you don't make your sph you'll only get 20 or less hours
bad,"Vente sous pression"
bad,"*the job was bad "
bad,"Very little chances to promote"
bad,"I didn't enjoy the vision of the Guess company in the UK. I felt it was all very poorly managed, wages were getting mixed up, not getting paid on time, not getting holiday pay, having to do MUCH more than your job role and getting no thanks for it. Overall not a great place for me."
bad,"Can be fun to work there, but it is pressure sales without the commissions. "
bad,Management did not appreciate the workers. People in power took advange of there jobs. Slaved workers. I was told if Ididnt suck up to the manager I would loose my job.
bad,Min. wage
bad,"Poor Management, small volume stores are ignored by upper management. Promotions were promised on the internal level, but persons were hired from outside the company instead. Never had what was necessary to do the job correctly, company refuses to upgrade from dial up internet, after stores continually call to complain of no service or slow service and request work orders."
bad,"So for starters there is a dress code the uniform is good as depending on your contract hours you have an alloted amount to spend on guess clothes for work no one is to dress the same and you have to ask if the cloths you pick are okay, heels for ladys are a must and dress shoes for men, makeup is a must. No time to talk as the manager is on your back.. Staff are nice.."
bad,"Mala comunicación entre empleados de mismo rango, mala gestión de los mismos, y de la tienda en sí."
bad,"Would not recommend working at the Charleston location! There has been a lot of change with managment , and it has been awful! Not a great place to work at all. It is a very negative work enviornment."
bad,There was too much drama for a work environment. No one was being treated right. Management was very rude to customers. Extremely unorganized. Store was never clean. It was too stressful for a part time cashier job.
bad,"bad communication with in company, seasonal work, holiday season is not a good time to start, fast turn over of work team and management, i would not suggest working in retail with this company"
bad,"Purtroppo sconsiglio vivamente questa ditta."
bad,"Fast paced environment.  Focuses on meeting customer expectations, that many of the times  This is ideal for someone who is looking for a part-time job or as something to do temporary."
bad,"Job culture was focused around being the 'perfect person', management was unprofessional and inappropriate, often lines were burred between what was considered inappropriate and appropriate at work. Good community feeling among sales associates - DM and management had a very abusive and at times childlike relationship, lack of professionalism was a common occurrence when dealing with work place issues."
bad,"Most of my experience working here was bad I don't even shop here anymore bc of it."
bad,"Guess is a terrible place to work, they want you to up sell everything and if you do not meet your sales goal they take away your hours. They expect you to have these insanely high sales goals with no rewards."
bad,"In my opinion, working for Guess Factory store is fun but the environment and management is unprofessional. Favoritism is apparent and room for advancement is little to none."
bad,"I was responsible for answering calls, cleaning fitting rooms, styling customers, adding onto a sale, maintaining sales goals, visual merchandising, having excellent product knowledge, and processing debit/visa transactions at cash. Management was poor, once I had left guess I had formed new expectations of what I wanted from my next manager. I found the hardest part of this job was realizing that I was being walked on by management because I was shy and easily persuaded. I left feeling extremely used and unimportant they lost all my respect and trust. Although I left happy I learned how to hold my own, that having expectations from your management team is your right, and if you think you deserve something you need to take steps to get there. I mainly enjoyed this job because I was one of Guess's top ten sales associates time and time again, i loved the clothing, the style and because i was able to do visual merchandising."
bad,"A typical day at work consist of selling to the general public while completing other tasking jobs. I have learned to be a better multi tasker in general. Management is inconsistent. The hardest part of my job is dealing with too many emotions and inconsistency in general. I enjoy working with my co-workers, selling the brand and clothes in general. Overall, the company is a good company to work for as a temporary job."
bad,"Very unorganized, upper management does not motivate or encourage through creating positive morale. Turnover company wide ect."
bad,Working with Guess Inc was an unfortunate experience for me. The demand of any customer service field is extensive and money alone does not compensate for the sacrifices required.
bad,some times the place would be pack with customer and sometimes the store would be empty. Management were unorganized and annoying while pushing sales
bad,I worked part time at guess. It a retailer in most malls. I handled customers and clothing while I worked there.
bad,"Though one of the better paying retail chains, it is simply not worth the money you make. Once given the store, you are on your own. This is not to say you are autonomous, but rather that no help will be given on any level. I was hired to staff and open a store, which is not a problem, but I had one week to find and train a management team, 40+ sales associates, stock associates; while also directing the visuals, building all displays, unboxing, tagging, pricing, hanging, and steaming all product, and so forth. I held up my end of the bargain by building a solid team. Not perfect, but solid. Our controllable numbers were superb: 20-25% conversion on a weekly basis, 3+ minimum UPTs, and an ADT that never dropped below $80 on any day. Our traffic never met expectations, but also I was never given the permission to have our name put on the directory or anything to spread the word of our arrival. Mall management begged me to allow them to use our name and product to advertise the mall itself, but I was told no. Guess wants you to achieve New York goals with a slum budget. Joining this team was the worst mistake of my career"
bad,"Very chatty and gossipy upper management. District manager is very inconsistent with what is needed from the company. Not enough resources to complete goals and needs of store. If you cannot manage to multitask about 5 different things and can’t deal with inconsistent needs that are not clearly spoken, this job isn’t for you."
bad,"As your start on your team you soon become family. The long hours and endless days together do pay off. "
bad,"in my opinion, working retail is not the way to go unless you have lots of patience and some type of persuasiveness to you demeanor. the management there was not the best."
bad,"Store managers come and go, looks like they hire any store manager off the street. The staff is great but the regional, dms and store managers are the problem in the district. There is no team only if they are friends. Favoritisms at its best and other opinion don’t matter to the store manager. The other managers are great but the store manager is the problem."
bad,I worked here for about a month in the wrentham outlets and it was by far the worst job I’ve had. The managers acted as if they were babysitters yelling at us not to talk when guests were around but would talk about whatever they pleased while anyone was in the store. Unreasonable and unrealistic hours. They put me on for a week of 7 hour over nights without even asking if I would be able to DO overnights.(no they didn’t pay extra for the over nights either). I applied for part time but was  Immediately given 40 per week. (Which wouldn’t have been a problem if the work environment wasn’t so poor) and to top it all off they didn’t pay me for five weeks because of a screw up on their onboard process!! Never again.
bad,"On a daily basis , most days . You get to learn something differently. Each day we have to meet goals that are given, if not the managers are being pressure to meet it. Other than that co workers can be friendly"
bad,I didn’t enjoy going into work. There was a lot of drama. Everyone spoke horribly about each other. I was always worried what was said behind my back. The manager was gonna often. I have a severe low blood sugar issue and I needed to go to the back to eat a frontal bar fast and she gave me a cookie and told me to keep working. I just felt a lot of incompassion.
bad,Was shown many different ways to look at visual merchandising as a whole. Felt confident in my personal visual merchandising decisions for the store's needs.
bad,management was unprofessional. Along with associates only receiving under 10 hours a week. if you are full time you will receive a benefits packet. 40% discount.
bad,"Guess is a very fast paced working environment, and its better two speak more than one language when working with them so you understand what others are saying."
bad,"managers only schedule employees they get along with and that is similar to their culture. No consideration for employees who has to take the bus because they schedule everyone to stay entirely too late and people miss their buses. There have been times when i did have a break at all, or did not receive my break until it was almost time for me to clock out from my shift."
bad,bad upper management.  the dm was unable to keep a store manager at this location led to a poor work life balance and being over worked on salary guess is a dying brand and they aren't doing much to help themselves
bad,"i had liked being a retail seller. i enjoy working with the customers , yet the others didn't seem to want to be there. they were lazy and all inappropriate  in  nature. making inappropriate comments towards one another and customers as well."
bad,"I loved some of my upper management but there was such a disconnect between stores and corporate. They were working hard on fixing it, but I did not see much improvement in my time there."
bad,working here i thought it would be great but things started to change when the holidays came around. my hrs started to decrease and then the manager isn't the best there is out there.
bad,"On a typical day, I would get chatted on what I have to do and the goals I have to make. I learned information about the company and how to read and calculate certain numbers. The management would change every couple of months because of promotions, demotions, etc. I developed friendships with most of my co-workers; however, there were some I did not click with. The hardest part of the job was meeting your personal goal because our store was not really busy. Also, it was a little difficult keeping up with the dress code since management was strict about it and I was not paid enough. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with the Assistant Manager and some co-workers."
bad,"Un ambiente dove ho trovato difficoltà ad ambientarmi, poca collaborazione e personale pronto solo a vendere, con poco o senza interesse personale verso il cliente."
bad,buon gruppo di lavoro  ma lo stipendio non permettete di vivere in svizzera
bad,"Estuve trabajando en Guess unas semanas y ahora que no pertenezco a esa empresa quería contar mi experiencia:"
bad,"A typical day includes helping customers find specific items, doing transactions, pushing product to be sold, unboxing merchandise, restocking, and doing Ecom orders."
bad,District manager was not well trained and not qualified.  The culture was good in the beginning-the district manager that hired me understood the vision of the company and did well executing that.
bad,ennuyant a mourir nous sommes 9 a tourner ans le magasin pour rien vraiment decu de l'equipe
bad,"Started off with great hours ...little by little they start diminishing.After a while, most of the hours were given to cashiers or the ""inner circle"" "
bad,"I Usually work the morning shift so my job duties were cleaning windows, shelves, fitting room and bathroom all by myself. Next i had to replinsh the floor from front to back and then do put backs all by myself whil othe employees socilaized."
bad,"While working my 2+ years as a stock associate at GUESS, we have undergone about three changes in store management. The company has never kept a state team, especially in terms of store management. With so many associates and managers constantly changing, the store productivity has been heavily disrupted and many things become unorganized such as scheduling, sales, and positivity in the work environment."
bad,"My SM is wonderful, truthfully the only reason I came back to the company. Upper management is very unclear with directives and things are constantly flip flopping. I have been with the company for 3 1/2 Year’s and have only seen one raise and that’s when I was promoted. The company pushes you to meet an SPH but does not give your a raise if you constantly have the best numbers in the store. Would not recommend to a friend."
bad,Overall if it wasnt for the management teams coming together to help and support eachother the work place would have been even worst. I stay longer than expected cause of the people/staff. Made life long friendships. The understanding with HO when it came to the store front. Not allowed to have a life outside of work.
bad,"The district manager is rude, and they put tooo much stress on their  management forcing them to change the store around every other day , also you're paid little to nothing"
bad,"Managers are expected to motivate associates by pampering them with starbuck's and gift cards. Guess forces you to create in store contests with prizes weekly out of your own pocket. Write ups happen if someone steals on your segment. Had to deal with two part coverage in a top door store and was responsible for all roles ranging from being the manager to the security guard, dressing room attendant, sales associate, cashier. They have unrealistic expectations and are constantly blaming everything on budget cuts. Guess is also shutting down 400 stores and moving overseas. I do not recommend anyone working here it is a sinking ship and a very nasty environment. They also trick associates into thinking they are going to be promoted when they have no room to promote people. Lots of gossip and drama.  They laid me off the day before I was supposed to get my Vacation time. Constantly have  to explain why the business is suffering and how you can change it"
bad,"Teams on floor are easy to work with. Ensure that all agreements are in writing. Very corporate office environment, ensure you are on time or you will get talk or write up. Long hours required."
bad,"Job is very much inconsistent. Management changed twice in one year atleast. ""Retail"" environment at its finest. Management would pass on tasks to Associates and they would kill time in the back room. My experience was not the greatest. Company is great in regards to quality however the management was not."
bad,"Stressful, fast paced environment.  Modern day slavery for hotness and beauty.  Challenging, exciting, stressful, tough expectations, job never done!  Loved the people I worked with."
bad,Not that friendly to strict not enough friendly umm just not lit or talking environmental kustvstanding and looking not a lot friendly conversation ain much to say
bad,A typical day at work was very stressful in that the store was low on associates and managers. The employees had to work over time almost everyday and did not get paid or compensation for working over time. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers.
bad,"Great place to work if you have a passion for fashion, people and sales. My favorite part of my job was working with the staff. Developing them and watching them grow. While on the sales floor, my favorite part was working with our loyalty members who specifically came in looking for me."
bad,"Retail experience is good for anyone who is just starting out in the working world. Builds good character. Working at Guess, there were a lot of company discounts at every guess"
bad,"My day consisted of assisting customers on the floor, sorting out my area of sales. I learnt commmunication skills and customer service."
bad,"Great place to work during collage. Expect no free weekends, and lots of hard labor with great ability to sell and handle all of clients needs, desires, and problems."
bad,"The job is simple and mainly focused on customer service. You are given a daily goal when you show up to work, such as $500 in a 4 hour shift. This can be done by helping customers find the size they need, answering questions, or helping them put outfits together (this is done a lot at this store and can be really fun!). Because it is such a small store, you start to recognize customers and you will find that there are some that will feel more comfortable coming to you for help or only shopping while you are working. You get to really build a relationships with customers and if you are there long enough, you get to see babies growing up, which is a plus. This is all definitely the best part of this job--all the possible friendships!"
bad,"A livello umano penosi, la mia responsabile veniva in negozio facendo le improvvisate mettendomi a disagio dicendomi ""vedo ciò che fai "".. ansia a mille ogni giorno.. subiti  3 trasferimenti in soli 6 mesi e poi lasciata a casa dal giorno alla notte dicendomi "" da domani non lavori più qui"" mettendomi in FERIE OBBLIGATORIE due settimane prima della scadenza. . "
bad,Job is great for high school students or for people who don't need steady work hours
bad,i hated working here... they work you really hard and don't pay you nearly enough
bad,"Constant interaction with clients, ensuring daily sales goals were met and exceeded was imperative, preceding with status reports to senior management. I learned how to build both friendly as well as business relationships on a professional level, how to successfully resolve client issues, and how to exude confidence along with other techniques as a way to improve sales. The Guess by Marciano team was, as a group, creative and outgoing. The hardest part of this job was handling customer issues. What I enjoyed most about working with Guess by Marciano was leading my team and being able to express my creativity while doing what I know best, which is sales."
bad,"great job description but the management was very bad, salaries were not dispatched on time and my bank account was never opened for the time i worked there, and we were not allowed to sit"
bad,"Nicht zu empfehlen, druck von oben und es wird mehr geredet als getan. Angebliche Zukunftschancen um Mitarbeiter nicht zu verlieren."
bad,"lots of foreigners, mostly from china"
bad,Great job as a second job or part-time job for a student or retiree. As a full-time job its not going to pay the bills. Very cut throat when it comes to raises and advancement. I was a the top seller by a long shot and a department specialist for a few years but never made it further.
bad,It's a very fast paced environment when the store is full. You get lots of customers that need help. Requires you to be very attentive to the customers and just overall have great customer service.
bad,Alot of work based on sales targets. Poor management - don't care about personal problems or help in any way. Based on favourtism. Hard work required to be accepted by employees or management. Childish workplace hieracrchy. Enjoyable when working with friends and get use to the job. Gave a lot of hours which lowered the cons of management and allowed me to get by during shifts. Long hours so good if looking to make money.
bad,"- managers are underpaid compared to competitors"
bad,"Not the best job, if you’re new in retail. They rush you into working like a regular employee, with very little knowledge or training, which is a little unfair."
bad,Guess was my least favorite workplace. Managers gave us hours according to their preferences instead of our sales. We had very long shifts (ex: 12pm-11:30 pm) and sometimes we were only allowed 30 minute breaks.
bad,Es una tienda que tiene buena calidad pero pocas ventas.
bad,"I found the work place to be discriminating, the manager also tried to belittle me whilst I was there. Always this constant lack of respect and attitude towards me which I believe is very inappropriate as a manger to do so. Could not wait to finish every shift that I did due to the fact that it was just pure rudeness by the manager. The work colleagues were very nice and help full and make you feel included."
bad,"Very unprofessional management and environment, also didn't take the time out to properly train their staff as nothing was taught and then I was mocked for lack of product knowledge"
bad,"With declining sales, an increased workload is expected with minimal payroll. A typical day at work consisted of one on one selling with customers while trying to accomplish operational tasks designated from corporate office. Upper management was approachable with issues, however no changes would be made. In store culture has changed over the years with new management. There are fewer opportunities for advancement than when I first started with the company, mainly due to a lack of training & development (this can vary from manager to manager, unfortunately my store manager did not care to train or develop anyone on the team.) As a salaried manager I found myself consistently working more than 40 hours a week. I witnessed all of my co-workers have meltdowns at one point or another from being burnt out."
bad,Not a terrible place to work if you work in a fast pace environment where every customer buys. but since that's not attainable then yes its a bad place to work since only your sales seems to make you a great employee ! its not your managers its the head quaters in this case.
bad,"Un des travail que j'ai aimé le plus , mais avec beaucoup de pression et peu de reconnaissance"
bad,"Typical Work Day: Since I was working at a very high volume mall and about mid luxury line merchandise, my day was a lot of maintaining and replenishing the stock on the sales floor. Although most of my time was devoted to helping customers style themselves and have them walk away with product, and reaching my daily sales goal. "
bad,"They had high standards which are great, however they made company visits very stressful. The store always looked great and customer are number one!!! I learned a lot , just wish the upper management was more approachable."
bad,"If you cashier, you're pretty much there all day and if you're on the floor, you typically get moved around. Time goes by slow on the floor but more quickly on register. So many great people but honestly when it came to management, it was terrible. Very unfair and favoritism. Hardest part are the slow days and most enjoyable part is leaving for your shift."
bad,Drama left and right . Honestly a cool work environment but if you do work retail DO NOT trust anyone . I repeat DO NOT trust anyone . Good for a temporary job or for manager as well. Hours lacked because of location.
bad,"Guess is not the place for me. I am a hard worker & very eager to learn new things. Guess is not the place for me. I've never seen managers so uninterested in their employees & growing them. If you allow eagerness to learn, they shoot you down & ignore you."
bad,I enjoyed working here at the start but the longer I stayed the more I disliked it due to the attitude of peers and supervisors. There was a lack of authority made by the supervisors over everyone and this created biased opinions and roles of staff.
bad,There are several things about this company where they fail! there is no respect for the management team and you are expected to work up to 16 hours shifts and sometimes on next to no sleep as you've just left work. Theres no appreciation!!
bad,"Its a good job option for kids in high school or for young college students who needs the working experience and or money, and "
bad,"No comments, the place had wonderful coworkers but sometimes the managers could have been nicer, like i said in the summary, the managers could have done something else for the place to be lively"
bad,"Store manager doesn't train people, picks favorites, doesn't prioritize correctly, doesn't manage, no structure what so ever. "
bad,"i left because i wasn't getting enough hours. on top of that we had to wear the brand and the clothes were expensive even with your discount and with the amount of money i was getting paid, i was wasting more than what i was making."
bad,"The people that work at GUESS are amazing I never want us to work seperately, but the management is a little hard to get along with if you need your own time (as a full-time employee)."
bad,"it was a decent job, i liked picking and packing and working in a warehouse. I'd like to do something similar in the future."
bad,"Not a great experience . Although the salary was great, Tasks outweigh customer service. LP issues was another factor (Two people scheduled for a large store) I was there a few months and All management quit because the store was always a mess and totally unorganized due to tasking.  Pressure was too great and they lost good people. I have been in retail management for 20 years and never had such a horrible experience."
bad,"This company from my (albeit limited) perspective appeared in many areas to have a ""spaghetti-strategy"" -i.e. throw it against the wall and see what sticks. "
bad,"Un salaire qui mériterait d'être revu, ainsi que le gestion de la direction"
bad,Seasonal position.  There is room to grow but I was not given the opportunity to do so.  I really enjoyed working there and the schedule was flexible.
bad,i liked working here i started working with visuals and inventory which i liked
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of me finding out the goals for the day, figuring out what needs to be done to meet those goals. Making sure all aspects of the full customer experience were being provided. Successfully monitoring the entire store, staff, as well as customers. I played somewhat of a hostess, I always made sure I spoke to everyone. This ensured that my sense of urgency was always on 10."
bad,"A typical day at work involved reviewing ones daily, weekly, and monthly sales in order to properly reach sales goals for the month. Cleaning and maintaining the sales floor for a clean and upper class sales environment (dusting, folding, placing product based on store standard, cleaning windows/mirrors, sizing and spacing). I was trained for the denim specialist program which involved training staff of denim knowledge, working out monthly goals per day for a more realistic sales goal for staff and merchandising clothing. I was also familiarized with clientelling, placing product transfers, clothing replenishment, ""flips"" (placing new product on the sales floor) and creating window displays. I learned a great deal regarding loss prevention, top sellers, how to maintain consistent sales and the importance of motivation and time management. "
bad,My problem with Guess was that schedules would change and employees would not be warned. Another thing was that I would be scheduled on call but whenever I called in I would be told that I was not needed for the day.
bad,"Overall the company was an alright company to work for, until management changed. There are very strict rules there, and the employees that work there can cause a lot of drama. The discount for the merchandise was great comparably to other retail stores. During holidays the environment is a lot of fun with DJ events, and a lot of new trends and trendy up to date music is played. Fun for young, and highly optimistic people, but there are downfalls with sometimes the drama that goes along."
bad,"They had very poor management, not enough hours etc."
bad,Not a fan of most of the people I worked with including the manager. He was disrespectful and manipulative. Not a leader I would ever want to mirror. I was warned by a friend before taking that job and she was right. I was there for less than a year then I left.
bad,"•	Assisted customers with any help needed and supported managers to maximize customer service in stores."
bad,"I dreaded coming into work , management is all types of disorganized. I feel like they really need to be trained on how to respect their employees. Overall the fast paced nature of working in a Guess Factory store has taught me how to deal with being overwhelmed with customers and how to clean fast!"
bad,"Worst job I ever had, hardest part was keeping busy when it was slow, communication with management was terrible and everyday they would tell me to not come in because it was slow at one point I wasn't working for a month due to it being slow i talked to management several times nothing changed so I left."
bad,"Good place to work if your a student."
bad,"Long long hours, you work  until you have nothing left in you. Overall is a good company don't get me wrong, it gives you the opportunity to advance if you are a hard worker individual but your personal life will be severely affected"
bad,"Management walk on each other for career advancement, and expectations are not made clear between management and associates.  There is little time for training."
bad,"My typical day at work involves either opening or closing the store. Since I have been acting store manager for 6 months I would do all operational things. Visuals and merchandising, scheduling, managing sales reports, meeting sales goals both personal and store level. I have learned a lot about what it means to be a strong leader and how to set an example for others. I have also learned a lot about what I am looking for in a job. I enjoy an organized environment that values their people and helps to develop them into their full potential, I don't feel like I received this with Guess? The hardest part of my job at Guess is the hours. I have two young daughters and I don't want a job that requires me to work nights and every single weekend. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is interacting with people. I truly enjoy getting to meet new people. For the most part my co workers have been great, people are not always going to get along but learning to be tolerant and communication is key!"
bad,"GUESS is a large corporation that is very well known. I love the people I work with, but there is little growth available and  management could be improved. I've learned that one must be flexible, adaptable and reactionary in the fashion industry."
bad,At work it was probably the busiest of all times especially seasonal. Its fun with all the people but its a hot mess when they don't have enough people helping.
bad,"Nothing special, management knew less then I did i felt like"
bad,The store manager makes decisions that are based on feeling more than logic sometimes. She also gets really petty. She had me carry really baby shelf fixtures up a big ladder to put up without anyone handing it to me so I wouldn't have to climb up a ladder one handed.
bad,"It was a very interesting place. I met some great customers and 2 of my managers were awesome! Besides that, some of the workers would make fun ofour customers which I didn't enjoy."
bad,Environnement dynamique et beaucoup de changements de personnels
bad,Zaakvoerder gebruikt mensen voor een korte periode.
bad,it was okay. Employees was treated bad schedules comes out 6pm end of the week. The manager were completely careless for needs the employee and extreme favoritism
bad,"Achieving sales goals"
bad,being friendly and trying to meet a certain amount of money throughout the day. getting customers into the fitting rooms to help with their wardrobe and adding on to make a bigger sale.
bad,sales goal driven company. learned about running sales floor and influencing sales. small staff boutique setting that stresses customer interaction.
bad,"Display clothing."
bad,What i line the most was the enviroment so nice ande clan everybody well groomed
bad,"Helping customers find the best clothes."
bad,"On a typical busy day at work we have customers coming in and out nonstop,running around the store looking for merchandise. The management is always well prepared in running their shift. All my co-workers are amazing and good people. I'd say the hardest part of my job is always at the end,when we have to clean up the whole store but the most enjoyable part is when we open up and greet and help out the customers in whatever they need."
bad,"•	Provides prompt, courteous customer service"
bad,Guess is moving into a very superficial means of onboarding and its work environment. They are more focused on him/her's physical apearance than their ability to deliver results. It made me too uncomfortable after some time.
bad,Provided an opportunity to bond with coworkers and work as a team.
bad,"It was hard to make money here. You get hours based on your sales. But if you open, of course there are no customers so you won't sell anything therefore no hours."
bad,A day at work is exciting and some point but could be long at another point.The managent seems to abuse staf in the sens of our word dose not matter.
bad,"When I worked at Guess I was a sales associate. The managers were friendly and very easy to work with. A typical shift would consist of me counting the registers behind the managers to make sure there were no shortages, cleaning the store, assisting any customer that needed help, as well as making sales."
bad,wake up early.....be friendly to others...enjoyable parts are when thiers a party going on at hotel
good,"No room for growth"
good,"Its Alright, can't really build with this job.its really just a little side job for students looking for some pocket money. the management there are stuck up."
good,i was seasonal and the staff were catty and unfriendly. mandatory heels must be worn and was straining on the body. i learned about retail and was able to make use of the opportunity.
good,managers aren't really supportive. They never get your name right or remember your name. They forget to give you your 30 minute breaks.
good,"started as a seasonal job "
good,"A typical day of work consist of censor sweeping the store, checking if there is any items on hold for customers, making sure eveything is in it's correct place. Once customers start arriving you need to make sure everyone is greeted, you let them know your name, and figure out what they need help with. Management could be approved because there is a lack of leadership and guidence, everyone is out for their selves because comission benefits which is wrong. Hardest part of the job is being under paid when you provide excellent service and high sales for the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers, you meet so many type of people from different areas of illinois and in world."
good,Love some of the people there I miss them lots but the management  really didnt care about my requested day off (becuz of Doctor appointments mostly that were super important)
good,"Although there was room for growth in the company, the hourly wage was not sufficient for maintaining the ""look"" necessary to appeal to the company. The clothes were far too expensive and the discount was not the best."
good,"This was a fun job, but this specific location did not get much business therefore there was not usually anything to do except attatch security parts to clothes. I would definitely reccomend this job to anyone due to how quickly you can advance up. The workers there were snooty though."
good,"Honestly the company itself could be more amazing then what it is and that is great.If they actually cared more and recognized their managers/employees and really investigated poor managers it would thrive."
good,Hours were horrible and the stress was overwhelming. You have dedicated management but employees turnover is neverending. No life or family considered at this job
good,"Overall, I wouldn't recommend working at Guess. Although there are talented people at the company, they don't know how to retain their talent. Hours can be long, poor upper management, and high expectations for low pay compared to industry standards."
good,You are forced to work double shifts all the time becaus there is not enough staff. People at head office hire their friends to work in stores without experience and force store managers to promote the friends only after a week of employment.
good,"Management does not care for its employees work availability, sometimes they are rude and make you stay longer than usual, and some days I don't even have a break until an hour before I clock out for the day."
good,"C'est un job qui m'a permis de financer mes études et qui, dans tous les cas, n'offrait aucune perspective d'évolution et aucune gratification personnelle autre que le SMIC."
good,"I felt like i was working in a trap house, very unprofessional. My manager threatened me consistently. I did not feel safe to even go into my workplace."
good,When I arrive at Guess I would get a walkie-talkie and immediately begin to assist customers. I learned how to deal with different types of people. The management was basic and easygoing. My co-workers were fun to be around and they also were my piers. The hardest part of my job was dealing with some of the rude and impatient customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers get what they needed and seeing them excited about their clothing.
good,"I loved working for Guess. I loved interacting with customers, dressing up and going to work and having a good day. The scheduling with retail jobs is definitely the least enjoyable as time off is never okay. You work during the weekends late nights, which is not the greatest thing. There was not always compensation. I did not have benefits as a manager. My hours were not always guaranteed. With the economy and as a full time student this was not the greatest job to rely on. The best part was the recognition given to the employees whom worked very hard."
good,"A typical day at work consists of various tasks such as inventory control, setting sales goals, customer service, visual merchandising updates, staff development, and all the typical job responsibilites of retail management. With every working enviroment, there is always something to learn. At Guess? I have been learning a tramendous amount of Human Resource guidelines as well as how to handle traveling to various locations for the company. The hardest part of the job is juggling so many hats all while staying motivated to sell the items within the store. No matter how much each manager has on their plate, we have to ensure every customer walking through the door is given the same service and attention. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to meet new people. From everywhere from my customers to my staff, I am able to meet and learn a lot about various personalities. The best part is developing staff and being able to teach them what I know regarding retail and merchandising."
good,"Faire le ménage du magasin, accueillir les clients et les conseillers, performer pour atteindre les objectifs de ventes ect"
good,Great place to start working but would not not apply for long term employment. Will always find someone cheaper to take over your responsibilities and does not care about advancing you
good,the management over work their employees. employees work for over 10 hours every weekend. the managers leave everything up to the store manger and do not take responsibility for anything.
good,I was working at a busy store and there was multiple times were I feel like the pressure was on me and the other associates. The management needs to improve on communication and fairness.
good,"The location I worked at was constantly going between store managers and lacked respect. My last manager that made me wants to leave the company did not respect me and did not allow me to miss work because I had laryngitis. She told me to come in, while I could not speak, and clean the store and dust it."
good,"very busy and plotical company, every one back stabs each other on daily bases, no royalty at all to personal. just numbers, Parties are very enjoyable."
good,"This was my first ever job. In retrospect this experience taught me a lot about working with a team, customer service, cash handling, multi-tasling, and handling responsibility. Unfortunately, I had to leave due to poor management."
good,"you will get treated like a chile if you don't have enough sense and like being pushed around like a dog. "
good,"It is very clear that there is favoritism among the supervisors."
good,"I would help managers rearrange store. Assist customers with their purchases  and walk them through check out as well. I learned how to be extremely patient with others. My co workers were decent, some would do what they were suppose to and others would just walk around. The hardest part of the job was getting yelled at by customers that you were only trying to help."
good,"I would either be on the cash register or assisting customers pick out outfits for whatever occasion they needed. I learned how to be a team player, though there this job was very clicky and they did not match management together properly, all of them had their own techniques and it would confuse me from day to day, depending on the manager of what they expected out of me. The tough part about this job was you had to reach an unrealistic quota and if you did not reach it, they would not give hours. I loved changing the skumatics of the store and if another store opened, I would be able to help set it up."
good,"Help customers:"
good,"I've been working for this company for approximately four years. I have gained experience at three different Guess? Inc. stores.  Guess Accessories, Guess Factory, and Guess Retail. I have great customer service skills being that Guess Factory is a high volume store and we would see about 200 people an hour and a regular weekend day. I transferred to Guess retail to visual assistant position with no raise. I yet have to be promoted or given a raise. I've been open about moving up in the company but yet, four years later, i'm still waiting for that to happen. Now I am looking for a full-time or part-time assistant management position."
good,"Typical day at work involves folding clothing, cleaning, sorting and being a cashier. Not a very organized place of employment."
good,Not a good experience for me except for having a great manager. The business requirement can change anytime and they can fire you without giving you a notice. Worst experience with the company and no benefits as such!
good,No commission and low scheduling hours = low motivation from staff. Constant fighting amongst staff and management over professionalism and job satisfaction.
good,I worked at guess for a year got in as part time its not bad but they pay to little and they offer like no hours . A typical day would be going in for 5 hours like 2 days a week for 9 hr witch to me isn't worth it because mcdonalds offers more than that . I stayed her for a year only because i used it as a 2nd job but i quit do to the wage and hours and the fact that i really don't like dealing with people who are rude . This company also doesn't give you anything for making sales but they expect you to wanna makes sales when you receive nothing but a small wage and hours.
good,"Good place to work and benefits package.  Low hourly pay,  not enough staff in the building, low moral among staff on the work floor.  No raise in about 3 years."
good,"Guess is a company driven by fashion and trend. Because of that, I had fun seeing all the fashion and trend coming in every season. Seeing the company have fresh ideas was great to show to the customers. The company itself is great but the store that I worked for had very poor management. It was very hard to follow the team leads when there's poor communication between each other. I wish that the management did not have to cheat me of my pay because they said that they couldn't pay me my overtime work but would be able to pay me the next day instead to save them their payroll and not pay their employees their rightful hourly pay. Honestly, I wish the store management would have been more honest and put things right. But overall the team was easy to get along with and were all very friendly and fun to work with."
good,Working at Guess was a very fast pace job. I always working in the fitting room and had to keep track of all items as well as customers. Communication with the customers was always key
good,"advancement opportunity was great at the beginning. once new management took over, the culture decreased. hours were cut and unable to work with school hours."
good,Most managers do not recognize your hard work. Lots of favoritism. They are flexible with your school schedule. Good for a first job but nothing more.
good,"It was an honor to have been hired at one of the best known fashion brands in the world. I was treated unfairly by my immediate superior. My schedule would be to open the store at 6 or 7 am then leave for the remainder of the sales day and then scheduled again for the remaining closing hours. With all this, I would also be scheduled to help out other location store that were in a lower sales level but was still expected to maintain my sales generation at the same level of my home store. There was nobody I could reach out to due my store manager's personal relationship & friendship with the other managers and as a result I resigned after trying for a year."
good,"Guess is a tedious environment, with long hours, terrible breaks and goes against labour laws. I worked there for two years while in high school and stuck it out because it was retail. The discount is only 50% off once a month and the company seems to think to highly of themselves with little no innovation. Management was often disrespectful to not only staff but also customers. I though all retail would be the same but have had much better experiences elsewhere."
good,"I almost always enjoy going into work, I love our customers, the clothes and most importantly the people I work with. I think GUESS has great quality and I appreciate what they stand for. However, the company needs help in a lot of way. Guess fails to recognise good workers outside of what their SPH is (sales per hour). It is hard for someone like myself who is very visual more so than sales based. I prefer working as a team to achieve sales goals rather than an individual. Guess is not a well oiled machine in any which way. There is much more to a person than how much they sell in a day, week, month or year."
good,"A typical day is very fast paced, multitasking with clients and daily responsibilities of the up keep of the store. My co workers were more like family and we worked off each others sales to make our goal at the end of our shifts. Management was always organized when it came to logistics of the store."
good,"It was interesting working at Guess Accessories, I was lucky enough to work with great co workers. At the same time is was bittersweet because I was Seasonal.o"
good,i learned to be a leader in my department which is maintenance. Not everyone is your friend. You can only count on who ever is in your department. Hardest part of the job is trying to make management realize everything is time consuming and not every task could be done within a time frame they expect it to be. Overall its an ok place to work at.
good,I was responsible for all visual presentations within the shop.  There were very stringent timelines and we had to work at a very fast pace.  Some of the timelines expected were unrealistic.  My co-workers were all younger than myself and the company liked to align themselves to a very young demographic.  Overall the look that had to be maintained was very superficial.  I did enjoy the ability to express my creativity and cater certain aspects of the visual presentation to our client specifically to that location.  I loved planning new floorsets and seeing the new product coming in.  Guess is a well established brand and they would sponsor events that I loved being a part of.
good,"•	Greeted customers and guided them to required sections"
good,"I would really like not to provide a summary for the company i work for. However, it's a typical job in retail. It pays minimum wage and has no benefits for part time associates. Only managers work full time. The associates are pretty easy to get along with."
good,"Co-workers all have a great personality and the visual managers there. Great with your schedule and needs. Management is a little unfair, very rude and disrespectful to associates. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to do your own thing in the visual part. The hardest part about the job is come visual update days, you would work 1 in the morning. A typical day at work is going in to work, check your visuals, restock the floor, move any products or walls around with products that have sold through."
good,"A very busy environment, the customers are very needy, time passes by quickly. I learned how to multitask, and keep the area clean and still customer service."
good,"We were given a lot of pressure/stress to reach daily goal on sales as well as sign-ups for customers. If not, we'd be threatened with whoever had the least, they'd be sent home. Sometimes the managers and assistant managers would play favorites and you could easily tell when they were upset. We were given decent times for breaks, though."
good,The work place is competitive and very stressful when it comes to customers also management is corrupt they purposely give dedicated employees inconsistent hours
good,"working at guess wasnt the problem... the problem was the management team. they would be complete hypocrites about all rules given, as if they only applied to the associates and not themselves. they use you during the holidays to complete inventory and things they dont want to do themselves. they fired me and claimed it was because of my title as a ""holiday hire""... but i was the only one let go.  the management favors associates and will treat them better and give them more benefits, as well as leeway. the managers made the work environment uncomfortable, and with a bad taste.. i speak for the many whom STILL work there."
good,"This was a fun part-time job but had to quit because you were not allowed to switch shifts without District Manager approval which made no sense to me. I needed more flexibility since I had school. Also you cannot take more than 2 weeks off at a time, but managers let other managers bend this rule. While management was getting free clothes and shoes from the company, I was doing all of the cleaning (in-depth the whole store), stock replenishment, steaming clothes all alone while also running around helping customers to make sales all to be paid minimum wage. Managers stand at the computer while you run around doing everything yourself. You are asked for sales every hour even if no customers walked in and always feel like you should be selling more and pressuring customers to buy. Commission is impossible to get due to high sales goal, and the hours you work while opening and closing the store are counted in the calculation even though the store is closed and you cannot sell. Being paid at min wage and working only PT, I was expected to buy a new collection clothing item every 2 weeks just to wear at work (comes out to roughly $200-$300 a month to keep your job), and this was a new role when a new manager came in."
good,"I started this position while I was in university. I was a lead cashier. Within two weeks on the job, I was asked to start training new hires on cash. There are lots of protocols to address while on cash; addressing the customers in front of you and in your zone (front coverage), greeting customers 20 seconds upon entering, answering the phone, completing quick and efficient transactions, and ensuring cleanliness on cash and in zone. I learned that if you lead by example (others seeing what you do), that is a form of motivation. You learn to speak to both associates and customers (everything is a trial and error, no one is perfect on the first time around). Time management is extremely important to making the most of the business and the day. Following up with both staff and customers ensures productivity and loss prevention. The culture at work may be good, but the managers need to be consistent with professionalism and stop gossip before it spreads like wildfire and there is chaos in the workplace affecting the team and business. The hardest part of the job is recovery and cleaning at the end of the night when closes may take two to three hours. However the most enjoyable will be seeing new faces everyday (from customers) and helping them find what they are looking for. And secondly the work team that we have, people from all different backgrounds (age, culture/ethnicity, religions), getting to know one another and working together."
good,"I did not enjoy working at Guess because the managers were very inconsistent with hours, also there were no advancement opportunities. Also very short or no breaks, depending on company needs."
good,"stressful days, I learned to make sure you understand work life balance. The culture is a selling culture which I love. The hardest part of the job is having enough coverage"
good,"I loved working at guess at the time , we had a great staff and helped a lot of ohr clients . They would walk out of our store with a smile on their face because we made their birthday outfit or their baby shower outfit ."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral pero mal"
good,"As any other retail company, they expect you to push sales in a non-commission based salary. "
good,guess is a really fun place to work. although retail is not the greatest salary wise you have opportunities to work ample hours to make up for that. the dress code is very strict and i do not agree that female  employees should have to wear an uncomfortable amount of face makeup when working on the sales floor.
good,"Todo es muy bueno pero la paga y la administración de la empresa son pésimas. No tiene una coordinación real y siempre parece ""teléfono descompuesto""."
good,"If you speak multiple languages you'll excel exponentially, but if you don't you are at a disadvantage, but it is not impossible to grow. I am a timid person but I do enjoy helping others when help is wanted. My biggest obstacle is that the higher ups want us to go up to all customers and try to wedge our way into their shopping experience. For me, personally, I do not feel comfortable doing that which is why my sales are pretty low. I prefer keeping my workplace clean an organized so customers see a nice looking store to shop in, but since the main priority is making money the store can become very messy fast. This wouldn't be so bad if the closing staff didn't get hit with the brunt of it and end up staying at the store cleaning well after 1am. I enjoy this job to a degree but you do have to have a passion for customer service, fashion, and the company itself."
good,working at guess I was only seasonal but in that short time the stuff was fun and very welcoming I learned to make my customer service skills stronger.
good,"Greeting customer "
good,It was hard sometimes because you had to stay super late like 12 am to do mannequins and banners or wake up super early to do floorset. I didn't like that.
good,"La parte più bella del mio lavoro sono i miei colleghi. Credo che se un ambiente pubblico e dinamico come quello dove lavoro ha già una base armoniosa come questa allora il rapporto con i clienti, che è indubbiamente la cosa più difficile da creare, diventa automaticamente piacevole."
good,"fun environment , super rewarding."
good,"I would work sales and inventory."
good,"Overall, a typical day at work was fine. As a seasonal, it did get busy, but it wasn't anything that couldn't be handled. In regards to management, they were alright. It often felt like the management didn't care for the employees too much, but the management team seemed to do their best to keep the store flowing well and they were pretty competent with their positions."
good,"Guess is a good company, they have good management, and are very organized. However, sometimes they have unrealistic/unachievable expectations for their staff, their is little - no job security, and it is very hard to move up within the company."
good,"From Seasonal employee, to part time employee, to sales, to cashier/registers, to stock team, to employee of the month on 3 different occasions, and finally ending with the title of ""Manager-In-Training."""
good,Great place to begin in retail. Contains great coworkers. Place to meet new people. always something to do.
good,"pretty cool and fun, young people keep you on your toes. Co. is changing a lot of standards and maybe loosing its target customer"
good,its okay hours are long. They were not flexible with hours. The discount was decent.Pay wasn't great
good,just normal casual retail job.on call hours really sucked. wished we got commission pay
good,"- A typical day at work is busy for the most part and not a friendly environment."
good,Not very stressful. Can easily learn product and procedures. Pay is awful.
good,"An alright job, management was the drama. The stylist at the store was cool, but again management was the issue"
good,"i was working at guess as a part time job while i was studying , i was working as a sales person, i have learned how to be in contact with costumers and how to satisfy there needs"
good,This is a good place to work while in college... The best part about this job was the discount.... which was 40% off at all Guess stores.
good,When it comes to management that is when problems and failure to manage correct falls into place.Good start for new managers to gain experience in retail.
good,"Typical Retail Job, no room for growth and if there was room you would have to be at the company for 5+ years. Expected to work even if you have family emergencies. Also management kept promising me promotions but never followed through on promotions. The only good thing about the job was the $50 dollar incentive cards we got for making our month."
good,"My direct manager was awesome. Everyone else? Not so much. It’s a very paranoid environment, with people stabbing each other in the back to prove their worth. One of the founders is still involved in the company and is a total predator. There are some pretty insane unwritten rules, like, don’t be seen walking around with a coffee cup, and always walk with a purpose. People are always watching. There is also the insane practice of management waiting at the gates for people who are late. The hey are fired on sight."
good,"Nice place to work, staff was great most of the time.  Sadly i got stuck with a mediocre manager so sometimes it sucked.  Very competitive sales goals throughout each shift.  They expect very proper customer service but push a little too hard to be on the customers about promos and such."
good,"Stressful, competitive work place. No set management, didnt have a store manager when i started, and when i left there wasnt one. Not flexible or constant with hours."
good,"If you enjoy retail then you should be fine. Majority of the coworkers are cool people and most of the managers are cool, there are probably only two managers that aren't the best."
good,"o	Recruit, train, develop and coach a productive team"
good,"To sum it up, they didn't put in place the proper tools for training management. To make matters worse, I had a dictator of a district manager and when I went to HR to file a confidential complaint, I shortly received a three way call with HR and that diactrict manager to confront me on the complaint. Most Management for this company.. don't not conduct themselves in a professional manner."
good,"Guess is a popular brand with usually a high volume of customer traffic during peak hours, causing it to be a more stressful retail job. My typical day consisted of  our daily chat-in about our sales goals, helping customers, organizing the store, styling the fitting room doors, and watching out for potential theft. The management varied, where some managers were easier to work with and other managers weren't. Some managers simply watch over you to make sure you are doing okay while other managers tend to micromanage, making the job much more stressful to deal with. The hardest part of the job was closing shifts, where employees would have to close the store from 12am until about 1:30 - 3am, and occasionally we would have to work in heels when special guests would arrive. The workplace culture was okay. There were times when it would be stressful and demanding, but also times when it would be fun because sometimes Guess would throw parties and have a DJ come to play some music to promote sales that were going on. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely trying on clothes and dressing up customers."
good,I  enjoy working at guess except for t he fact that things are based on loyalty sign ups recently and if you don't sign up a certain amount  of people you get written up also that the schedule is based on sales
good,"While working at Guess I experienced first hand how to communicate with customers, while learning all the skill I needed to succeed in a fast paced environment. They give many hours even if you are part time"
good,"There was people who were more special than others. Lack of trust and lack of team effort. Very self centered team. No matter how hard someone works, you can never work for someone who doesn't appreciates and overlooks your abilities."
good,Guess has best benefits including one of the best health insurances . They pay 100% on a gym membership. They are all about wellness and staying healthy .they offer free accucpuncture and weight watchers . Iam very satisfied with their benefits .
good,"well they cut my hours frequently. i felt as if i was losing money, i did my best but felt unappreciated. The managers were full of themselves and cut my hrs i think i was the only person whos hrs they cut. i felt that they took advantage of my youth."
good,"This was a pretty relaxed environment to work in, the store is never really too busy so you can get bored. It is retail so the clients can be testy, but you learn to deal with it pretty quickly. You come in, listen to what the client needs for the occasion, dress them, and ring them up. Then clean up whatever articles they dont want and keep going. In stock, we keep everything organized and make sure there aren't pieces missing from stock or on the floor."
good,"I was hired with a maternity replacement contract, with the promise that if the business went well, I would be hired."
good,"I was employed for several years. Worked my behind off as the ONLY manager in the store. Never had days off, never was able to take time off. No help from outside help for a long while."
good,"Low wage compared to the tasks we were asked for. Always cut in the hours and very fixed on the sales goal. Managers used to always complain for things they never gave proper instructions and yet would never be satisfied. We would always stay 1,5 hour just for re-making every piles of clothes."
good,"Although fellow crew members were friendly and hard workers. managers had really bad attitudes, and were very unprofessional. Working environment was dangerous at times and lacked proper safety procedures. The workdays weren't terrible and the workload was very manageable. I got a pretty good amount of hours but the pay was low and lacked any real incentives to motivate workers."
good,A typical day in retail. Greeting and helping customers with products. Many opportunities to learn and improve my Spanish speaking skills. Goal oriented sales. Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with a wide range of customers.
good,A Guess é uma empresa que me possibilita aprender muito sobre atendimento a clientes e a área comercial. Meu gerente é uma pessoa dinâmica que está sempre disposto a ensinar.
good,"Stressful company, management would do a good job on the schedule. The only good thing was that we used to get 40% on clothes.They always give you the same shift and they are not fair with you."
good,"Worked there for a month before I quit. The company is great in terms of training you however the specific Guess I worked at had terrible staff and management, often rude and unwelcoming to new recruits of the business. Great job to focus in on your abilities to sell. The number of hours that a employee receives is based on the amount they sell in total devices by the hours (those who sell the most working the least amount of hours get the most shifts.) Although my experience with the Guess in South common  Edmonton was not the best, this does not hold true to other stores. When applying, go in store to observe the staff to get a grasp who you may be working for."
good,"guess est une entreprise de mode que je considère magnifique mais question de management il a un manque de communication, d'organisation, les managements en retard tout les matins, etc "
good,Overall my experience there was fine the company does lack a bit of direction. Overall all employees are friendly however most are not productive This job is perfect as a stepping stone into the work world.
good,With declining sales in retail it makes life a little tough with trying to hit and go above last years sales. Its not really any growth besides management if you have any desire to move beyond that its not happening.
good,Had awesome co-workers and became great friends with them. Great  learning experience for my first job. They had a cafeteria for breakfast and lunch which was a perk.
good,The people who work at guess are awesome.However the pay is very weak for the amount of work that is done.The employees are not treated fairly and is expected to work more than they are paid.
good,I started as an Intern and then was given full time opportunity. I got an opportunity to learn about PLM. Co-workers were good not all were friendly. Very serious environment.
good,Guess was my first retail job. It was a very friendly enviroment to work in and create new experiences. We often had events within the store which a celebrity would take part in. I learnt great customer service from guess.
good,"working with GUESS is fun but really tiring. After working at the back room , they will call you to help them fold hundred of t shirts , it's really tiring."
good,Working at Guess is a bit fun because it is a clothing line which is a big company name. I like working in Guess because most of my co-workers are all kind to me and not making me as a different person.
good,"Retail is where I obtained my first job and where I learned the basis of what it takes to work in a team environment. Working at Guess was unpleasant. Being the new one on the team was terrible I felt ostracized and and I was constantly being scrutinized for not going about things the way someone that has been there for years would've. They did not work as a team, there was always competition and constant badmouthing of one another. It was a really bad experience for me and I left as soon as I found another job."
good,The shifts you are set to work are either 4 or 5 hour shifts and they may send you home early if its slow. You may not be able to get a raise regardless how long you work there but you can request for one but not guaranteed.
good,"we work monday- saturday also holidays, co-workers are nice"
good,well the manager team are bad person that why I don't work no more over there
good,"The company is truly a wonderful company, however, the people that are in charge of the company have no idea how to make a business fundamentally sound. One of the most unprofessional places I have ever worked at, they do pay decent but it comes with a price and that price is stupidity and favoritism."
good,worked during the summer while in school and did not enjoy at all!
good,"-acquired a lot of interpersonal skills "
good,"Hours were short, management lied often and pay was minimal. They asked a lot of the employees and never gave anyone a raise. or such an upscale store they really under-appreciate their employees. They tried firing me by lying. I came in to work one afternoon and found I was no longer in the computer system. They had told me there was a mistake with corporate and that even though I was no longer in their system I could still work that day. I don't think so. I quit right there. Later I found that management had done the same to 8 other employees. That manager was no longer there after a few months."
good,At the time management was unwilling to work with difficult schedules. There was a high employee turnover rate. However this was a while ago and it could be different now.
good,"It was a great place to work for but I wasn't comfortable working in the environment. Within 6 months, I had about 6 managers. I didn't enjoy the stability that was brought to me."
good,Very busy weekends with little opportunity to rest. The productivity of the day depended very much on the customers and what needed or could be done in the store.
good,"guess est une entreprise d’apprentissage, de former les vendeurs à connaître le style des clients,et trouver éventuellement leurs besoins,à fin de les satisfaire dans leurs recherches de style vestimentaire ainsi qu’à leur besoins."
good,"Working for GUESS wasnt the worst work experience although not the best. "
good,"Depending on what you're looking for, this can either be an opportunity to grow, or another part-time job to have while you're in school. Very social, you must always be ready to talk to customers and respond to their needs to the best of your ability."
good,Co-workers were great and no problems between employees at least when I was there. Not a bad place. Good communication. Fun place to work. Not the best pay but at least have good hours.
good,"Guess does not put too much emphasis on their people, there were times we would put in extra hours, unfortunately some off the clock to get the store to standards. This was a few years back so I would hope as California laws changed this isn’t something that continues today."
good,Guess was not a bad place to work. Decent pay rate and co workers were cool. However management was very disappointing. Lots of drama in work in managers about other associates. Management would treat associates better than others based on if they liked you or not. They like you? 40+ hours. They dont like you? Maybe 12 hours a week if your lucky.
good,"Guess has a high pressure sales culture for minimum wage hourly pay. The expectations here are slightly high considering the lack of sales training is given. Fortunately, the clothes often sell themselves so it shouldn't be too difficult"
good,There were days when it was a very fast paced work environment but it was not unbearable. Enjoyable to work here for the most part. Leadership could be better.
good,I was no one seller yet new employees were coming in and getting paid a higher rate than I was. I felt there ethnicity plaid an important role when come to salary at guess!
good,"As a former sales associate, I would typically welcome many of our clienteles. Throughout the day it becomes a slower environment which made most days feel much longer."
good,commessa nel negozio di   abbigliamento uomo donna
good,Salario bajo y más responsabilidades de las debidas
good,"they do not give raises and not enough hours.In order to support your self you would need another job. although discount is decent, 40 percent off.. good luck!!"
good,Fast paced stressful job as my first retail job. Lack of communication between staff. Very busy time of the year called for much business but also a fast paced and stressful environment.
good,"none nothing really to say about guess. it was a good place to work and now I moved on from it. Didn't get enough hours, worked 2 days a week and that's all"
good,Guess was a comfortable place to work overall. The only unattractive reality about working at Guess were the spotted schedules. The inexperience in management can prove to be problematic for some.
good,"The music, the clothes, the day to day tasking is all fun. When you want to move up within the company, try to get a promotion, try to get a raise, do everything you possibly can in your power to do better you just can not. They make it impossible to do any of this, and on top of that they expect you to keep your sales up and they promote from within with only days of training. They would rather not deal with you."
good,"Une très bonne ambiance au sein de cette entreprise , seule gros point négatif la paie ..."
good,"Not my favorite place to work. I like how they push me to make sales which is difficult, but it makes me push myself and motivates me to do better, But I don't fell welcome by one of the four managers and my hours are being cut really bad."
good,They was never there when you needed something. When you did find them they would talk about how you need to in prove on things. They never would help you when needed.
good,Managers all over the place and have bad communication with each other; one manager will tell you one thing while another will tell you something else. Very unappreciative of employees. Have a tendency of messing up schedules or not have them ready when needed. Will schedule you on days that you have specified as not available. Managers have told us that we'll be paid time and a half for working on certain holidays and later will turn out to be false.
good,"Working retail isn't the easiest job. the actual work it involves is not difficult but rather the effort and time you put in makes days at work drag on. The people you work with make it a lot more enjoyable however the customers that come in make an absolute mess of the store. Management was questionable for me only because they did not fully train me until I was a month into working at the store. Overall it's not a bad job, its a good ""first-time"" job to build your experience"
good,"Avrebbero potuto creare più stimoli lavorativi."
good,Fun place to work in if you like and enjoy fashion. As a Guess employee you often take the role as a fashionista since customers look for your help to dress them up in the latest trends. A knowledge in fashion goes a long way in Guess.
good,"A typical day at work for me is usually going in at 2 pm to leave around 7 or 8 pm.  This is a very annoying schedule because it is in the middle of the day and very few hours to really compensate for losing a full day to those hours.  I have learned a great deal at this job, with customer service, time management, strong work ethic, multi-tasking, etc. The management we currently have is the best, we are a very close group.  The same with the co-workers every one is really nice and everyone helps each other out when needed.  The hardest part of the job is completing 60+ boxes with in 4 hours usually alone because we do not get enough hours to have 2 people working for shipment.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers, they are a great group of people and it makes work fun."
good,"High turnover, and management was not good.  Most enjoyable part is the visual merchandising and customers. Loved the discount."
good,"Guess has given me the ability to become a strong leader, fashion stylist, and manager. Typical day would be see what our numbers were for Last Year and do our best to make more than the previous year. GUESS challenges their employees to be the best at selling by giving personal goals each day, you must exceed that goal. Co workers can be supportive, depending on the team.I have gained a clientele from working with GUESS, and better knowledge of all things operations."
good,"Guess gives positive re-enforcement through 5 minute coaching, role -play and monetary prizes. The atmosphere is very fun. Employees go out together and try to include everyone in fun activities. Lots of events. Job security and opportunities to grow are not there. If you don't make the numbers, your job is on the line. Managers don't get paid much"
good,"Cashier, Sales Associate, Expected to have Product Knowledge outside of work, unpaid. Hours are base on sales, if someone did not walk into the store, that meant you were scheduled less hours or days with less traffic."
good,"A typical day at work would be slow because business was slow. I learned a lot about retail and marketing management. Management was fair, but was very short giving on hours for the staff. The hardest part of the job was not working enough throughout the week. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and assisting them in choosing outfits and accessories."
good,"job duties:"
good,"A typical work day at Guess was to help customers find the outfit that best suited their needs. By using the knowledge of which products were most popular and in season, the customers left happy and also became returning customers. "
good,"depending on the store or location your experience may be different."
good,Guess gave me great practice with styling both men and women of all different shapes and sizes. It was a very fun learning different sides of retail.
good,Structured routine. Great team. Able to assist customers fulfill their needs. Management is approachable. Great location for customers. It is difficult to obtain necessary hours due to the economy. Therefore unable to justify expense of public transportation.
good,"At first I did not mind working at Guess, until management change. Too much expectation for just a short period of time. On a busy day it would be fine because I had no reason to be bored and time flew by, on a day where I would see a few customers, which was mostly during the week, I found myself bored a lot all there was to do was stand there and fold clothes that needed to be folded which was minimal because of the low traffic in the store. I learned how to communicate better with people and I also learned needed Spanish while working there, although I know very little, it still made customers happy to see me talk they're language I understand it way better."
good,"manageable tasks, prioritizing is a must."
good,This company was easy to grow in. I loved coming to work every day. However it was difficult to balance my personal life with my work life. I was always getting calls or texts from management both at home and at work constantly.
good,Its not a good work environment. The quality of the clothes are a okay reasonable price
good,"The workplace can be enjoyable depending on management, they force the employees to wear short outfits and heels at all time. Its very uncomfortable going to work and not being able to move around due to your outfit. I have left work many times in pain from not being able to change my heels, if I don't wear a dress on certain days ill get written up for dress code. In my experience at Guess Accessories I was not valued as an employee."
good,"This company is hard to advance with. I loved my coworkers, even though not everyone was on the same page. Management was good. Thy didnt belittle you or anything of the sort. I would go back."
good,"Giornata del Visual: mi occupo dell'allestimento di tre windows (1 web e 2 libere), creo gli outfit (n°14) e posiziono i manichini in vetrina."
good,"I like working there. the people are nice and the work isn't that hard. However, it's impossible to make a living off of the pay there. It's great if you're in school or as a second job on the side."
good,"This job was pretty awesome. As an employee at Guess Inc. in the Lighthouse Place Outlet Mall it gave the benefit of receiving a discount not only at their store but at every other store out there too. The basic duties of working there consisted of everything. The employee would be the cashier, stock person, cleaner, sales associate, help customers find the right clothes, and keep the store clean. The hardest part of this job was trying to remember all the discounts going on."
good,"I learned to deal with different personality types, to always keep calm in situations of misunderstanding. "
good,"en este trabajo , de promotora ordenas los stand de carteras y accesorios que están en el mostrador cada una de ella tiene su billeteras. y con un lugar iluminado para que tengan la mejor visualización. aprendí hacer guías de despacho,tanto de ir como a dejar a la misma tienda"
good,"Truly difficult to move up in a company; furthermore, I've seen promotions move slowly for even those who have a very strong tenure. Because of the quantitative hiring in the store, there is such a huge turnover rate within the store that it causes a loss of morale within amongst the staff. There becomes the development of mentality that you are just another pair of hands and legs within the store. The benefits are great but not for those who live in Hawai'i; Blue Cross Blue Shield is very difficult to use in a state that mainly uses Kaiser or HMSA even though HMSA and BCBS are connected. I just remember that over-night shifts were terrible since the air conditioning in the mall ended at 11pm. Basically, I was overworked and underpaid."
good,"Great company to work for when beginning your career, oppurtunities are what you make of them for yourself. This company is fast paced and many long hours to achieve success. Training is on hands and learned as you go. Recommended for a young acheiever that doesn't have children yet. Owner is passionate and great person."
good,"learning how to give a good customer service, and provide my customers what they want and need"
good,It was my first name brand job and it was ok for the first week but after that I didn't understand the work ethic first I was told to be thorough with my station but then I was told to skip steps some people would just go to the bathroom every so often to avoid work.
good,Great place to work at for the first few weeks. You end up getting busy out of nowhere. Communication is NOT there. People are always trying to save their own positions and blame others for something that went wrong. They have a nice and clean campus but the environment made me question if I wanted to continue to work there. It’s not a union company so they can fire anyone they want at anytime. Sometimes you . They have amazing benefits and they try to get employees involved. The fear if you are safe at your position. People act like kids in different situations
good,"Working at Guess was interesting because of the customer interactions, but regardless of that it was a retail experience. The compensation definitely could have been increased do to the amount of work/hours of each shift."
good,"Very competitive environment, must have an aggressive sales personality in order to work here, or they won't keep you. Must keep a high sales per hour $ or else they will not give you hours or keep you."
good,I found it quite difficult to manage the cleanness of my work site when I had a continuous line or groups of people coming in. Time management and communication become huge keys when going about your day here at guess.
good,You will definitely learn a lot information while working here. Since it is Retail everyday is different and a fun environment to work in. Management has flexible scheduling.
good,"Would have to be at the store by 5 am some days, very fast-paced, always something to do. Coworkers were very fun to be around and made the day enjoyable."
good,"helping customers"
good,This job was out of hands. The managers didn’t like working with me. After the first week they were all surprised that I was still working there. I did my job how they taught me and did my hours right. It was a seasonal job but I learned how to work during the Christmas season.
good,"The only negative thing about working at Guess was that the salary was not that great. Although sale associates typically get paid minimum wage, it simple is not enough. Aside from that the environment was positive, team driven, and busy"
good,The management is overworked and underpaid. Everyone is required to do be able to do each others jobs there is no division between management roles. Would not recommend
good,"sales associate "
good,"Positivo:"
good,"Guess was a quality company. Working in their factory outlet stores was a very competitive culture. Guess was a global name brand, which required a global approach in all aspects of the retail world."
good,"A typical day at Guess Factory would be customer service centered, keeping all customers happy and taken care of. One of the members or more is usually on register duty. We all share the job of keeping the store presentable for customers, whether its taking care of shipment, cleaning the floors and counters or setting up displays."
good,Overall it is a good job to have on the side and or for high school students. However there is no salary raises or any opportunities for advancements in this work place
good,"Guess had a friendly team and co workers as well as the managers, but the pay wasn't fair enough compared to the work that was being done. Good thing was the discounts that were provided."
good,"Guess was fun place to work at the time, I enjoy the customers. My associate was welling to learn and enjoy work at Guess as well, which made the it a good place to work."
good,3 Brothers owned the company and each had their own departments.  They would fight among themselves and would rarely agree with each other so employees were put in between them.
good,It's a nice job for a college student or someone's first job. I truly enjoy the flexible work schedule so I am able to work and worry about my school work. I am also able to travel and see family while working at this establishment.
good,Bacana de se trabalhar. Sempre novas tarefas a se cumprir.
good,"Guess is a fun workplace to work if someone is looking for an opportunity to learn about fashion or first time job."
good,"GUESS has a fun and upbeat environment for both employees and customers. On slow days, there isn't much to do for a cashier since there aren't many customers shopping. Busy days are more fun because it enables you to work faster and get through the line up before the hour ends. There are many types of customers who shop at GUESS and many are regulars and visitors from out of town. I learned the value of great customer service by working here. We always welcome the customers with a smile and make their shopping experience worth while. The management is great, they understand our needs as employees and fulfill them when needed. The benefits would be the discount on merchandise. The hardest part of this job is dealing with upset customers which doesn't happen that often and the most enjoyable part would be getting to look your best for work and listen to great music while working. Also, meeting new people as they walk through the doors."
good,"Selling GUESS clothing and products, must hit sales quotas, high quality customer service, folding clothes, cleaning store, after hours stock and display adjustments"
good,"A typical day at Guess? Philippines is very productive as we start our work at 8am and ends at 6:30pm. It is a competitive workplace wherein you need to have this sense of urgency in managing your time and accomplishing tasks. You need to be more responsible in monitoring the calendar every season and track the pre-production process of the samples. Having a sharp memory is a must as you need to remember a lot of things in order to avoid missing a task. You need to be organize on everything, from your files up to the sample products. And you must be detail oriented."
good,Is great giving the position to every young person seaking for a new job. Comfortable place to work. There are lots of training to start moving forward and have all the skills on selling and costumer service.
good,Grateful for the opportunity but the lack of organization and insensibility towards others from the managers made it really hard to enjoy the work and appreciate the oportunity.
good,"A typical day at Guess is almost always stress free."
good,Learned a lot about retail and sales. Was only a temporary seasonal job with less than part time hours as my first job. Did well in sales but not my ideal place to work in the long run.
good,"bonne expérience, zoning afin de tenir le magasin propres, bon responsable qui aimait son équipe"
good,to travel from home to company...all the procedure of be i stockman the management are ok  to employee..co workers are good to travel with out service ..my work as in stockman
good,"What I liked about working here, was the atmosphere with the employees, as well as customers. Althrough we had basic procedures on how to commit and complete a sale, working as a team was by far enjoyable."
good,I'm am over going I'm am an over achiever and go above and beyond to make my customer happy. I like to change myself to conquer my goals for the day or for any period in time. A typical day at work consists of selling my product and having a set goal of money and merchandise to sell. Welcoming customers in and telling them thank you for shopping when leaving. The co workers there are really enjoyable but the hardest part of the job is knowing if your sale is really given to you when you cannot ring your customer out. The most enjoyable part of it is knowing you have satisfied your customer on what he or she wants.
good,"I love working in Guess but the thing is I don't want to work with the other staff because of  a lazyness."
good,"It is fun if you like to help customers and style them from head to toe. They are very flexible with scheduling, which is great for any college student. But they are mandatory once of twice a year for the holiday season."
good,"Working at guess is a perk in itself. There are a lot of people to meet, things to do, and most importantly work to be done. You are on your feet but the customers are very friendly and you will never have a dull moment."
good,to ensure that all the products are all organized and all the costumers are assisting very well with their suggestion and complaint
good,"ik heb vanaf toen tot heden veel geleerd over het bedrijf. Waar het voor staat, hoe je klanten het beste kan benaderen, hoe je jezelf het beste kan motiveren en producten op een leuke manier kunt verkopen."
good,"- In una tipica giornata di lavoro (su turni - no orari fissi), si procede costantemente all'organizzazione impeccabile degli espositori ed alla rifornitura degli stessi con capi in ordine di taglia e colore (l'aspetto estetico del negozio è una priorità) e ci si tiene costantemente aggiornati sulle iniziative di vendita provenienti dalla sede principale; quando il cliente fa il suo ingresso nello store va tassativamente accolto con cortesia e messo a suo agio e l'addetto alla vendita deve intuire immediatamente il prodotto da sottoporre e procede a seguire il suo cliente rispondendo alle sue esigenze, mantenendo, nel contempo, lo store sotto controllo."
good,"This was a mall job and like all mall jobs, it wasn't too fun and the pay was not enough for the amount of sales i made for the retail store."
good,"This was my first job career,which i came across the human lifestyle n what a retail job is. but it makes me more challenge in my future career which i can see open my eyes, What is a Hard work!"
good,"GUESS has a  fun upbeat atmosphere to work in."
good,Typical retail job. employee discount was nice but job was awful. too demanding and customers where usually snotty. I did not enjoy working here.
good,"The opener was in charge of cleaning and organizing the store before the store opened so the store looked nice and neat for the costumers. I learned a lot about managing a retail store, how to do returns, exchanges, handle costumers, the appropriate way to approach costumers when they need assistance. My co-workers were all very friendly and I got along with all of them. I enjoyed working at Guess because we all worked as a team to make our daily goals possible."
good,"good working enviroment"
good,"A typical day at work is just like any other retail store, you do have to be extremely competitive in order to reach your sales quotas which can get frustrating."
good,On a typical day at work I sale on average $600 worth of merchandise for 4 hours of work. Management has a very positive attitude about the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with  customers.
good,Overall experience at Guess was good up until the point of a change in management. The new GM at the time felt she had a point to prove.
good,"Fun place to work, however, they can do better on compensation. Great incentive is the brand employee discount. Perfect job for a student."
good,Nice environment. Customers were nice But not stable enough for a full time job.
good,"Everyday I have to work 10 hours and have a day off every week. Daily you will meet different types of customers whom you will get to interact with. I learned how to speak different dialects as a need to a multicultural environment. I learned how to market a product and the different kind of management techniques in handling a store room, the staff and reaching the targets. My co workers are fun to be with as in the longest run, we became a family. The most enjoyable part is the times you get to meet different kind of people and get to learn about their culture and not to mention their different type of taste when in terms of clothing. It is always nice when you have regular customers who will always look for you. It's fulfilling."
good,"Guess is a interesting place to work, really good benefits."
good,"Much of my customer service skills have come from Guess. They are a decent company to work for, but there is little employee appreciation or hope to move up within the company."
good,It's a good company to work for and helps you build customer service skills
good,"I honestly loved this job. All the people are great. Since it is a high end store though, you do get a lot of people who seem very ""stuck up""."
good,There's no support from upper management for promotions. The pay is lower compared to other companies. No annual raises even if you get a good review.
good,Working for guess in the beginning was very fun. I enjoyed going to work and doing my job. after a couple of years of working with guess i asked for a raise. the company would not approve my raise so that in turn forced me to leave the company.
good,"opening shift usually clean up , restock the floor , make sure the register has all of the proper equipment, speak to the manager about the goal for the day."
good,"Es algo bonito, otro tipo de cultura y siempre agradecidos"
good,"this job was great to gain costumers service experience, it was fun dressing up for work and helping others with fashion trends . the hardest part of the job is the late nights"
good,Le milieu de travail de la vente au détail est quelque peu stressant. Il faut que les employés atteignent des résultats parfois utopiques.
good,"It wasn't always as busy as expected, but the caliber of candidates were held in high regard, whereas the pay was not commensurate to the expectation of the associates.  Discounts were given in limitless quantities, and certainly there was an expectation to embody the brand."
good,Es una empresa con mucho ritmo y un constante trabajo bajo presión.
good,Not bad but not good either. I did not liked the cleaning floors and windows but I loved learning dealing with customers and cashiering which I appreciate a lot.
good,"When I started the Management team was strong but after changes made by the head office to move managers around the business got effected, poor choice. "
good,"I have had a handful of jobs in my lifetime and this is not my favorite. The management was awful and left me in the dust when they found out i was pregnant. So much so that i did not even make 400 Hours to qualify for maternity leave in the 11 months i worked there, in which i was supposed to be training to be a full time assistant manager. "
good,"Slow business "
good,Regional and Loss Prevention managers are very critical at times and not realistic as to goals and expectations. At many times they do not feel like a support system but rather looking to find errors. A great deal of focus on the negative and minimal focus on positive.
good,"I enjoyed working at GUESS as it allowed me to work around my school schedule, and relevant to my intrest in fashion. the typical day consisted of help costumers buy clothes and making sure the store was clean and organized."
good,La possibilité de rencontrer beaucoup de personne et d’apprendre davantage
good,"I gained a lot of technical skills during my time here. However, they do not like to promote from within unless you’ve stuck around for at least a decade. And whiles you wait, there are no raises. Good for a couple of years, bad for the long haul."
good,"sehr langweilig, viel zu hohe Erwartungen, keiner hilft keinem"
good,"While working for GUESS I experienced a few of unprofessional managers, I had worked there for 3 years and was always told they didn't do raises but people with no experience were being hired in at a higher pay. I was asked by the store manager at one point to get the store keys from another manager, which is very unprofessional considering I was only an employee."
good,Don't receive raises every year.  Working a lot of weekends starting pay is not that good other warehouses start out with more. Over worked and under paid there are people who's works there for over 14 years and are make what other warehouses are starting out with. Due to not giving out raises yearly.
good,"Ambiente Lavorativo stimolante e flessibile."
good,i enjoyed the discount policy. the hardest part of the job was meeting your sales quote and feeling like your job was on the line if people didn't buy something.
good,"it is a very busy store, manager were excellent but the hours were very limited. flexibility was not great specially for students. the payment was not so good."
good,"Everyone is replaceable, everyone is in survival mode. Pay is minimal compared to the work they require of you. They throw fun parties - good network opportunities."
good,"learned a lot being that this was my first retail position in a very busy mall. I learned to work fast and efficient in helping customers have a great shopping experience. Pushing sales, offering store promotions and maintaining a well mannered work ethic."
good,"Store is ran like it's your own business. You have to be able to read reports, strategize, hire/train and overall take risks to maximize on COMPs. The company does expect a lot from you to know product specifics, categories, and where your store stands to LY, on the week, month, quarter and year."
good,"I worked the weekend shift as a 2nd job to get ahead. There are some perks like xmas gift, derby gift, newborn baby gift, massages, health screenings ect. But 12.50 an hour i could never live on."
good,"An okay company to work for. Retail is retail. Management was good. Environment was okay. Customers were decent. Culture was fun. Terrible hours, no life."
good,"Guess is an American clothing brand and retailer. In addition to clothing for both men and women, Guess markets other fashion accessories such as watches, jewelry, perfumes, and shoes."
good,"Guess is a great place to work. They give you many opportunities to train and improve your work life. They're very understanding with work/life balance and scheduling.  The benefits, discounts and incentives make you feel appreciated as an employee. Hours were cut a lot which made my position a lot harder since I was called to be on the sales floor more then in the stock room where I was needed. Your teammates can make your time there very difficult and uncomfortable, which is what lead me to leave the company. I enjoyed my short time at the company, but a few team members along with the lack of enough hours made work a lot more difficult for me especially with the position i was hired for."
good,A typical day at work would be always having something to do. I learned how to use their cash register system and management was very uplifting. The hardest part about the job was dealing with people who sought to steal but security kept their eyes out for those few persons.
good,"Guess had a great corporate environment where we felt being a part from. The company was not hiring at the time and , if given the opportunity, I would have stayed there."
good,"Good for new graduates or part time students "
good,"- good discount "
good,"The job is nothing special, the discounts on clothes and jewelry are okay but everything else is pretty basic. if your managers are nice its a chill environment and if you work a lot of hour you can almost make a half decent check."
good,difícil promoción aunque hagas tareas del puesto superior
good,This place was fun to work at. Scheduling isn't that great. Shifts were always 4 hours. A lot of favoritism going on here. All girls so very competitive environment. But overall good.
good,"I love the fast paced environment, and the fact that I was continuously challenged in different area of the company to succeed.  However, there is minimal room for growth, and the level of expectation for store managers can be unrealistic.  There is also not many opportunities beyond becoming a store manager - positions at the corporate level are very limited.  This company taught me how to lead a team (of staff and managers) with different personalities, multi-task (by delegating to appropriate employees, and following up on execution), time management, and build an overall positive work environment that my staff wanted to be a part of."
good,"Ouverture des caisses"
good,"The photo studio was great! Worked with many creative individuals, management in my department was amazing, other departments not so much. There was no room for growth in company, there was a lack in communication in many areas."
good,Trend focused sales staff. Increased sales per hour with staff and focused on identifying talent within staff.  Trained associates and assistant managers
good,Guess allowed me to get one on one time with customers and allowed me to improve my customer relations. Guess was my before the military so it helped prepared me in every way
good,it is a good place to work if you are a college or high school kid. I would not recomend this as a career. They do not work on commission which is very odd.
good,The job is a very typical type of retail job. There were many roles as a sales associate that had to be performed. Merchandise inventory was a big deal. Learning the systems was not that difficult.
good,Guess has great brand heritage. It is a shame they are joining many other retailers that are struggling in the competitive environment and closing stores.
good,"Simple job, with great people. Room for career growth. and they are willing to work with any schedule. management is understanding. but the customers can be difficult."
good,"A typical day at work was attending clients, arrange the clothes in the store. I learned customer service, and how to work in teams. The hardest part of the job was to arrange all of the clothes at the end of the shift. The most enjoyable was to be at the register"
good,GUESS gives lots of learn opportunities and is greatly connected through out stores as close working environment. Its a very positive environment to be in and lots of interacting between client and associates
good,"too focused on selling"
good,"I personally worked under amazing top leadership, however the company was shifting as I left and the new CEO's vision and communication left much to be desired."
good,"not great for saving money , good discounts and good for learning more about the fundamentals of retail. Good for someone looking to climb the ladder."
good,"Working here was great for a retail job.  Everyone worked well together. Management did their best to be fair in scheduling, but natural fluctuations in schedule due to the nature of retail environment existed."
good,"I did not really enjoy working here, we would do too much work for little pay. They were not flexible with my school at the time. They do favorite people."
good,"Fast paced environment filled with selling goals and learning to work with people , as well as helping people get the best shopping experience possible."
good,"My last manager was very motivating in having all of her employees sell, sell, and sell. She was also very sweet and made the job enjoyable. The people working there were also very interested in fashion, obviously."
good,"Great place to work in, people help out in the best way they can, the hours were great as well as long as you get your sales in since its competitive."
good,I currently work at guess right now and the most I can say is that it's okay. I enjoy handling apparel as well as engaging with the customers. Also the discount is deff a huge plus since mostly everything in there is super expensive. But as many jobs in the world there are some downfalls such as the hours. I usually work 5 or 10 hours a week at the most which kinda sucks.. also it's a lot of standing with only a 15 minute break.
good,"my boss built a great team, that worked extremely well together. we provided great balance, as well as skill building that allowed us to be successful in many areas."
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo y buenos horarios.formacion a cargo de la empresa
good,"Worked here for about a year, fun experience as it was my first retail job. Location was great, discount was great however pay was extremely low although we worked off of commission. Overall the experience was nice if you're young and looking for a start out job."
good,Guess is a fun place to work at. The people there are friendly and it's a great job for those who want to gain retail experiences. My time there was a great experiences.
good,"Overall Guess was a great company to work with, you meet a lot of amazing people. Depending on what store location you work at theres a lot of pressure from corporate offices and it sinks the energy out of you trying to impress them. My role as a manager caused me to have lots of things to handle and often times I don't feel I didn't get compensated enough for what I did and how much time and effort I put into that place. You may like it there as just a sales associate, definitely way less pressure on your hands."
good,Did not get to work with Guess reps. since it was mainly held in Carsons. Was mainly working by myself which was not that fun and did not get to learn to work as a team through this.
good,Great job for a couple of months but during the time if your not anybody friend it can kinda messy. I did enjoy working here for a year but now I think it's time for a change
good,"This job would be much better with commissions. Management changed way too often and the amount of work done did not compare to the pay grade. "
good,"I was hired as a cashier, I moved up to assistant manager with in a month or two as a temp. great team of employees, co manager brought lots of drama and problems to the store, which in the end lead to the termination and re hire of store manager, who in the end brought her own employees with her. for me the best part was staging outfits and helping customers look and feel great when they leave our store,"
good,"it was a good experience working at Guess Inc. However, the pay could have been better compare to the work load.**************************************"
good,Business isn't great for any big retailers and GUESS is no different. Lay offs and high stress environment. Highly competitive culture with not much room for advancement.
good,"I get more experience in quality control women’s and men’s garments –jeans, winter jackets, jackets, pants, dresses, blouses, increase my productivity."
good,Felt unappreciated and very little opportunity to move up in the company. Gave the run around when asked for a raise. Overall wouldn't recommend working for company.
good,"It is a fun place to work, a typical work day would begin with counting the money, making sure there were no sensors, cleaning the floors, and washing windows. After those task were finished we would open the store to let customers shop. After, work it was cleaning. Folding clothes, checking closets, sensor sweeping, sweeping, and counting money."
good,"A) this might not apply to all locations but management communication is definitely an area of opportunity"
good,"Super high energy! You almost have to be and sometimes they force you to be. If you're having a bad day, you are not allowed to show it whatsoever while on the clock. I didn't like that part. Some managers  are really childish because the store is all girls. I liked the fast paced and dress code of the store though."
good,"When i came to the company I was sold on the idea of advancement in the workplace but when it came time to be promoted the position was taken away. There is constant change in management. Raises are rarely given, but its a fun place to work if you love fashion. The company is constantly evolving and there is always something new to learn."
good,"While the staff and managwment are very friendly and geeat co-workers the company itself is quite underwhelming. Little to no payment, unresonable with work shifts and pay, and barely any room for advancements."
good,"Not a high staff overturn, but a lot of letting go of staff. Higher management would rather skimp on hours and let a few people be stressed than to provide adequate hours for the store to function properly."
good,"The atmosphere at Guess has gradually become more negative over the last year.  While there is definitely opportunities for growth and advancement, it is at a steep price.  Once in management, your life is Guess. I hadn't been able to take more than a week's vacation in 3 years.  While you work there, be prepared for no recognition of successes, but expect it for anything negative."
good,Had to work with many people and make customers in store experience great and have great customer service skills. Check customers out and make sure they have everything they need.
good,Shifts were hard to come by. Management was unclear at times about the goals they expected us to achieve. Exciting work environment. Interact with many new faces everyday.
good,"not alot of room for advancement, good college job and pay is ok. 8.55 and hour not to bad. they higher anyone no matter how bad they do in interview."
good,"Travailler au guess m'a permis de développer un bel esprit d'équipe avec mes collègues de travail. Ainsi , travailler au guess m'a permis d'augmenter mes expériences de vendeuses et de caissières.Normalement , nous faisons nos journées.Par conséquent, lorsque ce n'était pas le cas , cela diminuais nos heures."
good,"I find the best part of my job is the great people I work with, if they weren't there I probably would not have chosen to stay. The management team sometimes struggles."
good,Hard work is key . Management was horrible. co workers were cool. the hardest part was having to be at for at 5 in the morning. the most enjoyable part was the customers.
good,"Nice outgoing work environment. Workers create a very positive place for customers, and workers. Management was very helpful. Enjoyed helping and meeting new people."
good,"ive learned alot by working at guess. it includes my skills in providing excellent customer servive and care, stocking in the back room , serving customers at the cash register and choosing for them the right styles and sizes. talking about the management it was good in the begining but now its just poor."
good,"Guess is a good brand to work for; usually the products sell themselves, especially the jeans. The management is very understanding and flexible in hours (willing to work around your schedule). But, there is barely any room to grow in the company because they'd rather hire outside of the company rather than promote someone within the company. Also, you have to beg them for a raise; even if you've been working there for 1 year + and a good associate. They aren't eager to motivate their employees at all; all they want to do is cut costs."
good,"one of my favourite parts about working for guess was that there was something that always needed to get done, so you were always busy.  while working at guess i developed my social skills i also learned how  to work individually and as part of a team."
good,"The managers were very unprofessional - there were a lot of examples with many of the employees where personal life would get involved with our work life which in my opinion is highly unprofessional. I did learn a lot though, and I enjoyed the brand as a whole and the people that I worked with for the most part."
good,Days are usually fast of there is customers to help. Because this location has a lot of Hispanic you can practically learn Spanish which is a plus.
good,I worked for Guess for many years and did not see the lay-off coming.The annual increases were very low..I will say they did not leave me hanging. Gave me a decent not excellent severance package to help allow the stress and time to look for another job.
good,"easy to balance life and school, management wasn't always fair to employees, co workers were friendly and easy to maintain relationships with"
good,Typical Day At Was Breeze And Easy But Didn't Pay My Last Check I Learned More About Fake Money And Being Kind To Others The Management Was Great But I Was Only Seasonal
good,"It was alright, always busy but was fun to work with new people and help customers. Was given a lot of responsibilities but managed to work through them thoroughly."
good,Esperienza che mi ha dato tanto.Mi ha permesso di avere rapporti con tante persone essendo una grande azienda. Nei negozi in cui ho lavorato staff sempre molto affiatati.
good,Kind a slow sales because not everyday they will buy handbeg. But it's still good management and co worker to work on it.Their management treat us very well
good,Quick and easy to apply. Management needs work. Lack of training. The interview process was pretty neat and innovative. Easy to build relationships with the other associates.
good,I worked with customers helping them find exactly what they came in looking for and I provided customer service everyday. I was able to gain more communication skills and gain great customer service skills while on the job.
good,Una gran empresa con un gran equipo y eso facilita mucho a la hora de vender y desarrollar tus conocimientos a la hora de vender
good,"The management team as well as coworkers were all very friendly."
good,You work well with great people. Yet they do not give you the best pay. And if they do promote you they do not give you a big raise.
good,"I would check-in and have a 5 minute meeting with a manager about that week's GUESS news. Depending on what area I was working in that day, I would be placed accordingly in the store. Sometimes I would be a greeter, or in fitting rooms and other times on cashier. I learned a lot about finding what customers want and need to make successful transactions. Cashier skills were added to my knowledge and handling money at high volume. All of my co-workers were great people. The hardest part of my job was probably over-working myself due to others' lack of enthusiasm and the unprofessional-ism that came along with one of my new managers. Other than that, I loved working and meeting new individuals everyday. Obtaining new skills was the best part."
good,"(muchos problemas de servicio por fabricación en terceros paises.)"
good,Guess was not the greatest environment or very fun place to work at. It was one of my first jobs and it was a good learning experience.
good,"great place, good vibe and great people to work with. I was a sales associate greeting and helping customers make their working experience better."
good,"Fun work place with a great crew. Everytime I work, my skills at customer service improves. I also learned how to maintain a good relationship with costumers through communication and service."
good,"It was okay working for this company...didn't offer too much to me. If you like the clothes and EDM music, you'll love this place."
good,"If you want to work in a competitive, fun environment this is the place for you. A typical day at work is speaking to customers and achieving your daily targets. Nice discount and team, however no commission."
good,It was a fun store to work in. It was very productive and team-oriented. I had most of my stock experience when I was there.
good,"Open and closed store. Usually stayed around cash wrap to ring up clients, answering phone calls. Fold, fixed, steamed clothing that needed to be. Assisted clients with what they were looking for. Learned the company tends to lean in more to how you look rather than product. Very easy job, loved helping clients find what they needed and styling."
good,"When I started working a Guess I really liked the atmosphere, my coworkers, managers, and customers. But once my initial training was done, my weekly hours began to drop. None of my managers complained about my work, only giving me the occasional advice which I greatly appreciated. I started working in March, and by May I started to ask about more hours. I understood that I was a very new employee but I barely worked 5 hours a week, which really only gave me enough to pay for the gas to get there and though I live with my mom rent free I still had to pay for my car insurance which time and time again my mom would cover most of because I couldn't make a full payment.     "
good,This job was my first job after moving out to Los Angeles. The people that are considered my co-workers are more like family now. The customer base at my location lacked manners and could turn a fabulous day into an annoying one real quickly.
good,"Kept very close tabs on sales, and performance, very large drive to enhance self and store performance."
good,"My work day consisted of assisting customers in choosing items of clothing to wear, persuading them to buy merchandise, and operating the cash register. I learned how to handle different pressured situations and different personalities. Management was of a younger age than average, and my co-workers were relateable in that they were close to my age. The hardest part of the job was persuading customers to buy more than they intended. The most enjoyabole part of the job was interacting with different types of people."
good,"Great personal shopping with clients."
good,"Guess was enjoyable my first retail job."
good,A typical day involved assisting customers with shopping and becoming somewhat of a personal stylist.
good,"typical day at work included typical sales, keeping store clean. Relaxed management. Friendly co-workers. hardest part of the job was finger spacing while closing store. tedious work. most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with many people"
good,"This company makes you reach your personal goal for the week, month and year. It can be a fun workplace depending on which location you work at. If you make your goal, you are rewarded. Overall the company is okay."
good,Nice discount but don't let you have a decent lunch break and make you wear heels/dress up to portray Guess girl.
good,"Greeting & assisting all customers. Assisting clients with any merchandise needs. Assist with any transactions and/or purchases, etc."
good,"•	Act as cashier when needed."
good,"The typical day at work would be, arriving on time, check the inventory and make sure all the new products are on shelfs. I learned new customer service skills and how to handle very very angry customers. My cow-workers were cool."
good,Everything started out well and I would like to say that Guess as a company is great but I had a poor management team.
good,"•	 Responsible for opening and closing of the store"
good,"Mainly worked for holiday like black friday and christmas, because i needed the extra cash. I did enjoy greeting customers and helping girls find outfits for date nights. I love working with people and patients which is why i am studying in the medical field."
good,"GCS has no growth opportunities.  GCS does not provided raises.  GCS has subpar medical insurance.  Overall GCS was a fair place to work, clients appreciated the services, and thee are great colleagues,  it was not a place to expect your input to matter.  GCS did allow for individuality, however, it was a top-down office-community, wherein wage or cost-of-living increases factored little into the operations.  I enjoyed working with the staff members, and got along with my colleagues and supervisors, however, upon gaining my graduate degree, no new opportunities arose, nor was a salary increase gained."
good,Guess Factory was a great company to work for and came with many challenges that help mold my managerial skills.
good,"- journée très mouvementé"
good,"I enjoyed working with the GUESS company. Organizing the sales floor, and visual merchandising gave me a lot of creative freedom."
good,"commence le matin a 9h et fini a 14h45 ou 15h "
good,"Work an average 6 hour shift around 3-4 days a week, learned basic sales associate skills."
good,This company allows you to use your own ideas and strategies.
good,For me to be such a big Retail Company I think it should be organized better.
good,Co-workers are young. New employees every few months. four hour shifts.
good,"Co-workers were friendly, helped one another with whatever needed help with. Basically greet customers help them with any merchandise, clean the store."
good,I enjoyed the fact that I could see and learn about fashion and helped others feel good about themselves just by helping them pick out an outfit or helping them find the one article of clothing they need. 
good,A typical day at work mostly revolves around keeping customers/clients happy and maintaing the store. I have learned how to work cashiers and customer approaches. I have also learned a little about the visuals process of a retail store. Management is not the best in terms of communication but in every other aspect it is not bad. The hardest part of the job is scheduling around the part time work schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job is the friends one makes with both co-workers and clients.
good,"It is a great place to work, but stressful. You have to understand the price you will have to pay in order to succeed in this company. A lot of work, limited personal time.."
good,"There's really no sense writing a review for this store especially since there isn't a store in Royal Hawaiian Shopping Plaza anymore. Must say though, I the benefits at the time I used to work there was quite a hassle. Blue Cross Blue Shield is the health care provider that the company uses, but it's very difficult to use in a state that functions mostly with HMSA or Kaiser."
good,"Working I guess Marciano was an honor to the fact of a tie quality clientele and high and fashion branded attire however the salary was basically minimum-wage the only benefit of working there due to the fact management would not allow any employee to work more than part time hours was that you receive 50% off"
good,"Très bonne expérience, un travail qui m'a appris beaucoup de chose en tant que vendeuse."
good,"Review reports to generate sales "
good,"It was cool at first but then I started getting blamed for errors because I was the new girl. There was an assistant manager there that was racist (majority opinion). Every one else was cool, hung out outside of work. It was an overall fun environment besides that."
good,mi Piacerebbe cambiare perché dopo 10 anni il lavoro è diventato poco stimolante
good,The store I worked at had a lot of fun people to work with. I was a sales associate. The pay was not that great but it never really is for these kinds of jobs.
good,manque de communication entre les employer et les supérieur
good,"It was a job, while working there employees never recieved a raise and hadnt in years"
good,"Great place to work, with an incredible employee discount. Management was also young and great to work with. A typical day consists of providing customer service to customers, locating products and closing sales."
good,I didnt really like working here at all. Everything wasn’t really in order and the managers were inconsiderate to when people were sick. I had a bad experience working with this company
good,"Your co-workers are either on your team or they are not. And too often when corporate management hired people it didn't workout. The work enviornment can be really fast paced or nothing at all, it was alway a black and white situation."
good,I had a great time working there and loved my managers but the wages were low. There was not enough room to grow or to get a raise that I would want to stick around for. The retail experience was great though.
good,Greet guest as  they are walking in. Introduce yourself and present what they are looking for in particular. I've learned in many experiences one must learn how to trend and adapt to the variety of diverse colors and styles. Which brings to most difficult which involves that very bit. Great perk is discounted merchandise and the enjoyment of social interaction from all over the world.
good,Guess is a great company to work for especially as entry-level.  They will train and develop you into a well-rounded retail associate which is a great stepping stone for future careers.
good,"Very busy all the time, very fun to work there. Very competitive environment. Be nice to costumers, give them your name in order for them to say your name at the cashier."
good,"-typical working day would be not to busy, tasking."
good,"Guess taught me about managing the salesfloor and staff and sense of urgency with driving sales. has a lot of structure and learned all aspects of running a store: loss prevention, HR, visuals, people development."
good,It's a nice place to work at if you like working with customers & clothes. The staff is friendly & it's a great first time job. Very pleased with this company
good,It is a great brand and an interesting place to work for those who have an interest in the fashion and retail world. The hardest part of the job is that employees are required to make a certain amount of sales per hour.
good,"A typical day at work involves making sales in order to help reach both your personal goal as well as the store's overall goal. Considering that we do not make commission, there is a lot of competition when it comes to sales. This job helped me learn how to properly communicate with my co-workers as well as customers in a professional manner."
good,working at guess was a good experiment. i got to learn to communicate wit people and make good sales. the coworkers were also amazing.
good,"Loved my days at Guess!  Great environment, product sales it's self with top fashion and quality product.  High expectation, must be ready to give 100!"
good,"Guess? Is a great company to work for as they really work hard to provide great benefits for their employees. However, the management creates a high school like environment that contributes to a huge employee turnover and a very stressful work environment at times."
good,More supplies needed at the right time and place. not being able to enjoy your day off because your boss is calling you to discuss work. Management not motivated.
good,"This store was very very messy. Whether it was messy shirts on the table, messy backrooms, confusion between the workers or even disagreement between managers. The store never lacked passion. We had workers who worked hard to make visuals look good to the public eye. We had service that would make customers love coming back to the store. We had managers who hated each other but had an eye on what they wanted for the store and made sure it got there. But this was a long time ago, I'm sure with whatever the store went through, it is so much better now."
good,"* it's a typical sales job"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of multi-tasking in a face-paced environment, while interacting with an array of different cultures of people.  Attending to customers needs and wants of certain items of clothing and styles."
good,awesome clothes and accessories to sell. Helping customers is my favorite thing to do. I love making connections with clients as well..
good,"I was able to balance, work and school. I learned a lot about customer service and customer satisfaction. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping others, helping customers with the most updated fashion trends and personal needs; for example we would have customers come in and simply ask to coordinate an outfit for them for different events, weddings, sweet 16's, birthday, holiday parties, romantic dates, etc. That is what I enjoyed the most."
good,"It´s a great job for someone who is going to school and is looking for  just a few hours  and some extra money. It´s always fun and gives you a lot of time for studing."
good,"I love being a Manager, It was great being able to train and coach my associates on the spot. It was a great and fun work environment for the mangers as well as the associates. I loved being able to make my staff laugh and have fun while being able to give our customers the best in class service we could provide. Being able to make our customers smile and feel comfortable while wardrobing them and finding great gifts for their families. I strive to see my team grow and succeed in life and there is no greater feeling than to have a successful and bright team. Everyday was a learning experience from doing visuals,shipment,hiring, selling, customer service and training, there was never a dull moment. My store manager never followed P&P which was tuff for me because I was taught to follow the company's P&P. She didn't know how to separate her work life form her personal life, No one respected her as a store manager. I was the voice for my team from the managers to the associates, Everyone came to me with their issues and problems because they knew I cared and would help them the best I could. I love customer service, working with and meeting new people is something I love to do."
good,"Great working atmosphere, fun and ambitious team leaders creating a unique company culture. Very sales oriented, and hard work is always recognized and rewarded. The best part of working at Guess are the people you work with, the downside is that there is little opportunity for rapid advancement."
good,"Meeting new people"
good,"Come into work, get a name tag from the back and sign in while greeting the very friendly co-workers. The hardest part of the job was that they would get you sale goals and sometime they make the goals so high that it's sometimes impossible to reach. When the day is over and you don't reach those goals the managers beat down on you than you feel awful about yourself when going home. The most enjoyable part is the new people you get to meet and all their different stories about how they ended up working at this location."
good,"Good store, amazing clothes, little pay, few hours a week, was not working with my needs."
good,"This company is great for anyone looking to move up in a company.  I started out working at Guess as an associate, and really enjoyed it!  I would get recognition for all my hard work and really felt appreciated.  Shortly after, my managers had a talk with me about moving up into management.  Working at Guess really advanced my career and taught me a lot about fashion, retail and business.  It definitely opens up a lot of doors!"
good,"è un bellissimo negozio, i clienti vengono per il marchio e per la merce che comunque guess offre, ma per lo staff c'è molto caos perchè far combaciare 15 ragazze non è facile, però non è un brutto posto di lavoro."
good,This company had great work life balance. But job security was a concern as well as advancement.
good,"Folding clothing and dressing manikins. learned new styles. Management was young fair and friendly . co workers were young most of us new each other already not enough hours tho, and wage was minimum. The clothing was nice"
good,"A typical day at work I would open the store make sure it was ""show time ready"" cleaning, replening, making sure that the store was maintained on a visual level as well as operational level. I learned many skills about retail and running a store from a internal and external prospective. my co-workers were always great to work with as I made sure to keep the selling culture and over all aura of the store positive, the hardest part of the job was making sure that everything was in order for corperate visits as the store was a flag ship store we had many visits. in the end of it all the best part was feeling accomplished knowing that the job was done and seeing the numbers roll in."
good,"Days spent merchandising and assisting customers. Learned better loss prevention techniques being in a city environment. Support managers where knowledgable about business and assisted openly in daily operations. Hardest part of the day was dealing with the non-stop external theft attempts which sometimes took away from our paying customers. Most enjoyable part was the staff, both management and sales and meeting customers from all parts of the world visiting the Atlantic City area."
good,"I due anni trascorsi dentro questa azienda mi hanno permesso di conoscere responsabili capaci di svolgere il loro lavoro, qualcuno di loro in modo impeccabile! Purtroppo l'azienda in due anni ha cambiato molti district manager e questo ha portato numerosi problemi, e contrasti all'interno degli stessi negozi, come capita dappertutto al giorno d'oggi le valutazioni sulle dipendenti sono state influenzate da altri fattori, e il risultato di questa pessima gestione è stato che gente come me dopo due anni è andata a casa e magari gente più simpatica è rimasta a tempo indeterminato! Vi assicuro che all'interno di questa azienda se non fossi stata capace di svolgere il mio lavoro non sarei mai rimasta 2 anni, cambiando 4 store manager, 2 sedi di lavoro, e all'occorrenza ho fatto anche il jolly per alcune settimane in altri due punti vendita, evidentemente riesco ad adattarmi bene in ogni situazione, all'interno dei negozi si lavora con obiettivi ben precisi, e sia io che il resto del mio gruppo abbiamo dato il massimo per raggiungerli.Ma questo non è servito a nulla, per evitare di tornare "" a spasso""!"
good,"J'exerce mon travail au sein d'une équipe relativement jeune, en effet la moyenne d'age est de 25ans. Ce qui me permet d'exercer au sein d'une ambiance joviale. Une complicité entre employés et responsables s'est instauré sans difficulté?"
good,"It's a great learning experience if you want to get your hands wet in retail sales. And if you have a way with words and a sparkling personality, breaking even for commission shouldn't be a problem."
good,"This is a good place for any one to start out...it's a fun filled environment, but not much oppourtunity for hours or advancement"
good,I really enjoyed my job here. just not enough hours. i also felt that in this company there was no room for advancement. They offer min wage and min hours so its really hard to make this a full time job.
good,"This company, like every company have its' up and down. Although it is a public company, it is still run like a private company."
good,There was a big change in upper management about 6 months into working there. The new management that took over didn't seem fit for there roles which ultimately resulted in my decision to leave and change up my career.
good,They know that this is mind-numbing boring work so they offer you a great benefits package to keep you showing up. Very little opportunity for advancement. A lot of drama between little cliques and also between departments. There are departments with easy light-duty work and others with tough physical labor. The worst part is when you're on first shift m-f they will more or less hijack your weekends by telling you to plan to work Saturday every week and then not make a decision until 30 mins before you get off on Friday on whether we work or not so you can never make plans.
good,"I would definitely go back to working for the company as I enjoyed working there"
good,the job overall is your regular retail experience.. the hours being provided to me were not enough for me to make ends meet with the responsibilities I had that is why I did not stay with the company for long.
good,"I learned a lot about customer service and how to sell our items well. The manager and management team were lovely and if I had a problem I felt as though I could approach them. The best part of the job was knowing that work would be a good environment and that there wasn't going to be an issue or tension between the staff. However, the hardest part was trying to deal with rude persistent customers in the best way possible."
good,Company offer a great pay but you have to work holidays and most of the weekends. Manager was fair but when the holidays come there is a mandatory black out that unfortunately employees are not able to take days off.
good,Nice place to work at if you're going to school. They work with your schedule. Not very long shifts if you are a part-timer. Overall great place to start working
good,You had to learn everything about guess jeans which is okay but I think it would have been better to know a general understanding about the jeans. They started selling jeggings and cheap materials after I quit and thank goodness I left when they did that because I have no idea how you could up-sell cheap but expensive clothes.
good,Guess was good place to work for only problem is they weren’t giving me no hours. I never received breaks which I didn’t really needed them but over all it’s a good place for like a teenager to work for.
good,I was able to work at a fast pace in a very workable place and a friendly environment to work in. Competitive wage pay. I was able to help customers that needed help in searching for certain clothing. Being able to keep the clothes organize.
good,Bonne culture organisationnelle et possibilité d'avancement de carrière
good,The culture of this company is great and everyone i worked with was amazing. it was only difficult because the store was really big and your services wouldn't be  easily recognized
good,"Typical day was keeping the store looking clean and presentable. Engaging with customers. Working at guess I learned to excel with my sales and customer service, while also making friends with the staff. I enjoyed working there because of the other staff. Management was okay but could have definitely used some work. At times they could be very disorganized, ex. sending in RTO 5 months prior, being told it was okay and then a week before the trip being notified the RTO was never sent in and there would be a write up if there was a no show for the days they scheduled. Hardest and most enjoyable part of the job would be the day to day with customers, building connections, and seeing your regulars."
good,"A typical day at Guess would be interacting with people (especially tourists) which you learn a lot from when you are working on your sales. The environment is small and comfortable... the more sales you make with our top clients, the quicker you adjust. the hardest part of the day would be not doing anything. the store is small so you sometimes run out of things to do and there would be days where no one would step foot in the store for hours."
good,Awesome team relationship. Sales are top priority and providing excellent customer service is an essential part of the job. Its always a great feeling when a customer leaves the store satisfied.
good,"Typical day includes opening the store, processing shipment, customer service. "
good,Working at guess is a job that is okay for someone starting their first job and has low expenses. Its not to much room for growth. Its a job that is based on traffic. If traffic is low in the store they will start cutting shifts.
good,If you like fast paced environments then this is the job for you. I've always liked guess clothing and working there has not taken that away from me. It's something one should look into if they are interested in retail.
good,"Work under a lot of pressure, have to adhere to any day situations like month end or specials, dealing with lots of people at once. We have good management. I learnt how to work with customers, how to deal with clients and making them happy"
good,"a great way to learn about retail & fashion. The GUESS culture is all about their people. They love to motivate staff with perks within the store."
good,My overall experience was great. The managers were very helpful and everyone was very friendly. It was a good job to have while I was in Arizona.
good,"Fun and loving environment to work in, as well as flexible work schedule, with various incentives. However, the co workers can be very upsetting sometimes."
good,"- We were all basically friends"
good,"During the time I was working, I was enrolled in college. Balancing was a bit rough because I was also helping my family's business. Overall, working here was fun and fashionable. I learned the art of selling and how to sell to customers. I also learned how to interact and speak to customers without being shy. My co-workers were nice and made a great team. The management here also taught me about conversions and making goal sales."
good,"Ao longo do dia cuido de notas fiscais, auxilio em atendimento ao cliente, elaboro planilhas."
good,"Good for a seasonal jobs"
good,Learned how to manage a cash register and built better communication skills with customers. Very outgoing managers that were flexible with any needs.
good,"Getting to work i have to prepare the store to be opened. I open registers, insure night time staff did the correct store closing procedures. Then i would assign cleaning tasks to the staff who would come in the morning with me. I then go to the back print out all require reports to relate to the business. From there i create a selling cover sheet, going over what our project sales goal for the day needs to be and what we need to sell per hour to meet our store sales target. After all store reports are examined i then begin my daily duties as a manager, my staff and i have to sell an average dollar per hour. Im on the sales floor selling clothes to customers, building cliental by giving excellent customer service. "
good,"Long hours to be expected at this clothing retail chain.  If you want quality of life you have to think twice about working there."
good,"needed something more stable, but the pay rate is reasonable."
good,Guess provides great benefits. They have alot to offer to those who want to keep moving up within the company. Guess has a friendly environment with customer service being their priority.
good,"I learned time management and the importance of it, I handled stock manacans credit card and cash transactions, co workers were helpful  the hardest part of my job was standing the most enjoyable would be the music and helping customers with there fashion needs."
good,GUESS provide a very friendly and fun environment where you get to enjoy the energizer atmosphere.  It's a place where you meet different people throughout the day and helps you build and shape customer service skills
good,i enjoyed working there i met knew and exciting co-workers who are now my friends. management was ok. Could have been better on giving hours and setting up schedules.
good,"-A typical day consists of routine cleaning in the morning. Throughout the day, customers are being assisted and rung up at the cashier. We are eager to sign customers up for the Guess List Rewards Card."
good,"Great Atmosphere and work experience. I interact with various people of different backgrounds, ethnic groups, and walks of life. I enjoy and excel at helping others feel comfortable and invited, while keeping in mind their 'needs' and the company's overall goal to attract new customers and maintain strong relationships with returning shoppers."
good,"Working in retail tends to be similar from one store to another; different customers every day, new displays being updated on weekly basis, sales targets and goals, as well as many of hours spent on your feet."
good,"I formed many lasting friendships at Guess, and I loved my job.  I was given the opportunity to cross train in several areas of the business and participate on cross functional project teams.  The schedule was flexible and benefits were some of the best that I've seen.  Management is inconsistent and there is little opportunity for advancement."
good,It's a nice place to work its fast paste and you have to be able to multi task
good,"- Mi occupavo dell'apertura/chiusura del punto vendita, inviare mail in azienda ,contabilità, ricezione merce... rimanente parte della mia giornata mi dedicavo alla vendita"
good,Selling Guess product to the general public. Cashing out the customers. Loss prevention measures throughout the store.
good,"The manager I had when I started working there ended up just leaving and screwed everyone over, but then someone came in and saved the whole store so it worked out but it was really frustrating for a long time, and you need a lot of patience for the customers because they're literally horrible demon spawns"
good,"Guess company quick place to work,good location, good people to work with,they know what they want, not too much change work, no confusing, benefit ok."
good,Learned a lot when it came to stocking and how to fold correctly. Working at the GUESS Factory showed me team playing and to always be aware of surroundings.
good,A typical day at work would be to make sure customers are being taken care of. I learned how to better interact with customers and how to solve difficult situations appropriately. The management at the store was good upper management has opportunities to be better and connect with the employees more. The culture of the workplace is very fast paced. The hardest part of the job is making sure everyone is on task and also trying to make money in a company that is extremely focused on traffic (how many customers are coming in/out of the store) to transaction ratio. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to style customers for events they were attending.
good,"Includes fitting customers with Guess apparel, organizing clothing, and cashier. The management is very nice and easy to work with. No high stress times at this company!"
good,"I love working here as you get to meet different people that for one was my enjoyable part of the job"
good,"I think this job is good but it could of been a lot better. The thing is I started working at this place at 18 and the upper management  made me feel welcome like any other job should, but only after a week or two things quickly changed. They dropped me into some favoritism category thing and made me feel as if all my time spend there was unnecessary and not worth it. It's not like I reached late or didn't do my job to they're standards, I did everything 110% and still got under paid, unappreciated, and over worked."
good,"I turni di lavoro sono organizzati in base agli orari di apertura del punto vendita. Io lavoravo in un centro commerciale aperto dalle 9 del mattino alle 22 e chiuso esclusivamente il giorno di Natale, 1 Gennaio e a Pasqua. L'azienda retribuisce adeguatamente le ore lavorate nei giorni festivi. "
good,"I learned how to engage with customers and a team player. I expanded my customer service skills, and learned more about promoting a company products."
good,"For a first time job, retail is the way to go. flexible with hours, fun, and a good learning experience. You learn people skills, and how to sell."
good,Guess is a nice place to work. The people are really friendly not so much about the people who controlled guess. You never really seen them and if you did they weren't to friendly.
good,This is where I got my start at visual merchandising. Working here was more task filled. Customer service was a big deal but ultimately there was way more to do than there wasn't. The staff here was rather large so it did have its fun times dealing with a lot of people. But as we all know dealing with different people comes with different attitudes. Shifts went by pretty quick due to the amount of work there was to do . The clothes basically sell itself so its all about outfitting and adding on.
good,"It's a retail job, and there are pluses and negatives to working in that industry, but the environment that the management has created in the store makes for a great work experience."
good,"Definitely the place to work and shop if you are the dressing up type. If it's a night out on the town or maybe a date, this store had you covered. With shoes, bags, and accessories also."
good,"A typical day at work is another day to utilize and develop new skills. Skills in customer service, team work, job effectiveness and efficiency. The best part of the job is that you learn each day- from your co-workers and also from job role. Putting a smile on customer's faces and getting recommended to their friends or family, and being highly referred by customers to my managers and other senior staff. My job as a sales associate as sharpened my interpersonal skills in regards to effectively communicating with different personalities, either co-workers or a potential client. Such vital skills can be transferred and applied in all vocational fields."
good,"A typical day at Guess was fast paced with always something to do. so team work and time management were key in running a successful day. "
good,"una giornata tipo comprende senz'altro un lavoro di squadra. C'è molta comunicazione e confronto tra tutti. Non viene mai sottovalutata l'opinione o il consiglio di nessuno. Questo permette di mantenere sempre un clima sereno e propositivo."
good,"If you're looking for a fun environment to work in, this is the place for you! It is a very operational establishment. I was able to learn a lot about inventory, shipment, and floor moves."
good,"Working at Guess was fun, but managers used put sooo much pressure on employees to sell stuff. I am very social and had no problem selling clothes to customers, but they used to remember employees every second the selling goals of the day. Once I stepped in the store, I felt literally overwhelmed."
good,"Ce qui est avantageux c'est l'esprit d'equipe, nous sommes une petite famille s'entraidant dans tout.L'aspect difficile C'est de vendre le maximum de vêtement en une journée.j'ai apprise plusieurs choses en travaillant au guess comment communiquer avec la clientèle, rechercher leur besoin etc."
good,"A typical day at work i ran a register and rang up customers sales."
good,"A typical day at work was selling merchandise to customers, with a goal every shift of no less than $1000 that you had to sell. My shifts were filled with fun and laughter. I learned to communicate better with people I have never even met before. I learned patience, independence and most of all responsibility. My co-workers were amazing, very welcoming and kind. The hardest part of the job was the clean up after hours, sometimes we would be there really late just cleaning up every part of the store ex. shoes, clothes, purses etc. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably meeting new people and gaining experience in the work field. "
good,"I only worked there at a part timer so i usually work Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Sometimes i worked Mondays and some private special events at my main location and other locations as well. I did like my job, thats why i worked there for almost 2 years and a half. I love my team mates as well, i think of Guess as my 2nd home and with the people that i enjoy working with. The only problem was the managements, which meants they switched the managers after every 6 months. Though, i dont mind that. Just recently, the managers that i work with was treating us like in a inhuman and unfair ways. No one even gets along with them, especially the general manager. Another problem is everyone knows that managers are not allow to work in the same location if they're in the relationship.However, they're dating in the downlow and wont let people notice. No one would even dare to tell the Head Manager cause they're afraid to lose their job. But that is the reason why i left the job. Overall, i like who i used to work with and i will never forget those good moments ever in my life."
good,"I enjoyed my job as an associate. I later got promoted to Assistant Manager and took on a lot more roles in the company. I enjoyed doing floorsets and being a visual merchandiser. I would open/close the store, make bank drops,clean the store,customer service,make schedules,check payroll, keep track of weekly/monthly sales, bookkeeping,in charge of interviewing and recruiting. As a manager i assisted in training and coaching, making sure all shifts are covered, and assisting the store manager in all aspects. I enjoyed the fun pace."
good,Guess is a really fast pace environment you have to be able to adapt. you also need to be good with number but those are all things that are taught along the way. I had an amazing team which made things  much easier . However upper management is only concerned with what store mangers have to say they don't care much about there assistant manger there is a huge disconnect. they forget that every piece of the puzzle is important. some of upper management  is good with the staff others need a little support with there people and interaction skills .
good,"Although it was simply a retail position, I speak fondly of Guess due to the positive work environment. It served me well in teaching me how to market the brand, speak to others, and respect the customer. Overall, it gave me a great leap forward in the business industry, as well as taught me team-building skills throughout my time as an associate."
good,Management was amazing always flexible with notice when it came to scheduling. Chances to learn a lot and advance. Company needs to go through some rebranding to keep up with new styles and culture. Better promotions and merchandising should be a goal for the company. Set goals for stores based on their demographic. I no longer work for GUESS because they closed our store with a short notice. Didn’t offer any options of transferring.
good,It was a seasonal job so the pay was very good at first. Work pace started to get slow during the month of January. Work load was pretty well balanced.
good,"a typical day at work is fun , ive learned a lot about fashion ,the team was amazing , the hardest part of the work was certainly keeping a good ratio. the most enjoyable part was talking to the customers and helping them ."
good,"una empresa muy recomendable para trabajar, ya que te permite crecer dia a dia"
good,"Working at Guess has been a great experience for me because I've learned so much. with me being so interested in the retail world, working at guess has challenged me to learn fabrics, styles, colors and much more. as a men's brand manager my daily job description is protecting my department and serving the customer our best styles. although it is challenging it has been a great gateway into visuals for my career."
good,Job security isn't the best. I've seen them fire employees that had been there for 10+ years and replace them with temps. Once a month they do layoffs and anyone can be on the list.
good,"Learned to deal with all type of customers; had assistance anytime that I needed. "
good,Un ambiente professionale e stimolante  con ottima organizzazione e strategie aziendali per il raggiungimento degli obiettivi in generali.
good,"Guess è un ambiente molto formale,ma comunque formato di un team di giovani,quindi diventava a volte dinamico e le ore pesanti passavano comunque"
good,"over all company is good, just management turn over rate is horrible."
good,The girls were always friendly and outgoing. Selling is a big part of this job and so is customer service. When customers walk through the door you greet them and ask if they are looking for anything in particular.
good,"40% discount on clothes was nice. The schedule for tech support was the best: Four 10-hour days, Three days off."
good,"There do not have a commission based salary anymore. That means you would only get paid by the hour, and their hourly rate is very low."
good,"For the company in general,"
good,I really enjoy working here and meeting new people. This job is fun and fast paced. Working at guess factory I've learned a lot about fashion and how to use different styles to make an outfit. I enjoy getting to kmow customers and helping out returning customers. Overall working here and doing your job well will help you to move up in the company.  Their is always room to grow.
good,I enjoy working for the company but I had to relocated and my location doesn't have a guess I had no choice but to leave the company  if I could back I would be much
good,"Guess was a fun place to work at. I got to meet many great people in the process who I was able to train and help grow within the company. Working here taught me time management, to be responsible and te be a team player."
good,"working at this type of company can be a challenge if you cant make sales, because its on commission , depending on the location , every work location is different"
good,Working at Guess was a pleasurable experience overall in my opinion. The culture was very inviting and fun. The stress level was intense but definitely worth it.
good,"working at guess made me develop patience and build myself to become stronger and learn to understand different cultures and religions from around the world, also how to work with different people ;i also learned how to work inside and outside of your comfort zone and how communication is key."
good,"A typical day at GUESS! includes, inventory, floor sets, and helping out customers so that they leave our store happy. The staff and management at guess are very helpful, and professional. We always get through all of the tasks that we need to for the day, while still having fun. Working at guess has taught me to be a little more patient with people, because since it is an outlet store located in a popular place, we get a lot of customers from all over the world, who do not speak English and you have to try your best to help them out the best that you can, its definitely a challenge, but a fun challenge. Overall working at guess is very enjoyable. "
good,"The job was fun while it lasted, however; they werent sympathetic to the fact of anyones personal, spiritual and educational life at all."
good,i really enjoyed the time being there it was fun. you leanred stuf from other people. it was a very fast wroking enviorment. sometimes it was stressful . and felt pressured
good,"Guess Was A Great Place To Learn Good Communication Skills , You Where Able To Get Over Your Shy Stages Because Of The Responsibities I Really Liked Being A Team Member There"
good,"A very friendly environment."
good,"It is a fun environment for a first job, but not for long due to lack of hours given a week. Managers are very understanding when needing of a day off or not able to make a scheduled day"
good,Rewarding workplace if you like to interact with people follow trends and enjoy selling. Guess sticks to tradition and believes in the product that they sell.
good,"The store appearance is important for the company, so we usually make sure merchandise is properly folded and sizes are placed accordingly. We get the opportunity to up-sell and suggestive sale."
good,"puede ser muy divertido entre os que trabajan en la empresa"
good,"Guess was always a dream job if mine, the full time I been here I very much enjoyed it, but towards the end of my leave just a few weeks before we received a new store manager.  seemed nice at first. I put in my two weeks due to another job offer. The store called her to get her feedback. Sosktbunf negative was said and it prevented me from getting the job. I never had a problem with her, she even offered me a job back, giving me the impression she wanted me back if I wanted to come or not."
good,Good for entering the work force. Flexible depending on management but advancement opportunities are not readily available. Good discounts for employees.
good,Il y a une très grande rotation de employés mais j'ai apprécie mon expérience de travail au Guess.
good,Very Pleaseant work environment able to learn something new everyday. No two days were the same a very diverse customer base everyday was a different experience.
good,"A great clothing company and the fellow employees were great. A typical day consisted of folding clothing, assisting with selection and  monitoring the trying-on of clothes to protect the product,"
good,Fast pace place to work in. Learned a lot about customer service. Management was not fair there at times. Work place culture was okay. The hardest part of this job was the pay with no raises. The most enjoyable part was the growth in job opportunities.
good,"Guess is a great place to work at if you enjoy multitasking, working in a fast paced environment, and helping customers overall it's retail. Great hours depending on your daily sale goals, good management on average. Not so good benefits if your just a sales associate."
good,"customer service everyday. I learned to act professional is a short time frame. Management was fair, treated everyone equally. My co workers were all a pleasure to work with, always an enjoyable experience. The hardest part of the job was the schedule, because it was not flexible with my school schedule. The most enjoyable part is being able to have a work experience there. "
good,"Go to work sale,sale ,sale! Learing and knowing your prouduct. Working as a team to reach your goal and the stores goal."
good,During a typical work day I generally tend to customers trying to style and suggest items for them or pointing them in the direction of items that they purposely came in for all the while balancing out any tasks that need to be completed visually for the store standards and deadlines.
good,Compagnie Américaine alors les décisions sont laborieuse et longue avant d'avoir les réponses.
good,"Too many managers, good co-workers, hard to please both employees and managemnet."
good,"Fun and productive,good environment well manged, clean always presentable. good co- workers great team players. hardest part of the job is trying to talk to and help the people that speak different languages. & the most enjoyable part is coming in contact with some many different people everyday"
good,"A typicall clothing retail store. Not fisically demanding, and very accomodating,"
good,I merchandise from the moment i come in to the moment I leave.

good,I enjoyed working at Guess and thankful for the position I recieved. I learned A LOT and experienced a lot of different/new things. It is a huge place with responsibility and requires strong passion for the job and company. A large field of growth with many opportunities.
good,Retail is always fun if you have other employees that help make the day fun. There were days where it was extremely slow and we had day's where we were slammed. The customers helped make the days more enjoyable!
good,I must say working at guess has always been one of the most exciting experiences I've ever had and still do. I have learned a lot and still do every single day with the energetic team I have.
good,I must say working at guess has always been one of the most exciting experiences I've ever had and still do. I have learned a lot and still do every single day with the energetic team I have.
good,"We have hard work and a team spirit, we are working as a team."
good,Working at Guess wasn't the best sales experience for me. The manager was very rude and unprofessional. Co workers were very rude. My manager was never really around to oversee anything.
good,"If there is one lifestyle brand that will really make your day as you visit such, that would be GUESS, you have the money ? Go bring it all from head to toe offering total look. Fabulously perfect. I loved and enjoyed working in this even I crawl literally going home at the end of the day. One of the best times working with more than 10 nationalities and lot`s of moments."
good,"training others and helping them be the best at what they do , is the best part of my job. they are a lot of great people working for this company."
good,Provides exceptional customer service in retail sales. Willing to take added responsibility. It is very efficient and well maintained.
good,Very challenging environment and limited growth. You can grow but at extreme costs to personal and professional life.

good,Working at Guess thought me a lot about costumer service and how to better understand their needs.
good,"Aangename collega's en leuke werksfeer."
good,"Overall good experience, friendly co-workers/staff and a nice atmosphere."
good,"A typical day working at Guess is check the floor to replenish any products both men's and women's clothing to be brought out for display. Later, I handle any online orders from customers over the computer as well as over the phone. Lastly shipment that arrived early in the afternoon must be completed and maintain organization in the stockroom.  Working in Guess helped me break through my shell and taught me how to be verbal with my communication to both my coworkers and customers. The workplace culture is strict with managers that have high expectations from both Stock and Sales Associates which brought a lot of pressure for me at the beginning but working through that pressure served me well throughout the years I have worked there. There are very few enjoyable moments working in Guess but the only enjoyable part were the people that I work with that make my day better."
good,"it was fun to work because i got on with the people "
good,Working at Guess was a very fun and rewarding experience. More than half the time you are on the sales floor helping clients with their outfits or seeing what would better suit their style.
good,"I have worked at Guess for 5 years, as a manager for 3 and recently minimum wage was raised but my wage was not, making my associates at the exact same wage as me. I am currently fighting for a raise which I am having a hard time with. Guess doesn’t give raises and seems to not appreciate their employees. I love my team & the environment but the company as a whole, is extremely unfair to their employees."
good,The Riverwalk mall is a tough place to work. The external theft is high and shoplifters do it in your face. The security is unable to do anything and the police can't get there in time.
good,A typical day at G By Guess would be busy with processsing shippment and checking out costomers. Also remembering to get and assist them throughout their vist.
good,"Guess is a great company to work for.  My boss was recently replaced with a seasoned Guess district manager that lives in Las Vegas.  Guess offers a large range of training tools to help with your business.  In the Livermore location, we are constantly busy so there is little to no down time.  The Livermore outlets are also very competitive and hard to staff.  I love the product I sell and I have an amazing discount."
good,"a great place to start off working, basic job for obtaining some background experience. best for summer job or working during the holidays. very fast paced."
good,Working at Guess was fun and relaxed. It was nice to interact with the staff and the customers and help them with their shopping experience. The culture was always very friendly and it was enjoyable to go to work.
good,If you are ready to compete for sales then guess is your place. I had a decent experience but my manager was not friendly at all. They fired her so i heard so i may give them a call back lol
good,Fun work atmosphere and great way to make new friends! Everyone that I worked with got along with one another. Love my Guess family even though we all went separate ways.
good,This was a exciting atmosphere...seeing new faces everyday..and challenging yourself to meet the customers needs and style to boost their confidence and make them comfortable about the purchase
good,It was my first retail job at the age of 19. I really enjoyed and it learned a lot about the business and retail in general. I helped me become the manager I am today.
good,"very easy job, constantly meeting new people, I loved it over all. they worked great with my school schedule. I still had time to have a life, study and focus on school, which is most definitely a win win situation for me."
good,"This job most suits high school or college students. they work with your school schedule and its a fun environment. The only thing is that you'll be folding clothes all day, and beware of that ONE angry customer. Other than that its a fun place to work."
good,"When you start you begin with a talk from a member of management. They inform you of your personal target for the day and what the store is aiming to achieve. You are then placed in a section of the store and are rotated around every hour."
good,"El trabajo en Guess se puede decir que realmente fue mi primer trabajo, donde era bastante rutinario el día a día, pero me logro enseñar el arte que tiene el vender. Cosas que uno no toma en cuenta al entrar a la tienda y el como sin darnos cuenta, los asesores de ventas nos va impulsando y generando un deseo para adquirir el producto. "
good,I had an interesting experience by dealing with different customers from different background and cultures... convincing them that their choice on our product where the most good feeling for the task...
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced but at times it was very slow! You have learn how to manage your time and keep yourself busy. I learned how to speak in a more formal manner. When you first start out, the employees weren't as helpful and sometimes rude.The most enjoyable part of the job is working with goal oriented people, motivation is great especially coming from your co-workers."
good,great place to work at the only bad thing was the hours if the store is really slow hours would be cut to 8 hrs a week or less. Manages were great.
good,"Productive workplace, always challenging, always an opportunity to learn something daily and keep motivated. Great product and customer service is first priority."
good,"Guess was a fun place to work, room there was a lot of room for advancement if you showed potential. Very Goal, and team oriented Training was excellent. A great first job to get your foot in the door. Some negatives were that upper management showed favoritism, and we were made to buy the clothing and stay ""current"" which was expensive even with the employee discount."
good,"This was a hands on college education for me, considering I never went. The manager who hired me from my work with 3d Sourcing, left for a bigger opportunity, and from there everything changed within our division. Along with huge lay offs, because of the drop in numbers."
good,"Great company, great clothing and great customers. I learned a lot about managing a variety of different personalities, lots of interaction with foreign customers, analyzed reports and ran meetings, learned creative ways to drive business sales. The most enjoyable part was just interacting with customers and giving great service."
good,You have to clock-in right away and put a headset on as well as start working on any shipment and organizing the sales floor. I learned that fashion could be fun and the management part of the business is pretty okay. Some of the co-workers do majority of the work while others just talk most of the time. Most of the co-workers did not like the store manager. I also enjoyed working with the customers and helping them find any merchandise as well as picking/suggesting some of the merchandises for them.
good,"I worked for guess for a year, in that time I was never approached about moving forward with a CAREER with the company. I also found it hard to have time for my child working weeks as long as 60+ hours at one point."
good,"-clocking into work a brief discussion of the sales goals that were are aiming for that day, restocking of inventory, working dressing rooms, folding clothing."
good,hard to advance your career with this company without being a suck up.
good,"A typical day would clean up the store, sweep, clean mirrors and make sure the store is neat before we open. I did a mixture of cash and sales associate. Helping customers and promoting the clothes. I learned a lot about the different styles of the fashion we sold at the store. The management was far and easy going. Treated everyone as equals and made it enjoyable for the staff to work for them. They appreciated and acknowledge when you went that extra mile. The co-workers were all nice, we all respected everyone and acted like professionals. The hardest part was the long hours. The most enjoyable part was seeing all the new fashion that was coming in and out of the store and helping customers."
good,Provide superior customer service and fulfill high levels of product knowledge expectations Adhere to all company policies and procedures had a good time
good,"Will gain knowledge about the behind the scenes, and process about G by Guess. Amazing managers and crew to guide and teach you how to succeed in the work place."
good,J’aime beaucoup la vente mais un cdi 25h ne pas plus intéresser donc j’ai préféré partir
good,"You are helping customers find the perfect item wether it be accessories. clothing, or shoes. very fast paced, but very fun work environment to work in."
good,"It’s a great job for people beginning to learn about retail. G by Guess will teach about sales product, stock work, greetings customers, cashier work, and teamwork."

good,"Working with Guess gave me the opportunity to gain more experience in retail.  They helped me learn new techniques, and proper ways to handle the customers."
good,"Great management and a good opportunity for growth in the company. not a typical retail store where everything gets trashed, good quality items and a good experience"
good,"it was wonderful working here, everything was well taught and training was given in advance. always willing to work with you if you need help. strict on attendance, dress code  was always so fun and creative."
good,"Working for Guess was a very good experience for me. I had got to move from store to store, do opening and closing different stores around the region and learn a lot of new things about this specific industry."
good,"Guess? Inc. is a fantastic, exemplary model of the fashion industry and retail as a whole. In my time there I learned quite a lot about designer style and how to sell it. The most enjoyable part of my job as a sales associate was the team I worked with."
good,"I enjoyed my job because I love helping others and because the people we worked with made job bearable, the manager is probably another reason why we loved our job but pay and hours can use improvement"
good,This company focuses on strengths and makes an effort to develop weaknesses. This is a great traing ground for a novice associate looking to develop their retail skills and possibly grow in the field.
good,"Over all it's ok working at Guess, it is very fast-paced most of the time. I don't think that management does a very good at training employees, they pretty much teach you basic stuff then have you figure everything else out. The hardest part of the job is probably dealing with bulk buyers because most of them always want different types of discounts and get bothered easily if something they want is not n the store or online stock."
good,En tant que commis jai appris le travail d'entrepot et jai pas de probleme de force physique et suis tres athletique alors mon integration ses bien passe
good,"Certainly focused on high sales, had many contests encouraging increasing the bottom line.  Had a great store manager and generally enjoyed my time there."
good,The hardest part of the job is to close because the place would be a mess and you can start cleaning up until it’s closing time. And if the store is packed you’re supposed to move super fast and help every single customer there
good,"The Soho District brings a lot of tourism from young trendsetters all over the world. Though the Soho location is smaller than the flagship located on 5th ave, the traffic do not stop. Be prepared to constantly be moving around the store."
good,It was a great experience to work with Guess team. Such an amazing team. Best part to help customer to find what they looking and expecting for. See them when they leave the store with a smile in face.
good,"a typical day at Guess will just be going in and start cleaning the cash-wrap so we wont have to stay there that late. And ring out people as fast as we can while getting loyalties so they can come back to shop with us again. What i learned at Guess is that you have to move fast and have patients with the customer. Management was ok, that's all i have to say. The hardest part of Guess was having to stay there so late and then coming back that same day to open or to do it all over again with little to sleep. The most enjoyable part of Guess is the connection you make with the co-workers everyone there is older enough to act like an adult and the treat you like one."
good,great place to meet people and have fun. causal work environment where you can work part time and learn new skills sales and visually while getting to knows the ins and outs of retail
good,"Working at Guess was very fun, as a morning/ mid-shift associate,  you come in with a sales orientated mindset, as a closer, you are more cleaning orientated. At night, is when it is more laid back, and managers allow conversations with other associates. Mid-shifts and openers mustn't talk or are suggested not to until traffic dies down."
good,"My past experience as a Sales Associative forced me to learn how to communicate with numerous people. I learned how to communicate and help various people. Also, the job's requirements were to always stay focused and positive."
good,"Since I worked in a small team, I could get to learn everything related to fashion design and production, from researching concept to production. However designers had to take responsibility for production tech packs and production lab dip approval, work load for designer was way too much."
good,"Great job environment but also unprofessional at the same time. Very easy job, very positive work environment, some managers work with you and others dont."
good,È un azienda logistica ben gestita in cui ti riesci ad ambientare subito .
good,Learned how to assist customers in retail setting. Had a great time styling customers. Hardest part would be looking for a size in the back and cleaning up after a shift.
good,"- opened cash registers in the morning"
good,"Working at Guess provided me with many valuable skills to use in the future such as customer service experience, money handling, as well as multitasking."
good,it was okay working at Guess. but the hours was not enough for me to pay my bills. and they was not willing to give no more hours. Sometimes they'll give the hours to their favorites and not who need it the most.
good,"As a head cashier, will call our loyal customers to let them know about the promotions in the store, will open cashier and make sure that we had enough change for the day, make sure that the deposit was complete with manager so we could go and deposit at the bank also in closing the store count the money and make sure that we had the money complete and put in the save"
good,"Since this is your normal retail giant, the small guys can get lost in the mix. But the ethics of the company seemed great while I worked there and the district managers always seemed on top of things."
good,GUESS was a pretty well balanced workplace that taught me a lot when it comes to customer service.I would definitely recommend this to a friend or anyone looking for a job.
good,Good brand to work for. Difficult work environment can have high work expectations often can be a little difficult to balance life with work expectations but very supportive management.
good,"Guess Inc. Is an amazing company, but the business is putting an effect on a lot of employees. Sale Associate doesn't get enough hours, you've to ask for a raise, and most important if your store does well on the day, there is zero recognition."
good,"Super friendly team, easy going environment, no pressure, always room to learn more things, 40-50% discount, great management, super fun job suitable for youths"
good,Teams were great but lacked corporate level structure.  The position I was poached for quickly became less corporate and more in store level. Ultimately it wasn't the right fit.
good,This job was fun and a confidence builder as providing great customer service is the most important. It was a small store so there weren't too many associates and you had one on one time with your client.
good,This job let me in on business. The way to convert customers and use the system to my benefit. We were competitive among each other so I was constantly working towards a goal. I was given man managerial duties which prepped me to learn the aspects of management.
good,"Guess is a really productive and hard working place to work at. The team is the best part of the job. However, the management was not too good. They need to be more organized and on point. Sales level was stressful but at the end of the day it was possible to make target  goals."
good,"Enjoyable place to work, hard-working staff and a friendly environment. I learnt time management, sales techniques and customer service here."
good,"My time spent working for Guess was great, I learned valuable customer experience that i did not know before I started working for Guess. The managers were good at the jobs and awesome with training new employees."
good,"Guess Inc? has taught me a lot in terms of sales, business, and corporate. Great people to work with and I got the chance to experience a large demographic of people."
good,Management was good. Schedule was flexible and coworkers generally didn't abandon ship. Pay was bearable. The work wasn't too hard. The coworkers and managers were nice.
good,"Typical day is busy and productive, there is always something to do."
good,A typical day for me includes helping customers check out and help them with their outfit choices based on preferences. I also help managers audit and count money at the end of the day to make sure sales are all accounted for.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, con algo de desorden pero ayudando a mejorar cada dia."
good,"It' a great store keeping you updated in the latest fashion trends with affordable prices and great, and I mean great, styles and designs."
good,"Una bella azienda, con tante opportunità e potenzialità, ambiente un po' troppo competitivo, nell'accezione negativa del termine: la competizione può muovere un'azienda nel proprio sviluppo, se ha una spinta positiva. Pugnalarsi a vicenda non è una spinta positiva. Per crescere un'azienda necessita di un unico obiettivo verso il quali spingono tutti."
good,"Small shifts, girls are normally good looking and fun to work with and eventually the staff becomes your second family. Manager was amazing ans sweet."
good,fun workplace with a very young personal.The manager was a great person very down to earth and was sharring the task with everybody else.
good,"A typical day at work started with preparing the store , dropping off the deposits as well as morning meetings to discuss our goals for the day. I learned a lot from working at guess, particularly how to be a great sales person as well as how to work in a team environment and encourage my co-workers to do well so we could all reach our goals for the day. In order for our store to succeed it took a group effort. The hardest part of the job was knowing how to encourage a employee who was not as enthusiastic about their job and getting them to reach their goals. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was able to make the clients feel great about themselves and find what they were looking for as well as reaching my personal goals and the store goals."
good,Guess is an ideal place of work for individuals who enjoy working with fashion and the public. Working here also opens up many outlets to other careers in the world of retail.
good,"Inconsistent shoppers during the week"
good,"-Meet your sales goal"
good,"•	Placer des boîtes ; des produits finis et des matériaux d'emballage dans l’entrepôt."
good,"The work environment of the work place is very friendly.  It allows for attitudes and drama to end at the door, and funny people make the hours go by very fast.  Also the customers are very nice."
good,"Le manager m'a beaucoup appris, il y avait une bonne entente au sein de cette entreprise, il n'y a pas vraiment d'aspect négatif si ce n'est qu'il n'est pas facile de vendre une maison"
good,i was just a cashier to efficiently cash them out as well as greet them as they walk in the store and upon leaving as well.
good,"Guess was an amazing opportunity."
good,I enjoyed working at GUESS. Breaks were short but the store was always busy. The hardest part of the job were the late hours and cleanup.
good,Great company to get experience in Merchandising for a big company.
good,"Guess is a wonderful company to work for.  They are very supportive, motivational people.  Some long hours, but mostly there was a good work life balance.  Great co-workers."
good,"Friendly staff, Fast-pace, Customer service. Good experience."
good,overall a fun and eclectic workplace serving great italian fashion.
good,"Guess was a rotation of Customers because it was in an outlet my. typical work day was non-stop, I loved the pace because it was go go go and it kept me on my toes. I learned how to deal with different people from around the world and their needs. My management was beyond awesome and we always had a good time, some co-workers were a little stand offish but we were all able to come together and do our jobs. The hardest part of my Job was having to leave Guess, it was a place I knew I could grow in. I enjoyed it, we were able to dance, sing and make our Guest feel right at home."
good,"This is a good company to work for "
good,"Great starter job that is flexible especially for a college student. A typical day at work is a fast paced environment, with co-workers who are energetic and all for enjoying work. I learned how each person contributes to the overall success of a company, in terms of SPH ( Sales Per Hour) and UPT (Sales Per Transaction) so everyone's effort is important. The management team are considerate and very sales focused. The hardest part of the job is when there is low volume of customers in the store. The most enjoyable part is the atmosphere with co-workers and managers, how well we can work together with the upbeat music in the background (not to mention the 40% employee discount)."
good,Very nice job with normal easy tasks. Learned a lot about fashion that I had not previously known.
good,"restocking, folding clothes, offering service, work under loads of pressure. communicate in the best way possible, very persuasive."
good,"Although the store has individual sales goals for employees, the pay is NOT commission-based. So your base pay will stay the same regardless of meeting your goal for the day."
good,"A retail clothing company that requires tons attention and catering (more than the usual) to customers."
good,I worked in the stock and floor .it was a very good experience for me
good,"A typical day at work is filled with activities that helps both the employer and the employees to grow. I've learnt two management system software so far (PkMS and OMS)."
good,I loved working at Guess? co-workers were friendly and the products are good.
good,"The typical day at work at Guess would be to come in an hour before the doors were open for clients, I would open the store such as, open registers, check sales for the previous day,  get my associate excited for the day and ready to make sales. I was part of the management team and we all worked really well together. I loved being a manager at Guess and would learn new information and tricks throughout the day to help me make the next day better and more exciting. I treated my associates with the most respect and always made sure they were set up for success! The most enjoyable part of my job was to come in everyday to a great team and be able to do what I love to do and that would be give great customer service and make others happy."
good,"Working at Guess by marciano was a great way to get into the fashion world. "
good,"I never dread coming into work even though some days are busier then others. "
good,"Fun place to work"
good,"-customer is always right"
good,"Managers are kind and understanding, modeling environment, good team very nice apparel although not fitted for overweight people just the skinny model type, accessories are overly priced but when they have there sales there very nice"
good,I enjoyed working at Guess just because of the fact that I loved everyone i worked with. All of my co-workers were my friends and we loved working together. 
good,"Responsible for cash register, completed transactions and prepared daily deposits."
good,This workplace was something new for me and it was a good experience. I learned a lot from working in a high class store such as Guess by Marciano and the quality and demand for the clothing items being sold. The team behind Marciano were very intelligent and had a passion for selling and fashion.
good,"Focused staff, motivating management team. A lot of discipline required."
good,"Working in this companies has been a great and wonderful experince, i have learn and grown aswell as thought a couple of my own. I am still anxious to earn even more with this company aswell as with other oppourtunities i can get."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of one to one customer interaction. I did many tasks including sales, administrative work (human resources/operations), visual merchandising and serving customers at the register. I learned a great deal about the importance of customer service, and how to improve my people skills. I also learned the importance of communication when working in a team. In retail, the turnover rate is very high, thus keeping a positive attitude and playing a leadership role contributed to a healthy work environment. My co-workers and managers were very friendly and easy to get along with. My managers were a team of 5 people, each with their own strength. Some were better on the sales floor, while others were better at number crunching. My co-workers were always younger, and new to retail, thus I was also responsible for training new employees, making sure they were up to date with the company's policy & procedures and product knowledge. I was their ""go-to"" co-worker if they had any questions. The most enjoyable part of my job was socializing with customers and the diversity of my job (different tasks). The hardest part of my job was the late night shifts. It was difficult to make it home when I finished my shift at midnight."
good,I learned how to do vmd. (visual management display) Learned the art of selling and many other ways to approach a customer to provide great customer satisfaction.
good,I learned a whole lot in only one day. Gained an understanding of how much work a single day in retail is behind the scenes.
good,"A regular day at Guess goes as followed. We get to work an hour before opening hour , clean up the store. once opened we do some shipment to get the store ready for the customers. Once costumers start entering we give our full attention to them. At Guess its all about the costumer."
good,"As a team member, i make sure to coordinate with my team leader before starting my duties. They taught me to be more focus in sales marketing and a lot more about how to deal with the customer and gain profit from them. The management provide us trainings and seminars about sales, customer mania and personal development to increase self motivation skills."
good,Being employed and bein independant was a great feeling especially being a young lady still at varsity then.I learnt how to communicate and respect co -workers and how to keep customers happy at all times.The management was very proffesional but at the same time they were reachable in terms of us still being able to communicate with them whenever.I enjoyed working with different cultures and assisting customers.dealing with difficult customers though was unbearable sometimes but i had learnt to keep my cool over the years so i learnt to never show my emotions when helping a customer but keep smiling and be assisting.
good,I began working here in June 2007 in sales and by MArch or April of 2008 I became a supervisor
good,"I learned a lot in the 4 years that I worked at Guess. I had a lot of experience in retail throughout the years, but this company put me above and beyond with training me. I transitioned from a part timer to a full time employee with certain responsibilities to ultimately promote me to management. I had a great 4 years there, but I felt it was time for a different atmosphere. With every goodbye, is a new beginning."
good,Its a very intense selling setting especially in the Galleria. You need to be ready to meet very high selling goals.
good,"I would definitely refer a friend to Guess that is looking for a job. Very flexible, coworkers can be friends, easy, and time flys. It doesn’t feel like work sometimes."
good,Good place to work if you're young n willing to work hard and learn new stuff as the company grows. The pay can be good if you know your product and know how its doing
good,what I learned at Guess retail experience and how to be assertive in customer service. while I was working there I gain a great relationship with co workers and was in a great environment. A typical day at  work was great energy and good communication with co workers and customers
good,Working a guess has been a great opportunity to help me become a more social person. The Managers and Associates are all extremely close a genuinely care about you as well as the company  goals. Every one is a young adult and as close as we are there is still much respect for the managers.
good,Not a bad part-time job if you're working another job or in  school looking to make a little money for whatever the reason. There seems to be a bias here or at least my store for some particular reason because I noticed the differences on how some associates are treated in counter to their surrounding peers. The management seems to be a little jealous and it seems like they try every way to make you quit regardless how beneficial you are to the store. Hire new associates and have you train them and then they end up getting more training and hours than you do.
good,This company has good  employee benefits. during the holiday seasons it tends to get hectic. Working during the holidays is how you can secure full time hours.
good,"-everyone is very knowledgeable about current trends"
good,"Help each other out when we are about close store and not done yet in groups we work together faster."
good,Guess was very competitive and very productive working area. Very competitive due to the fact guess is a high-end company.  had to make a certain amount of money every day due to the incomes of the year before on the exact date. Maintaining conversion rates up and be dressed in guess as much as possible. Was not commission based although points were given for additional discounts or prizes
good,"Ho lavorato in questo negozio per pochi mesi come stagista nel periodo scolantico, quindi non era retribuito. Mi sono trovata bene ed era il primo approccio col mondo del lavoro. "
good,Good place to work at if need to work part-time while in school. Depending on the location you work at the people are extremely nice. However it is sometimes stressful during holidays.
good,"Working at GUESS you would come in and put your stuff away and clock in and meet with a manager to see what your task would be for your shift. You have to be fast paced especially if you work at GUESS Factory because we get more shipment."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet new people every day. You have to be able to multi-task. Always have a positive attitude and be committed to your job, have passion."
good,"Overall it was a great experience. I worked my way from seasonal to assistant manager. I got to learn all the parts of the business. Got the opportunity to give customer service to people from all over the world. The majority of the staff was great and fun to work with. I did supply orders. Got to do ecomm orders. Help with inventories. I got to help the store during its remodeling. I dealt with reports on theft and other incidents on the apsis system. I learned quite a bit and grew as well. One thing I did not like was that I only got one raise from when I got promoted to Assistant Manager. Most of superiors of our store/district/region did not really help us too much and felt like they just wanted to get out of Barstow as soon as possible and at times even made fun of the town. What made it to be a strain to go to work and just too stressful on me at home was a certain manager. There were double standards for this manager and always getting away with everything bad and shadey that she did. She did the least of the 3 Assistant Managers and still managed to get promoted to Co-Manager. I got written for being late once and nothing happened to that manager when they lost the store keys for a week.  Like they say it only takes one bad apple to ruin a batch. Once I did leave it put a relief on me. Would I recommend working at Guess?, umm that's hard to say. Every Guess? store I visited outside my store never tried to help me or really talk to me. Plus its a lot of work, I had multiple duties and not that much support. Well with all that yeah I would recommend Guess?. For me it just"
good,"With little said it's a fast pace, competitive, well dressed job. Does not give raises or promotions. Loved the clothes but, just like any other retail job."
good,"Working in Guess was a good experience, the people are good and very nice, You learn lot of work, you encounter a different kind of customer and it was a challenge for you on how you deal with your custulomer, how you assist them or how to make them feel that they are not just a customer but also a family."
good,Guess factory outlets is a very social place. You're constantly  engaging in conversations with customers and employees alike. Plenty of smiles and great music.
good,"It was a great experience working at Guess i love the company, it has made me grow as a person and i would recommend anyone to work and start a career. I have learned many skills that i could use in other jobs now."
good,"First retail job experience. Not a bad place to work with. Company does have a lot of rules and dress code for employee which is normal for a global brand like GUESS. Overall, If you wanna start somewhere,  GUESS is a pretty good choice compare to others."
good,Every workday is the same in and out.  You meet some new people sometimes.  Everyone is friendly including the managers. Hardest part of the job is when corporate visits.
good,"it was along time ago working there but it was good for the time being. high pressure environment, must sell or go home kinda deal "
good,"Overall has good fashion,  cheap prices good quality,  sales associates are great but stressful bosses. I am actually being trained as a lead,  I have great customer service with every guests that walks in.  Hardest part is the bosses but I have learned the ins and outs of a store and what happens."
good,Well it was good pay and the discounts were very good as well. Management could have been a litter better but other than everything was very professional.
good,"lots of room to get work done, really ncie people, but not too much room to move up, and so a change of scenery is needed. Also, as I was only seasonal, I wasn't there long enough to make remarks about higher management."
good,"Would walk into work and be greeted by friendly coworkers, would take 5 minutes to walk around a see new sales or changes in floor sets.  Would then clock in and immediately begin helping customers or my fellow co workers!"
good,Working at Guess taught me how to communicate better with the staff and customers. I made me push myself to work harder to become top seller with the most sales per hour and also become employee of the month. I worked very closely with my coworkers to help style clients.
good,It is a great company to work for. It is not typically busy there and so that affects the employees hours. Sadly many people that work here have to have a second job.
good,"A typical work day would begin with understanding the day's goals, meaning sales goals and sales per hour goals that are assigned individually based on performance. A top seller will be given higher expectations and are expected to meet and even surpass sales goal of the day. I learned the art of selling, patience, building close and quick connections with customers, as well as a sense of urgency. My coworkers were outgoing and not shy, we all built a close relationship and got along very well. The hardest part was getting used to the routine, I wish more could have been done to be kept on my toes. The most enjoyable part of the job was the competitiveness, knowing that if you did not meet your sales goal it could potentially affect hours, as a goal-oriented person I enjoyed always working towards a task, small or of importance."
good,"While it is fun to work at Guess, I think the location I was at could definitely use some improvements. Management was replaced during my time working here, and I think their choice of management could have been better. My manager was a cool person, but I think she needs more experience with managing a store. Also, they hired people who were not reliable which made it hard for others. The hours were low and the compensation wasn't the best, but it's typical retail salary. I just think Guess could afford to make it higher since their clothing is so expensive."
good,My second sales experience was really good. The management team push the salers to do their best. It was a really good work experience and helps e to understand the consumer behavior during the purchase process
good,A typical day at work involved fixing and refolding clothes all day. As well as censoring items and cleaning up the store and helping the customers. I learned how to deal with rude customers. Management was fine there was always one to three mangers on at a time and they were all very nice. My co-workers were also very nice and respected the job. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers because they made the job nice.
good,"I do enjoy working at Marciano, We are all there to serve eachother and each client with the best costumer service. I have learned to stay focus and organize my priorities when there was a hectic environment. The hardest part of being a slaes asscociate would be the hours. At times you have to come in very early or even stay very late depending on the visual aspect of the store. The most enjoyable part of working in Marciano would be being with my coworkers. We all help and encourage eachother."
good,"A typical day at work was me helping customers with their needs, giving them constructive fashion advice. I also helped to maintain a clean work environment and assissted with closing the store. I was able to expand on my social skills as well as my people skills and I was also ale to work as part of a team. My co-workers were very helpful and they were always willing to help out with any assistance required. I believe the hardest part of my job was keeping a positive attitude towards customers that spoke disrespectfully, but I was always able to pull through with a smile and help them as best as I could. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to work as part of such a wonderful team as well as being able to help customers with one of the things that I enjoy and that would be the love for fashion."
good,"I cant say I dislike working for this company. It's fair for the most part....out of all the Guess employees ive met during my time, they are all pleasant and friendly people."
good,"Great sales training , "
good,"sono molto soddisfatta dall'esperienza acquisito presso questa azienda , mi ha insegnato molto ."
good,"its a fun workplace, I cleaned and put tags on the clothing, tapped up boxes,wrote down info"
good,"Lors de mon passage dans la compagnie, j'ai remarqué un climat de tension axé sur les ventes. Bien qu'une saine pression soit indispensable à la bonne réussite de l'entreprise, il faut cependant s'y prendre de manière à encourager l'équipe à se dépasser et ensuite apporter la reconnaissance requise lors du travail bien accompli, aspect souvent négligé."
good,This job was so much fun. I met so many people and the job itself was rewarding.
good,Working at Guess was all about Customer service experience interacting and getting to know about customers needs and stasfying customers. Also had a great management staff that looked after our schedules and worked around our school schedule that made it convienent and comfortable to work. Looking for a better oppurtunity in my field to build a carrer so I thought it was time to look into something in my field that I was in school for.
good,"Guess is filled with hundreds of extremely talented individuals that truly make working at this company worth while. The turnover rate is not as high as most fast fashion companies in the area. A benefit of this is that there are quite a few people who have been with the company for fifteen plus years and hold a wealth of knowledge. Being able to work under them provides great learning opportunities. In general the company policies are more strict than most. You're expected to be on time each morning and you must complete a full 9 hour workday. However, if you respect the companies policies and prove your hard work and dedication there are good people at the company that will take note and show as much appreciation as possible. "
good,I loved working at Guess Inc. The people were positive and always had a fun outgoing personality.
good,"Guess is a fast-paced, dynamic work environment. The people are friendly and the business is competitive. I have learned a lot during my time with Guess."
good,"As a retail store manager you learn alot about general business practices that many that work in an office do not quite understand. On any given day you are leading teams, leading projects, managing P&L's, training and developing your people, recruiting new talent, all while driving sales in an extremely customer-centric environment."
good,A typical day of work consists of helping customers with their overall shopping experience. Working there we were given a goal to meet at the end of each day of sales. To acheive this we promoted in store sales and great merchandise to buy overall. I enjoyed the management at this job. They were very driven and persistant for everyone to do their part at work and their positve attitudes were nice motivation. They made the job fun. The hardest part was making those goals when there were not many customers. Another hard part was keeping the store in decent shape on very busy days and helping mulitple customers at once. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the upbeat coworkers. It was an overall great work environment.
good,"Management daily task include coaching, leading, critical thinking, fast pace and constant new changes"
good,Guess was a great company to work for. If I did not move I would most likely still be employed there. My co-workers were fun to be around and so were the managers.
good,very high volume of customers at Guess but its another good job for students but you have to sell.
good,"Everyone was extremely nice, helpful, and welcoming (including management). I was only there for a month but I can't really complain about anything or anyone."
good,typical day at work consist of a lot of standing. from working at guess i learned a lot of different folding techniques. the hardest part would b cleaning up the discount area but the most enjoyable experience is remodeling the st
good,"I work at the factory version of the store which is primarily in outlet malls. Guess is a very corporate company and it definitely shows. Sales goals for our stores can be unrealistic at times. Outside of that, the hours are extremely flexible. The work can become monotonous at times, especially when working at the fitting rooms. The co-workers are what make it worth while. I got lucky because all of my managers are amazing and so easy to get along with. They don't don't act like they're higher than you. I don't have a single coworker that I don't get along with."
good,"It’s hard to maintain a work/life balance. Working retail you need to work the holidays. Open 364 days a year and it can be stressful when it comes to holidays. Having PTO is good but it’s sometimes difficult to take it because of all the black out dated. Over all the work is easy, lots of work, sometimes fun, but it’s hard to get that work/life balance."
good,L'équipe quand j'y travaillais était très bonne. Certaines journées étaient très stressantes dûes à l'achalandage et d'autres très calmes (surtout dû à la température) mais c'était une belle expérience. Ranger le magasin est long mais on le fait en équipe pour que ça se passe dans la bonne humeur et plus rapidement.
good,"I had worked at many retail jobs prior to Guess but at Guess I felt the most involved. Whether it be revamping displays or organizing the stock-room, your purpose was always realized and appreciated. You can see the effect of your hard work."
good,L’environnement de travail agréable . Il faut être à l’aise avec la pression . Bonne encadrement et l’energie est positive.  Bonne école pour apprendre le métier et possibilité de grandir dans l’entreprise. Par contre la consolidation travail famille n’est pas possible
good,"Opening up the store starts off with sweeping the floors and cleaning the mirrors. After cleaning procedures are done the expectation is to check the Ipad for the Econ orders that need to be sent out to customers with the products in store. Judging by the size of products, three different sized bags are set out to be used with a card from the CEO of the company and products packed up in wrapped paper then sealed with guess triangle stickers. Keeping in mind to separate the tracking order and confirmation/Receipt to be placed inside/outside of shipping bag. After econ is done, finishing the shipment before the store opens at 10 am while remembering to zone the clothing and products to be presentable for customers walking in upon opening. Sometimes mannequins need to be changed by a crucial crunch time given by corporate, then assessed by the picture posted of the mannequins.  usually, weekends are the busiest time while weekdays is a breath of fresh air. Can be chaotic if things aren't done in a timely manner, accordingly, and efficiently."
good,"Great platform to expand whatever sales experience you're looking to capitalize. Allow management a reasonable time frame to observe your work ethic and intentions with the store, which could only open doors for you moving forward."
good,For a company that has been in the retail industry so long they have become to corporate and not driven by making sure that their employees are taken care off but making jus focusing on making the easiest money possible. They have a good internal culture but sometime the work load is not equivalent to the pay.
good,this job is good it's fun I liked it easy and good discounts not bad management in a good area lots of advance opportunities easy kind of work good time
good,"ambiente di lavoro piacevole e stimolante, azienda efficace e interessante con molte iniziative e agevolazioni. La parte più difficile del lavoro è forse quella di tenere sotto controllo più prodotti in diversi reparti. la parte più piacevole del lavoro è quella di aver un ottimo rapporto con il pubblico e con i clienti."
good,good job option for retail compared to my previous ones. have made some close friends during my time here. management is kind of iffy right now but my opinion may be biased because I'm trying to get out of retail
good,"trabajar en guess es una oportunidad laboral importante,ya que te dan la oportunidad de aprender y crecer como profesional."
good,"good work life balance. pleasant place to work, there are some unrealistic expectations from management and not much brand awareness out there so its hard to sell this brand."
good,"Of all the attributes added to my work experience, i think the one I benefit from the most is being exposed to the heart of tourism in miami and  finding a way to make a shopping experience as memorable as I could to vacationers and tourists."
good,"J'apprécie énormément de travailler en tant que vendeuse au seins de votre entreprise "
good,"Guess Factory gave me the opportunity to initiate working in the retail area. I have been learning every day about selling. and marketing. My typical day at work is based on costumer service,  make sure everything is organized, organized the fitting room and push up the conversion of the store. The most enjoyable part of my work is help people to be satisfied with their purchases. Also, the atmosphere of my work is very good. We work as a team and we always help each other. On the other hand, the hardest part is when we have to close the store and we leave very late at night."
good,Компания предоставляет удобный график работы для своих сотрудников. Менеджеры придерживаются пожеланий. Неплохой вариант для учащихся.
good,"Each day would consist of making certain the store was organized to meet the highest expectation of our customers. A sales representative's responsibility was to assist customers with their wardrobe selections."
good,I enjoyed working with he people i worked with. Most people stay with the company because of culture that is created with the people that you are working with.
good,"Un día típico en mi trabajo todos  los lunes hago el horario de la semana me dedico más lo que es trabajo se oficina y los siguientes días vender, full customer service. Hacer la promoción ya que todas las semanas es diferente,  tan pronto llego a mi turno me reportó con el gerente me da las instrucciones si tengo que hacer algo diferente que hayan dado las instrucciones el DM, si no me dedico a mi departamento que es accesorios. Tan pronto termine mis tareas ayudar en los otros departamentos. Lo más que me gusta de mi  trabajo es atender a diferentes personas que lleguen y me digan necesito un outfit para el fin de semana vísteme en ese momento la llevo al probador y le llevó de todo, es muy divertido"
good,"they  had  a  dj  on  the  weekends , which  made  working  there  really  fun. you  only  get  one  break  and  its  not  long  enough. management was very helpful"
good,"Belle équipe et beau magasin."
good,It was a cool place to chill and work at. Different people in and out so gave me a chance to interact with people. It showed me how to work steady and be efficient.
good,"Over the last 2 years has had a lot has changed with the new CEO but overall, it's still a good place to be and they focus on promoting from within but the promotion and raises by merit has dramatically slowed down."
good,"The management and staff got along very well. good company hard working staff, great working ethics, and generous discount. It was a good environment to work in."
good,Enjoyed the company but once start up was over they started looking for positions they could eliminate. The management was all from LA and did not understand doing business in KY
good,Great company with great product. Truly a family company. Lifestyle brand with a array of product. Upper management are very approachable and transparent.
good,"Have the ability to work both independently and teamwork."
good,"A typical day at work was signing in and starting on the floor with folding and fixing clothing, the hardest part of the job would be standing for a lot of hours but it got easier the more you worked"
good,Everyday is different in retail. There is always something that needs to be done. The job requires excellent time management and ability to delegate tasks. Flexibility is required as well as the ability
good,"I loved working here just because your days goes by pretty fast especially on busy days. My coworkers were very nice and easy to get along with. On the other hand, some of the managers was very conniving."
good,"Guess is overall a pretty decent company to work for. When the new CEO came in, the company obviously had a lot of major changes. One of those changes were budget cuts and employees being laid off. "
good,"Ho lavorato in un ambiente sereno , dove ho potuto imparare le dinamiche di produzione."
good,"Jornada de trabajo extensa, es horario de mall. "
good,"-meet hourly/daily/weekly goals"
good,I felt i had great relationships with the management and employees. Not really much security or honesty in the job. I was promised a certain amount of hours on hiring me and getting me to leave my old job and once the holiday season died out my hours went from 45/50 a week to 8 and I had rent to pay at the time. more or less miscommunication.
good,"My typical day at work is very cool, calm, and productive. I have learned many different things while working for this company for example: product knowledge, training fellow associates, and providing great customer service. The management team is excellent because they are reliable and consistent and so are my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is to maintain the fitting room on a busy day. The most enjoyable part of work is basically having fun and provide the best customer experience."
good,"This company made me who I am today. They thought me a lot about business and people. My superiors were excellent, supportive but yet challenged my management skills, which only made me grow into a more knowledgeable/ experienced manager. My favourite part about Guess was working with my customers ( internal and external customers). The hardest part about working for Guess was balancing out my work life and personal life, the job required me to work long hours and always be available to the businesses needs, but when your in love with job I thrived off this."
good,"Great company to work for... Lots of promotions, incentives and raises. Work long hours & late nights to ensure store standards are done before the next business day."
good,"i enjoyed working with the people at guess. Some managers were more enthusiastic but still a wonderful environment. The job was located in the outlets, so i was able to meet others from all over the world."
good,"Maintaining the store is clean at all times and maintaining excellent customer experience to all those that walk into the store. It is a fast paced environment and you always have a task at hand to complete under certain time restrictions. Management is always there to help whenever they are needed, and co-workers are friendly individuals always focusing on teamwork. The hardest part of the job would be ensuring every customer has had an excellent experience as it is hard to reach to each customer at an equal balance as other customers. Working with a team that helps eachother is the most enjoyable part of the job!"
good,"It's a good working environmet, everyone is friendly and great to work with. Helping customers is both enjoyable and hard, it's always a healthy challenge."
good,"I enjoy the atmosphere but the work hours was not enough to learn was would have wanted within the company."
good,"A typical day at Guess all depends on the foot traffic we get that day. If we're busy, everyone works together to identify customers needs and assist them, with the intention of making a great sale. If it's a slow day, usually I would take care of inventory and processing of new shipment. I learned from this job that language barriers do not need to stop people from communication, as there was a majority of our customers who did not speak English, and I always tried to work my way around it to still make a sale. Management was always incredibly helpful in motivating our team, and with scheduling people who really want to work. My co-workers were always bubbly and cheerful, and we always enjoyed working all together on large shipments the one person couldn't handle themselves. The hardest part of the job was honestly just getting to work. Wrentham Massachusetts is not close to home, and I didn't enjoy driving twenty minutes to a half hour to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing familiar customers, because I already knew what they liked, making a sale to them was fun because we weren't complete strangers and they trusted my opinions on new items we had in the store."
good,"Working at Guess Inc. was a very positive experience.  I was lucky to have motivated co workers and managers.  I learned a lot about customer service and sales.  "

good,"Working for Guess as a sales associate is very competitive. You have to beat your Co workers at a sale, make sure that the customers has a good experience and likes you more than the other sales associates."
good,"A typical day at work is fairly stress free, I have learnt how to work as a team and by myself, I have also gained confidence with customers. The hardest part of my job is correcting others mistakes, the most enjoyable is working with some of the best people I have ever met, unfortunately I feel there is more for me to do, especially with my degree."
good,"•a typical day at work: I usedto start at 9-5pm somedays1-10pm, I had to make sure I set up target sales and personal goals"
good,"Typical day at work would include meeting and greeting 500+ customers a day. You must be able to multitask working with customers, working on the register, preventing theft and maintaining the store. Co-workers were great easy to work with helpful and friendly. Management my first 2 years were wonderful the new management towards my resignation were horrible they treated people unfairly and managed hours poorly. Hardest part of the job would be keeping the store maintained from the afternoon until the night when the store is closed but it is manageable as long as everyone stays on task. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people u meet and how you assimilate yourself while working to keep these customers happy and fulfill their wants and needs"
good,"A regular day at Guess would involve setting up and merchandising the product, slow and progressive weekday mornings that would lead into busy fast paced afternoons and evenings. I learned communication skills, styling techniques, and up-selling skills from working at Guess. The hardest part of the job was juggling many different guests at once with clothing options, accessories, and shoes and bags. It was difficult but I learned to manage by multi-tasking and not taking too much on at once. The most enjoyable part of the job was the associates I worked with as well as the benefits."
good,Overall good working environment due to the workers but a lack of management structure
good,Wardrobing customers and making relationships along the way. Having your clients trust in your judgement and fashion sense when choosing the right fit for their outfit. Working with a wonderful team who are all on the same page with how positively get through the work day.
good,"Working for Guess Inc. I've become a better communicator. My typical day at work consists of me being on the floor greeting or behind the cash register. The most enjoyable part of this job is that you make friends and can communicate with them , "
good,Though this was only listed as a temporary employment opportunity
good,I loved what I did while working for GUESS. I started as an assitant project manager whcih then led to an assistan buyer. I finished my last 3 years as a E-commerece Merchandiser which I enjoyed very much. The work enviroment was great and the people were friendly to get along with. I really enjoyed going to work as I got along with everyone. The most enjoyable part of my job was everything! Great people and great enviroment equals happy employee at the end of each day.
good,"En general todo bien, sólo que el salario no es lo suficiente para la vida diaria."
good,they helped me get back into the workforce after having my first bub. great staff and understanding managers. definitely recommend applying if you love a great work life balance.
good,"Ευχάριστο περιβαλλον, φιλικο προσωπικο, ορεξη για δουλεια."
good,"Fast pace, friendly people. It’s an energetic and fun place to work."
good,The people were better than the Company. Even though they have shut down the customers and the environment was lovely enough to petition to stay in business.
good,Worked at Guess for a 1 1/2 and learned so much there and that’s how I built my career in retail. From stock to sales I learned it all. Definitely a unique company to work for if you love fashion. Very friendly environment and you’re not taught to be the type of sales associate to be up everyone’s butt.
good,"Salario acorde a tareas asignadas, requiere ser autodidacta debido a que hay momentos de poca afluencia de público."
good,Worked at Guess for 10 months and gained lots of experience. Co workers and customers were nice Good discounts and benefits. Left to prepare for A level exams.
good,"I started working at guess at a relatively busy time, around September - December it would get really busy, especially since we worked at the top GUESS store in the Sawgrass mall. My main complaint was that the closing method was very strict and sometimes unorganized so I was leaving work at 3AM on some days. besides that the people and environment was very nice and welcoming."
good,co workers made working there worth the while. hated having theme days at work because we were forced to participate and spend money on outfits that we werent going to use ever again. had to wear heels everyday to work was exhausting.
good,"It's definitely a job that if you like competing against your co-workers for favoritism and hours then its a great job for you. "
good,"Retail is Retail... "
good,"A typical day at Guess is having a meeting of our projected goals for the day and the week, being assigned a certain section in the store to maintain, helping out customers and bringing in boxes of clothes from the back."
good,"I enjoyed working here at Guess, it taught me more about how to use sales goals, which can be a big plus when looking at additional jobs. It taught me a mix of independence but also how to work with a great team."
good,Working at guess taught me to step out of my comfort zone and to have more social confidence in myself. It improved my customer service greatly and taught me to work under pressure when helping more then 3 customers at a time.
good,"Fast-paced. You gotta learn quickly to be able to do a great job. Management was okay, seemed like it was based off favoritism but its bearable! Guests come and go and the goal is to sell to them."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and helping them find what they were looking for. A typical day at work was relaxed.
good,"If you're interesting in selling this is a great job.  Its fast paced, competitive, and fun.  Working on Michigan Avenue is a great environment if you're interested in having a serious sales associate position."
good,Working at Guess has been a good experience. Its a good company however is not consistent and you can get stuck in a position for a long time.  the people are great  and the fast pace makes the job fun and productive. You also learn a lot about visual s and product which becomes an exciting part of your job.
good,Challenging but fair. Some things like allocation are off. That's the case with most companies. It's very fast paced but that's what makes the day go by.
good,"Typical day would be opening an closing store and daily task that needs to be completed such as stock. Making sure team is generating projected hourly goals contributing to total target and comp numbers"
good,I became a great leader working with a Guess. Leadership was a huge focus that I appreciated.  They encourage training and development to avoid complacency. There’s always a new challenge.
good,"Trabajo junto a personas, que aunque jóvenes, han tenido la experiencia necesaria para enseñarme a desenvolverme con fluidez y garantía para la empresa, de rápida adaptación por parte personal. Contacto estrecho y cercano con la persona encargada de la tienda."
good,"Its a grind. Learned a lot about the industry working here, but it seems most supervisors are afraid to see their employees flourish. Glass ceiling for everyone."
good,"It's a total fashionable brand. We use to target the core customer service,and most important thing is thrice in a year there is staff tour.we loved it."
good,"Management team and coworkers really make you feel like family. Flexible hours, productive, energetic days and a welcoming atmosphere to come work in. Very friendly and helpful managers willing to show you how to approach any task you struggle with. Very organized environment and a lot of positivity to give."
good,This company has a great work environment based on the co-workers always welcoming new people. The company is great for working in the fashion industry. This company has been around for a long time and have been very successful. The management only expects excellence and will point out all your mistakes and does not appreciate when work is done correctly. (This is based on NYC office)
good,"If you love fashion, Guess is the store to be at. They are innovative and driven. The district I've been apart from were help you grow and develop to your desired goals."
good,"Since I am a part time, I do not receive the same benefits a full time worker receives. I enjoy working in Guess, our location attracts a lot of tourists so I would say the best part about working there is the people I get to meet, and hearing a variety of different stories. The hardest part about the job is getting to school from work. I work in Manhattan and attend Queens College, so it would take me about two hours to travel from work to school. I have learned a lot being in such a small store, I got to do a lot of things I did not get to do in Aeropostale."
good,"As a manager, I loved working here. They had standards but were open to and listened to one's opinion. Every store has a different customer market and this company was aware of that. They made adjustments while still sticking to policies and procedures. I learned many things while being a manager here. It was a pleasant work environment."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of touching up the store before opening, work our specific job position we were assigned that shift with a one hour break in between, and spending most of our time assisting customers. Working at this job, I have learned how to problem solve on my own, work efficiently, and improved my customer service abilities. The GUESS? Factory workplace culture in he Queensborough Landing location is very friendly and supporting. Everyone, including management, feels comfortable sharing personal information since there is a strong sense of trust and loyalty among the work group.The hardest part of the job is not always being able to solve the problems our customers present to us. The most enjoyable part is spending time with a team I love being apart of and watching customers leave the store satisfied with our service."
good,"A regular day was full of smiles, fashion clothes and great coworkers who make the job seem really fun. Selling and promoting every new piece of cloths, making every customer happy and interacting with every customer that comes in to the store."
good,"Guess was a great place to learn the logistics and how-to's of working in retail. The people were great and open to help me when I needed it. However, something that was not so great was the hours they gave their employees. Even though I was a seasonal worker, my schedule would sometimes change without me being informed first. This would cause confusion with my hours. Otherwise, Guess was a great place to work out."
good,Working at GUESS? was an amazing experience especially the way they make you feel at home. I've learned how to work with different customers and giving off sales. The hardest part is working with difficult customers and finding exactly their style when they don't know it. The best part of he job is satisfying customers and meeting the team set goal for that day.
good,"L'environnement de travail est agréable, belle complicité avec l'équipe de Guess"
good,"Working for Guess was a pretty simple job. You come in dressed your best, sell your best, and go home.I really enjoyed the time there and the benefits such as 40-50 percent off for employees and bonuses at the end of the pay period. The management wasn't my favorite. They cared little for the employees. If you like to be fashion forward and interact with visitors this is your job."
good,"Its a great place, sometimes hard to get time off, always something to do. Never a day to just sale always multi tasking. hours are either great or a what the heck kind of situation."
good,"I had a great time working here for the most part. I had a manager that I didn't see eye to eye with and would tend to get into constant passive aggressive disputes to the point that I'd ask my general manager to shift our shifts around so that she and I would no longer have shifts together. Aside form that, working at Marciano was great. One of my managers, to this day, are still one of my closest friends who I happen to see quite often. It was a great first job and I was also able to build a strong clientele. Unfortnately, during this time, I had to quit in order  to focus more on my studies."
good,"I have learned a lot about the job and the training was great, Management very skilled and professional,but I found that there was no  work/life balance"
good,"I learned many things working in guess right from the standards the company follows, techniques to dress a typical customer for different occasions and also selling techniques as well which helped me to achieve overall growth"
good,Management team is helpful and very motivational. Great ability to grow and move up in the company. Co-workers are friendly and work well as a sales team.
good,A typical day at work includes many negative and positive elements that take place differently day to day.There are specific duties and tasks that need to be completed daily during each shift.
good,"The workers are very friendly, everyone works together well and motivate everyone to create a great shopping experience. The hardest part sometimes is getting sales, not everyone is looking to buy, some are merely looking to pass time so meeting your daily quota can be a bit difficult at times."
good,Great positive work place.  Management team was easily available to talk to.  Work life balance was not a problem.  Not much benefits besides store discount.
good,Although i only worked here for a few months i enjoyed every single time i worked there. You are in a fun environment and great managers!
good,"Great place to work part-time whilst Studying. Great ability to sell and handle all of clients needs, desires, and problems."
good,"the job was fun and the co-workers were amazing but even after working there for over a year my pay did not increase due to ""pay freeze."" overall, great people and good for student work but flexibility isn't so great"
good,"Working at Guess was all about pompt and etiquette. As long as I kept everything in order, my workflow was smooth and stress-less. The pace would speed up around the Holidays but we were trained to handle these rushes without disrupting the natural order of the store. I received extensive knowledge on different styles and fashions  as well as how to put signature pieces together for a look that the customer can appreciate, this was the most enjoyable part of my job. The mangement was the best that I've been under so far, they were just as involved and showed me everything I needed to know to get the job done well."
good,Fun fast paced environment. following the fashion trends for men and women. Accessories and shoes are a top seller. very clean neat and well organized
good,"Helping customers with their selection of clothing."
good,"Guess Chinook has an outstanding management team that truly care about their employees, and store operations. It is a fun and friendly place to be employed."
good,"Competitve, Customer comes 1st. Co workers are all nice and are good teammates . the most enjoyable part of the job is closing sales"
good,A typical day at work was coming in around two in the afternoon dealing with various and diverse clients and trying to accommodate them best possible. Finding out their needs and what suited them best for their benefit. Getting along with my co workers wasn't an obstacle we worked as a team to accomplish our goals everyday! The hardest part about being a fellow member of GUESS INC. was dealing with customers who weren't so cooperative but that was the most enjoyable thing about it. Turn a negative into a positive and accommodate the client and give them the experience they wish. Then it would come to my closing shift which was from two to eleven pm and i would have to close down the registers meaning count the money and make sure everything was correct and put it in the safe; and basically clean up the stores by making everything neat and ready for business for the following day.
good,"It was fun to work with all those nice clothes, I loved that part. The hardest thing was to approach the customers -we had to sell lots of clothes!- because I used to be shy and I think that made me grow up. It also was my first time as a cashier but I had few responsibilities and I was not too under pressure."
good,"The management and personnel were all very friendly and welcoming from the time I started and to the time that I had left.  Like in any other clothing store, it was certainly a job monotony, but remained important in that we had to keep a neat, and efficiently accessible store for our customers to shop in."
good,"this company is all about sales with no commission. The managers are awesome, hardest part is getting people to buy what they didn't come into the store for, and pushing sales on people. the most enjoy enjoyable part was actually helping people find that right outfit for their occassion"
good,The work load was never too much to ask in the amount of time you had to finish it. The managers were all young and fun. My co-workers were all college kids looking for part time work.
good,It worked her while completing my Masters degree. It was a great place to work. I have amazing supervisors and the atmosphere was always fun. It was like a big party everytime I worked.
good,"The typical day at work would be, arriving on time, check the inventory and make sure all the new products are on shelfs. Ive learned how to be organized, learned new customer service skills and how to handle angry customers. My cow-workers were cool and sometimes noisy."
good,It's perfect for a college student needing to make money while attending school. The location I work at is really like a giant family.
good,"I love working for Guess! I've had the opportunity to work for and with some of the most inspiring people I've ever met. It's a large company with a small family feel and I felt challenged, motivated and that I was valued each and every day."
good,"I enjoyed working with the merchandise and displays.They have lovely things. However that particular location was very unorganized and the pay was minimum wage, so I had to leave for a higher paying position."
good,"Guess is another great place to work,  you are able to meet lots of different people. Everyday is different and the people you work with become your family."
good,"love this company great atmosphere."
good,"open/close store, help customers, process shipment. Best part was the staff, product, and helping customers.Worst part the district manager."
good,"•Beverly Center, Second highest Sales Volume Store in California"
good,"Se trabajaba muy a gusto, aprendi a gestionar la caja, la encargada super competente, muy amable. Las compañeras simpre dispuestas ha ayudar, no habia nada dificil,lo unico que el almacén erá pequeño y para colocar la mercancia habia que liar mucho jaleo. Ambiente de trabajo muy cordial, muy buen rollo y todas hibamos a una."
good,I was with the company for almost 3 years i loved it my store manager was awsome I was with the same empolyes the whole time i was there my co worker were like my second family i enjoyed going to work everyday i got a raise for each year i was there. unforently my they could not make me a manager and my store location had closed down
good,Guess was my first job in retail. I enjoyed the experience as it introduced me to sales and was flexible with my college schedule. I also was a top sales performer and assisted in inventory processing and floor sets.
good,"A typical day at Guess was greeting customers, talking with them to see what they are looking for and offering to hold their items in the fitting room or at the front of the store when they were ready to make a purchase."
good,The store I worked at had a lot of fun people to work with. I was a sales associate. The pay was not that great but it never really is for these kinds of jobs.
good,"Retail experience was a fun to learn job, teaches me to be patient with different customers, management is good, the culture was fun, and the hard job is inventory, on a typical day at Guess is usual slow-paced but also enjoyable."
good,To me nothing  stands out except  well that its really  far for me wich is the reason  i didn't  accept the job offer  over all great environment and place to be as a custumer
good,Fun and relaxed workplace environment with easy-going management. Everyday presents a new challenge in terms work load. Employees are encouraged to take risks and come up with new and innovative ideas to increase business growth.
good,Best DM and co workers.. love it ... It feels like home.. very caring and great team work. Will recommend everyone to work here. Challenging but a great work enviroment.
good,Secondo il mio punto di vista la ritengo un'azienda molto valida poichè mi hanno trasmesso una formazione completa.

good,Çok güzel ve sıcak bir ortam insan ilişkilerini geliştiren bir iş
good,"The experience to work in guess in one word is : PASSION, you need to feel you need to love the trend, the Fashion world, is an fun enviroment to work ."
good,"It is a very fun job,  I had a wonderful time working there but it is not a job that you can live by without stressing unless you become more than just an employee."
good,Es una empresa donde te brinda conocimientos y aprendizaje para la atención personalizada al cliente
good,"The environment was great, the job and payment were good and great team work too. The tasks relatedd with the job, they were explained properly and clear."
good,being brought into a top door store gave me the ability to work and manage at a high pace. the product line is fun and locked into today's young sexy culture.
good,Guess Factory always intends on carrying a great vibe amongst employees so as to rub off on customers. Working there had it’s ups and downs but overall the environment was great.
good,"You have to fight for your hours. In a way, helps if you are competitive. They rated on how many sales you made for them to understand if they should ""keep"" you. Great environment though."
good,Beware of black friday. Always got intense on this day. Customers coming in at all times lol it was crazy. But great store with amazin clothes. Discount is great. Hours arent too shabby either. You’ll learn a lot about denim jeans here.
good,"What you learned: Confidence"
good,Managers are great. Hours are flexible and it’s relaxed environment to work in. The day goes fast especially when you have things to do. Winter is slow but hours pick up after February.
good,"2012 Guess was the best. They invested in people they believed in and I was one of them. As the years went by, the company made many changes including a new CEO and the company started going down hill. In 2015, They closed about 70 stores and mine was one the them. Instead of transferring my team to the other stores who were hiring, they laid us all off. I planned on working for Guess for years to come."
good,"Keeping the department clean, arranging clothes, managing changing rooms, working as a cashier were my daily tasks."
good,Managed sales department by developing and ensuring completion of internal sales daily. Visual updates to ensure unique presentations.  The most enjoyable part of the job was providing exceptional customer service and interacting with customers. The hardest part of the job was the challenge of converting returns into exchanges.
good,I worked at the GUESS? Distribution center in the office as an HR Intern during school breaks. My manager was excellent and it was really great to get the experience in HR. Very laid back and positive environment.
good,"While working at Guess you learn to expand your social skills, become more productive, and to have drive and initiative. It's a great first job to build your skills for future careers."
good,Few managers a lot of associates so few hours. Smooth and relaxed but productive. Minimum wage. Dress code isn't problematic. Clean. Good customer care and service. Friendly co workers no drama.
good,fun but high stress. great clothes but company is hurting and making chANGES. focussing more on visual standards and less on customer service. price points still too high without the same quality.
good,"Working at cash, giving people change, answering the phone, greeting people"
good,High paced environment. Very diverse group of associates. Work based on incoming orfders. Some voluntary time off during slow periods. No real compensation increases 2016 and 2017.
good,"Its a very sanitary, healthy environment to be in. However management is a tad bit peculiar when it comes to doing their jobs; doesnt seem as if theyre always prepared like they should but other than that their pay rate is fair depending on the position you have and time period of being there."
good,Great place to work just no room for advancement. To advance my career opportunity to move forward in my career for a better way of life. I need more in my life. I feel that Guess has no  more to offer me for my career life.
good,"The daily tasks that were required for this job were repositioning go backs, presenting great customer service, and assisting customers. I learned how to solve problems quicker and more efficiently. The management team at this location did the best that they can, they each brought positive attributes to the establishment, however their communication skills lacked amongst themselves and with ALL employees. The hardest part of this job was closing, due to the fact that we had to clean the entire store no matter how long it took. The most enjoyable part for me was the employee discounts!"
good,If your looking for a challenge. This company is for you. You need to be able to adapt quickly to change and catch every curve ball the company throws at you. The culture and people are great. Upper management could be a little more organized and compensation could be better but other than that the benefits of working with the company are great.
good,"A livello lavorativo mi sono trovata bene sia come ambiente di lavoro, sia nei rapporti con clienti e colleghi."
good,"Good environment, healthy place to learn. All of the co-workers were nice and interesting people, definitely helped me grow as a person and experience something new."
good,We had to reach our sales goal and help clients satisfy their needs and learn the products on our sales floor in order to successfully find what our clients were looking for.
good,"Prior to leaving the company, the management, and those at head office assured the staff that the store would not close. Less than a month after my departure the staff was told that the store would be closing by the end of the month, with only one staff member offered a transfer, and that staff member was not in a management position. While my time there taught me a lot about retail and management there was no job security, because those at head office did not value their employees."
good,we'll it was a good organisation to work with very rich working culture.my co workers are good natured and very helpful to get things to done and learn. we salery wise growth was slow.most enjoyable part of the job customer intrection and fun loving atmosphere of job pace.
good,"Working here was a great experience the security was great the management was great and the crew members were also great. And I say great I mean everyone works together and communication was there, my management understood if I was late and they also helped me when I needed to go to school and with my personal life. The benefits were great the money was great as well. I would have stayed but seasonal ended and I guess I did not qualify enough due to me being a college student."
good,"It was a great place to work but I needed more hours, and the days went by quickly and sometimes there were some customers that were difficult."
good,"In relation to working at guess,a typical work day would consist of morning meetings, about accomplishing sale goals for the day, after the morning meeting, we would then focus on the customers and try to sale the merchandise. once the middle of the day hits the manager would then tell use over a walkie talkie how much we sold, and how everyone is doing with in the day. after that we have our break for lunch, after lunch we remain working until closing, "
good,Over the past few months management has changed due to managers either leaving the company or being let go. These changes occurred during important holidays as well as operations such as floor moves which required managers from other stores to come in and assist during those times. I had to continuously work under new management and learn to work under a new style about every two weeks.
good,"greeting and helping customers, balancing with customer service and do cash. I learnt about dealing with all types of customers and keeping a smile on my fave with whatever the situation may be and how to deal with it alone or if it requires management then involve them. Great experience but don't receive proper shifts."
good,"It is nice to advice people what suits them the best so they look better and as a result more confident. All employees were sincere and professional giving that advice. In addition, they have a great taste and able to give an examples of different styles."
good,GUESS has a great energy about it. very easy to make numbers and is a good starter job to help you further advance in the retail industry.
good,Weekends are very busy which helps when you work a 9 hour shift.  Can feel a but difficult to be part of the team when you first start however as time goes on people do open up and are friendly. If you like a fast paced job this would be an ideal place to work.
good,"A normal workday involves preparing the store for the customers that will be walking in. There is a lot of stock work involved (multiple sizes and colors) to ensure that the customer can always find what they are looking for. Selling to a customer involved choosing outfits that would match their original choice of clothing. Even clientele could be acquired if the employee was so inclined. What I took away from this job is that as a sales associate your main goal is to provide the customer with great looking clothes. The management is usually very relaxed and forgiving, but as it is a sales position (no commission) they might push you to sell more that you feel you may be able to. The coworkers can vary, there are plenty of nice coworkers but there are also a few that tend to stir up trouble, as with any job really. The hardest part of the job is pushing for more sales, it can feel like a daunting task sometimes. The most enjoyable days of mine was when I managed to surpass my own sales records."
good,"Worked on sales of clothing, purses, jewelry and shoes. Warehouse of the store, inventory and distribution of goods. I learned more about sales and costumer service. Management was very supportive and helpful. The co-workers were very focused on sales. The hardest part was to make sales to foreigner with a language barrier but It was  the most enjoyable too."
good,"Guess is a nice shop, the clothes is very very beautiful but a lot of expensive. The best product is a denim thoursers or your bags. The partners are often a little obstinate for the competitive."
good,"I simply loved everything about the atmosphere! The customers, associates and managers were always happy and supportive. Training was on par and all needs of the workers and customers were met. The lunch breaks were rewarding as well as the monthly worker benefits."
good,"A typical day at work would be to greet a customer,  let them have a look around,give a few minutes reassure that the customers are fine, ask if they need any help/ guidance. Pick an outfit if been asked. Stay at fitting rooms at some times, deal with the purchases at the tills. Help customers with footwear, jewelry, watches etc. "
good,"Asssistant Manager; responsible for overseeing the customer experience, training and development of the store staff, leading by example on the selling floor and maintaining the store standards on the selling floor and stockroom. "

I love engaging with people an communicate with them. to be a part of the guess community being able to be social is very important, because helping our co workers an all the customers is key to running a great business.

All in all its a vert interesting job."
good,Enjoyed my time working for GUESS! Loved the people who I had the opportunity to work with. Lots of great opportunities to desire and accomplished.
good,"i worked there for a short period of time. even though it was temp . i would of loved to be hired on permently. A typical day at work was the same routine unless there was no work at the station i was assigned. i learned how to work certain machines and i also learned the process on how clothes and shoes was packed and shipped off. My managers were likable, they were easy to talk to but also stood their position as manager. My co workers were not that bad. it took some getting use to diffrent personalities because we worked so closely but i always handle in situation with a positive mind-frame. the hardest part of this job was the consistent change. nothing was permanent so when i got comfortable where i was stationed, i was always moved where i was needed. no matter what. i would say the work atmosphere, meeting new people, learning new things and the weekly pay."
good,"I enjoyed Guess a lot. One thing i learned was how to meet my sale goals for the day and another thing is how to understand Portuguese. My co-workers were catty but i mean thats all girls lol, and the management was very put together. The hardest part of my job was cleaning up after the people and the most enjoyable part was dressing cute everyday for work."

good,"We are always able to get tasks completed on or before time while still having fun and enjoying work. "
good,I was able to move up in this company which allowed me to work in and learn about corporate America.
good,Guess is a great company to work for. They are constantly training and developing their staff on a regular basis.
good,There was never a typical work day. each day was something new and filled with learning. The hardeast part was leaving the job and team.
good,"Business structure and expectations clearly expressed. "
good,I truly enjoyed this job. Learned so much and loved the management team.
good,"A typical day of work if filled with many shores and new challenges. It's fun and you always seek a new way to sell and accomplished your daily goals. Being the only Guess in Marciano in Puerto Rico we have a very specific group of customers who we have to go above and beyond for them. The company requires to always look your best, dress to sell. The management team is amazing and always look for opportunities to grow as a team and to keep the store up to date. The hardest part of the job is finding out what the client wants or what she doesn't like, but that as well is the most enjoyable because you get to interact and learn a little more about the client."

Ensured that all new hire paperwork were 100% up to date and that training guidelines were met. Conducted weekly Loss prevention audits and reported any known shortage. Conducted weekly group interviews and monthly orientations. Ensured the business remained steady and completed at least 4 hours of customer service experience through floor supervision. I had great co-managers and support system at work.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the opportunity to connect with people on a daily basis.
good,"Energetic work enviroment."
good,"I started off as a sales associate and was promoted to assistant manager within the first year. I've been with this company for 3 years. My role was to train new coming employees, deal with returns and deposits, opening and closing the store, paper work, and basically managing the store when the manager is not around. "
good,"its retail. hours suck, pay isnt great, health benefits are actually decent if youre fulltime. people suck"
good,Everyday I attend work I look at it as a new opportunity to meet new clients and develop more professionals relationships. I enjoy delivering a service that puts a smile on a clients face by the time they walk out of the store. I have learned a great deal with work with all kinds of different management styles. The working environment is high energy and highly competitive. The hardest part of the is the days our numbers are not met. I set the bar for higher expectations for myself and my team.
good,"Working in Guess Inc. I had a seasonal position which made my work performance stronger because I knew that in order to keep the job I had to show the managing staff that I could be a good asset to the company. A typical day at Guess would be full of energy,very fast paced, what I liked most is that they had a live DJ in the store which made the store more attractive to the customers. Guess Inc. was my first retail job where I learned how to help more than one customer at a time. The co-workers and management was very friendly and easy to bond with which made me eager to come to work. The hardest part of the job was getting used to approaching people and breaking the nervous feeling, but in time I've gotten better at it."
good,"Executing the merchandising/buying plans for the manufacturing and /or importing of product through various means, including counter sourcing imports or tag on production with Guess? L.A. or complete package F.O.B. Canadian goods."

good,"On a typical day at work I open and close the registers, inventory our product, maintain the cleanliness of the store and customer service."
good,"Enjoyable part of the job would be working with visuals, which get updated every 3weeks to a month, or during a specific promotion (i love merchandising)"
good,A very high class and glamorous place to work. I primarely learned everything i know about management in retail from Guess. Management in this company is constantly coaching the staff and helping them to become better workers. They are kind and flexible and always celebrating your success and acheivements. Co-workers were always coming to work with a smile on their face. The dissapointing part about the job was not getting enough hours and not much room to advance in the company. The most enjoyable part about the job was feeling very appreciated and working in a very high standard environment.
good,Guess is a great company overall and truly cares about its employees.
good,Great company to work for especially when dealing with customers. My team always leaves a great impression on our customer base to return and ships with us. Looking for room for advancement since I just graduated.
good,"Greet costumers, make sales percentages meet, fold clothes and work as a cashier."
good,"Working at Guess has its ups and downs. The in store managers are usually really good, the regional managers and head office staff for Canada are often tough even though they are friendly it’s a different feel. Working every position there but management gives a the benefit of knowing how retail works from the back house to the front. Stock is where 90% of the work is done then sales and cashiers."
good,"Overseeing appointed division, making sure collection is on point, deliveries and sales are on track. Contacting customer and making sure all requirements are meet."
good,"Guess is an amazing company to work for , it has a lot of room to grow you must be a fast learner and willing to push yourself showing why you are the best. they have lost of fun activities."

good,If you like competition this is the place. The sales are the number one priority. They are a very fashion forward company. So you always have to look your best.
good,"L écoute et la formation sont des mots clés pour cette entreprise. Sans doute le meilleur emploi que j ai pu avoir, une hiérarchie à l écoute des besoins et des recommandations. Une formation quotidienne et un désir permanent de se lever pour aller travailler dans la sérénité et la confiance."
good,Working in a corporate company was a an opportunity for me to re-direct my career from Caregiver to an Office Employee. Grateful for this Company who gave me a chance to grow and learn new skills and gave the best of myself to add contribution to their company.
good,The work culture is excellent but the pay is not that great. If you are a manager you don't have to worry about hours but if you are a sales associate then hours can change every week. I loved my team and had a great experience while there. There is opportunity in the company but sometimes it takes a very long time to get a promotion. The benefits are great as well and they have a good 401k plan.
good,"•	Scanner les articles "
good,I thought that this was a convenient job to have when you are in school. I was seasonal so the team was very nice and flexible with hours. I don't have anything negative to say about it.

good,"The staff here really value chemistry when picking team members. As a result, the training process was seamless and overall I really enjoyed my stay. I would definitely recommend to others if you are looking for a place that values you as a person, not just an employee."
good,a great place to learn face to face sales in a situation and among different cultures and language barrier. plenty of incentives and the people are great and friendly.
good,"Um dia típico no trabalho é agradável, com algum trabalho, porém o tempo passa rápido."
good,Working was great loved the people and managers and had lots of opportunity to grow. hours come to those who work hard and have different variation of skills. low pay due to no raise unless promoted.
good,This shaped me in to being a workaholic. There were a few challenges but I rose above them with ease. I enjoyed interacting with the customers and making great sales
good,"Maybe this was just my experience working in NY on 5th avenue, but it can be very competitive against yourself as well as your coworkers to better your sales, and to look the best/sell the best. They are a bit more traditional(sexist) about dress code (i.e. heels and makeup but guys can pretty much wear whatever) but overall it was an interesting environment to work in, and I learned a low about more upscale selling."
good,"Guess: work style not too easy,you have to be careful all single one you did,check correctly job came out before sent to next step or department to follow up."
good,"very busy day always had something to do always learning something new"

good,I enjoyed working at Guess upper management was very positive and always was helpful to help you advance in your career. The most important thing I learned at Guess was how to run a bigger team on the sales floor.
good,"Factory Outlet store greet customer, prepare clothes in a presentable manor, sale customers on new products, stock back room, check out customers, and handle returns."
good,"Well balanced work. I learned a lot about sales during my time there, it was a very enlightening experience. The only gripe I had is that they only hire seasonal."

good,"Had the pleasure to work for both Guess Clothing outlet and the Guess Accessories store and the experience was great. I learned to step out of my comfort zone and approach random people to serve them in purchasing products for the company.Having always had a desire for arts and fashion, I enjoyed retail."
good,Great place to learn and grow. Lots of advancement  potential. They take the time to train and develop you accordingly to make sure you are set up for success.
good,everyone was welcoming and hard workers.Learned a lot from them and made things easier for me on my next job. my manager at that time was marvelous and helped me be one of the top sale representatives in the store. I felt accomplished
good,"I enjoyed the experience positive environment, I would help people with their purchases, I have learned to communicate better with people. the culture is somewhat diverse!"

good,Guess offered plenty of opportunities as well as competitive pay. It was a fun and energetic place to work along side some amazing employees. I would recommend this job to any friend.
good,"As a member of management, we were salary exempt, meaning that if someone called in and they needed someone to cover, you got to cover without additional pay.  The theft level was insane at the outlet location."

good,working for guess was a great experience. I would recommend this job to anyone. It is a phenomenal company that allows growth a d improvement. I once again would recommend this job to anyone.
good,"great working for guess. Hours not always given . management was great. factory does get super busy and being a main cashier is even busier. fun place , they events at times which was great to be a part of and the fun contest ."
good,"Working at Guess was always unpredictable. Being a sales associate consisted of duties such as assisting customers, stocking, cashiering, and cleaning. My duties of the day varied, but I mainly assisted customers and made sales to reach the sale goal of the day.The employees and managers were friendly which often made it a fun workplace. On the other hand, I needed to work more hours and they were unable to fulfill my needs at that time."
good,The only problem I have is that they say one thing but do other things. They told me that we couldn't change to another shift unless we were there for a year. But they let this one woman do it and she was there less time than me. they said that it was temporary but she has been temporary in weekend shift for a year now. Than they said that we were getting a raise but that fell through. People are working more than the shifts they have.
good,Fun bubbly people. its important to have high energy and be competitive with your sales. they are aggressive sales people. have fun work your butt off and expect low pay.
good,"Always come to work with a new and stylish outfit to inspire customers. The customers always love to have feedback on new items, so always have product knowledge."
good,Ambiente cerano y divertido. Buen trato con los compañeros.
good,"The coworkers and fun and caring, most of the management team is understanding and amazing to be around, they inspure and help through rough times and help with any improvements needed in a polite and professional manner."
good,"At Guess Accessories I learned how to do stock, refill the floor, back stock the excess items on the floor , and how to operate the cash register. It was a fast paced environment that made work hard to ensure I learned quick. The management was very understanding when I had to report into the national guard even when I had to miss out on training days. "
good,"Устраивалась работать продавцом консультантом с графиком 5/2. В связи с тем, что я училась, компания подстроилась под меня и я работала столько времени, сколько я могла отработать (учебе вообще не мешала моя работа).  Единственный минус, не было место, где можно в обеденный перерыв покушать и отдохнуть."
good,"Guess Factory at the Outlet Shoppes of El Paso was a great place to work at. The manager at the time was very understanding and friendly. The people who were employed with me at the time were helpful when I asked questions where things were. It wasn't too hectic except on Black Friday of course. "
good,"The day consists of assisting the customers as soon as they walk into the store. We tell them about our promotions and new articles. If they require no further help we proceed to maintain a clean store by continuously tasking around the store. "
good,"I only worked there for about a month and a half, but my time there was mostly enjoyable. The only thing I can complain about is that most of my coworkers had their own little clique and were kinda hostile, but I'm sure they had their reasons as my mind wasn't totally all there while I was employed. Overall, it was an okay experience. I hold no ill will toward anyone there."
good,I really enjoyed working with this company. Management was Great and so was the working environment. I would definitely recommend this company for any one pursuing a job as a car details man.
good,"I have this job for almost nine years; it was steady and a very friendly environment for a working student.  In this work, I started with six dollars per hour and ended with eight with seventy-five per hour; this means growth but at a slow pace. The management was excellent with their workers, but because they were the ones that get all the prices and mentions by the company. In the aspect of merits, there was a great despair with those workers vs. the management. Overall, it is good for someone age 18 to 24 to get a little money and study at the same time."
good,"Une très bonne ambiance générale dans la boutique et entre les collaborateurs."
good,When working as a Sales Associate i did work off a great commission based program until it was disrupted which prompted me to leave the company. Other than that i have nothing but good things to say about Guess.
good,"A typical day often consists of maintaining the store environment so that its a pleasant experience for customers by managing many employees simultaneously. Work sometimes begins fairly early in the morning, often before opening hours, and an 8- to 10-hour workday begins.  I handle a wide variety of routine tasks, such as writing reports; supervising employees; managing cash; ordering stock; handling schedules, payroll, and marketing and promotional roll-outs; and securing the store upon closing. In addition, I can expect to deal with customer complaints, employee work delegation, staff shortages, equipment failures and other unexpected things that occur in a retail environment."

good,"We have a different number of target that we must meet everyday. I've learned so much in my experience at guess.

It took time to understand, but it did become easier along the way. Moving to management, the four if them are very goal oriented and keeps everyone's energy up! The co-workers have a great sense of problem solving and teamwork skills. Working at Guess Factory only becomes difficult when trying to assist in breaking the language barrier. This store has a very internationally diverse group of loyal shoppers and it really helps having team members that are fluent in two languages. The absolute best part about working at Guess Factory is the teamwork and loyalty the co-workers have for one another. Each year Guess Factory changes up their staff and the ones who have been there the most really welcome all new comers and managers. Great place, great hours, and best of all great management!"

This is also when supervisors tell us who will be working in each part of the sales floor. I learned about different fashion trends, and how to sell add-ons.

good,Start the day organizing the floor
good,"Typically you come in for your shift and go to the front to find out your sales goal and section you'll be in. Then you get straight to helping out customers. It's a great place to work because management is always there in case you need something and all of the co-workers are willing to lend a helping hand. It's a really cool, modern, upbeat environment which makes it fun, but sometimes depending on where you are in the store, your sales goal may not get reached.

Although, hours DO SUCK, it helps me maintain a good balance with school. Coworkers are pretty chill; everyone is around the same age. The only thing I don’t like is the folding part of the job especially in the kids section."

good,"A great location on 5th ave New York City. A goal driven aggressive sales environment from associate and managers. $30,000 sales days every Friday and Saturday are the norms. $20,000 every other day however if we don't meet or exceed goals we stay open feels like being hostages at times. Long closing nights sometimes due to the lack of associates closing or inexperienced associates. Motivate me to succeed in life and move up in the company.Cut hours when it's a slow day and for someone who lives on their own that is not ideal."
good,"I enjoyed working at Guess. It was fun & I learned a lot about clothing, shoes, jewelry, handbags & how running a clothing store is not as easy as it seems.

good,"As a Co-Manager I worked directly beside the Store Manager in day to day operations. He was a great Mentor and taught me a great deal.

good,A typical day at work would include helping a large amount of customers during the holiday season folding and putting clothes back where it belongs . I've learned a great deal of  customer service and multi-tasking skills. Management there is very helpful and understandable. Co-workers were very warming and friendly and everyone helped everyone out. The hardest part of the day would have to be closing when trying to fix everything and helping customers so that we were able to close the store. The most enjoyable part would have to be interacting with all different kinds of people and learning a little about each and everyone of them even if it was just  their sense of style.

good,"Working at Guess was an enjoyable experience.  During my day I interacted with customers; assisting them so that Guess clothing stood about as an exceptional store.  While working at Guess I was able to fine tune my communication skills and learned a lot about what is needed to run a business.  Working with others was usually fabulous, but at times a bit frustrating. So, I was able to practice patience and listening in these situations. My Manager was fair and I did not have any problems working with her.  However, in this type of store there can be many 'managers' which taught me that I needed to communicate certain things to more than one person.  My position was a seasonal (Christmas Holiday) position. In general, customers were upbeat and excited about the holiday which made working with them really nice."
good,"The hardest part is the aggressive sales approach. I do really like the environment and the people I work with, they make selling fun!"

good,"I learned how to interact with people from other countries. The Managements and co workers were very down to earth, easy to talk to. The hardest part about the job was closing time, getting everything in order in a rush. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people find what they were looking for and them leaving with a smile."
good,"GREAT job overall. Typical work day was 5-6 hours, depending on your sales for the week. That determines your schedule. I learned my selling ppotential and how the sales environment really is. You have to be someone's temporary best buddy, be bubbly, fun, loving, and helping at every point in the day!...which was great for me because I love to do those things anyways, but it gets hard sometimes. The management takes care of your needs and schedule very well. LOVED my co-workers, except a couple, hardest art is having a terrible sales day, which in reality does hapen to everyone sometimes. Or having a very horrid customer, which hapens as well.The most enjoyable part of the day is when you get a customer that has an event to go to and you can spend an hour just trying things on and adding to their rooms, and they end u buying 300 dollars worth of merchandise!"

good,nice enviroment and exelent manegement team. awesome hr organization and pefect place to grow
good,"All of the managers were professional, positive work environment. High expectations for personal daily sale quota during a slow season. I felt slightly pushy with customers because of how much of a daily profit they were pushing for. I know when I go shopping I don’t like employees asking me if I need assistance every 10 mins."
good,"You gain your hours based on how well you preform like how much you sell to the customers coming in. Each day you have a different goal to hit and you have to sell a certain dollar amount of merchandise per hour. If you exceed this or hit your target for the day, you are rewarded and the employee that sells the most in the entire week is given the most hours to work in the following week. I was hired to work at $9.50 an hour. I was top seller by my second week of working there and stayed among top 3 for the entire 6 months I worked there. The management was amazing to me and even though I no longer work there I still keep in touch with all go them."

good,I don't have much to say besides that this is that best place to work for a retail job. I don't think I could change my mind unless it was in the feild I plan on going into.
good,"Worked in guess for about six months and in the process had grown to do every position , begain with sales associate , went to managing the fitting rooms ,and closing the cashiers . very friendly  team player and fun to be at work"
good,"Guess was very flexible with my hours which was helpful at the time, because I was working two jobs at a time (Call It Spring and Guess). I believe that my wage was fair for my position and the hours that I  worked."
good,very important brand and fun place to work i would like to grow up in the future with the company and enjoy the time and help out the customer when they need a fashion advice
good,"On a daily basis we took care of the product in the store, handle personal sales with the public and were on and off cashiers."
good,"I’m a sales associate at Guess so I’m on the floor selling our clothing, shoes, and accessories to customers. I have learned to be very social and provide amazing customer service. Also I’ve learned how to work with a big team. The management is average as it can be unorganized at times (slow on making the schedules, missing hours on pay cheques, not providing the best customer service that retail requires you to do). My co-workers at Guess are wonderful people and I get along with all of them. The hardest part of my job would be to make my target as there are days where the store is slow with very little customers. It is a very fun environment to work in as the people are young like myself and there’s a lot of energy in the air."
good,"cool time I spent there got a lot of free stuff "
good,"c'è bisogno di rinnovazione ."
good,As a female you are required to wear heels for at least 3 hours of your shift. The number of hours that you are scheduled is based on the amount of money that you make the company so make sure to try to help as many customers as you can on the sales floor.
good,this was one of the best jobs ive ever had . I was able to be myself and meet a lot of new people from all over the world. the girls that I worked with were really nice
good,"Good place to work, everyone is nice. Some management could be better. Good people learned a lot. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people"
good,"Great atmosphere the days seem very short, but the salary is not competitive and there is no oportunities to grow. It is a good place to gain customer service experience."
good,"Durante l’esperienza presso l’area Finance in Guess Italia ho avuto quotidiani contatti con clienti e banche. Le mie mansioni comprendevano l’analisi di situazioni di mercato e verifica statistica della posizione patrimoniale dei nuovi"
good,This was the only retail job that I had where everyone got along. That is hard to find in the retail industry. The manager I worked with was great to work with.
good,I enjoyed working here while i was in college. I enjoyed the customers and helming pick out the cute clothes for children. The music was always on and placing out new shipment was exciting to see new styles.
good,"A typical day at work for me started with an opening chat with the days goals and progress on those goals along with an update on company progress. Following that I would be asked to do a variety of tasks including train new employees, work the fitting room, ring as a cashier, tasks in the back as a stock person and handle costumer related issues and inquiries. From this job I learned how to effectively multitask and remain a positive attitude while things became hectic and stressful. Along with that I learned great costumer skills as well as managerial skills. Our managers were switched out often and would commonly come to me when they had questions about operation or help with a task and all of our coworkers were hard working and full of product and company knowledge. The hardest part of the job was when there was a miscommunication and things were not done properly and I would have to fix it. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help and make people feel beautiful and confident."
good,"I would sale clothes,shoes, and accessories everyday. I also would do stock checks and stock room work. I also was registered trained so would be on there from time to time. I learned different ways to approach different customs and help them find there needs. The head manger was great but other then that management could have been a lot better."
good,"While working here Ir was a great experience , Very helpful for teaching and learning the pros and cons. A typical day at work would be hard and when its busy you won't even feel it anymore while is the best thing went time flys by while working and meeting new people from didffertn backgrounds."
good,I was a cashier attended for customers needs. Always attentive explaining the products the staff needed. Excellent sales for holiday shopping for family and friends.
good,Overall fun environment to work in. Having a great personality and out-going spirit is a definite bonus. Not much workload and tasks are pretty simple.
good,"J’ai adoré travailler pour la compagnie !"
good,"•	Greet customer upon entering with a smile and sincere non-business like greeting."
good,"I believe what makes  work place is the people. Guess believed in togetherness and growth of its team members. Everyone was given the opportunity to try several positions to see what you really excelled in while allowing you to see what other positions or roles you are able to take up. It was never the same mundane routine, roles were often times switched. However this was done according to your strengths. Guess by far has been the healthiest work space for me which really supported my growth in the retail working world and as a person."

good,"A typical day at work requires me to read emails sent by corporate. I then execute any actionable email that is required. Actionable emails can be anything from an item reprice, a promotion change, or any visual merchandising deliveries we should be expecting to see. I then review the previous day's scorecard to see how much the store made in total sales and where our opportunities lie in making more money. I am personally in charge of the YC (young contemporary) department at guess also known as the women's department. This is 52% of the business at guess. So in addition to looking at the total stores sales I put more focus on this departments sales as a whole and break it down into sub-departments as well such as knits, dresses, woven, sweaters etc,. Depending on my results I may be required to make a visual changes on the placement of merchandise or drive a certain sup department through communication with co-managers or employees.

From this job I learned how to effectively multitask and remain a positive attitude while things became hectic and stressful. Along with that I learned great costumer skills as well as managerial skills. Our managers were switched out often and would commonly come to me when they had questions about operation or help with a task and all of our coworkers were hard working and full of product and company knowledge. The hardest part of the job was when there was a miscommunication and things were not done properly and I would have to fix it.

good,"Guess KYDC has several employee functions throughout the year sponsored by the local HR dept. "
good,"I have been with the company for 3 years and have not had a raise, other than a promotion.

I learned a lot in fashion that I didn't know before I started: How to dress a client with certain body types, what colors compliment different skin tones, as well as how to pick proper outfits by determining clients needs, wants, and likes. Management is very supportive, quick to give you praise for doing a great job, and quick to coach you on areas of opportunity that can help you perfect your techniques, as well as give you new ones. My co-workers always help each other, as well as myself, and I help them whenever help is needed. We believe and cooperate on team selling, progression, and sharing insight for outfits on each others clients. The hardest part of the job is the clients.. In the area where my store is located, the clientele are very specific, picky, and difficult. However, there is always a way to make the most difficult customer become your most  valuable client. I love being able to style my clients and the joy they express when they find that perfect outfit for and event they were searching for, or date, or birthday.Nothing is better than giving them the perfect customer service."

good,"I worked here for about a year and it was my first retail job. Honestly pretty easy, everyone was great and I learned a lot about styling and trends.

I learned how to notice if a customer was ready to buy or just to browse. Also I learned how to properly address and inquiries they may have. My co-workers were fun and excitable, and being the only male working in a mostly female clothing store, I overcame many stereotypes and persevered and came out on top with top sales. The hardest part of the job was breaking the barrier that I was male selling female clothing. It was very enjoyable as I would always close the sale and sometimes have the customer buy more than they intended through my excellent communication skills."

good,"This was my first retail job and honestly, I did truly enjoy the work. I loved all my co-workers and enjoyed helping all our guests out. The visual merchandising was my favorite part. Overall, I enjoyed the work and my only concern was my inability to move further up in the company after being there almost two years."
good,Co workers were nice to work with. My schedule always worked out with school andy personal life. I would like to work there again but they closed down.
good,"The hardest part of the job was having to telling a costumer that we don't have the item they want causing them to yell at me. Also, when I had to deal with a costumer who kept changing his or her mind abut what they wanted to get. In the end though I stayed clam and relaxed and gave those people the best service ever."
good,loved working at Guess store in the stock. Good company plus very welcoming staff. felt welcome and always felt like work was going to be a good day. Would recommend.
good,I was in the company  years and I learned enough and I was comfortable with my team. Also the customer service that we had was the most wonderful that I had. we are excellent in this area.
good,"i loved the discounts i was able to receive when purchasing the clothes, i was able to revamp my closet with a modern style. I learned a lot about fashion and working here started a big change in how i dressed. the hardest part about working here was making sure the head sets were working smoothly, some days they weren't charged and it made it hard to communicate with managers."
good,guess has given me the opportunity to set goals and challenge myself. they  have watched my potential turn stronger each day and have moved me up in the company. the associates i work with are incredible people who all have a great ambition to fulfill the tasks needed to be complete.
good,"The job was successful and the employees along with the management where all kind, however there was a bit of lack of communication in reference to hour availability, ect."
good,My daily task would include helping customers with store merchandise based on their needs as well performing cash register transactions at point of sale. I developed cash handling experience as well as cooperative and communication skills. Constant communication between fellow employees was fundamental to the job.
good,"Sold attire, I learned how to help customers put together outfits and pair items, I liked being at the cash wrap. I hate how a manager need to come and swipe of all returns it just makes it more complicated. I had a lot of fun."
good,"Guess is a really great place to work, especially when you're in school. You learn a lot about fashion in general and about sizing from not only the management team but also your co-workers."
good,"My typical day at work first off if you open in the morning you have to  clean all the mirrors in the fitting room,  sweep the floor or vacuum it.   I was only seasonal   Worked two months.  The managers were very nice and on top of everything and everyone.  The managers will tell you what your position was for that day  either the register or being on the floor helping customers putting them in fitting rooms and greeting customers as they walked in the store.  At closing you and make sure the whole store is clean and help the managers count out the drawers for the day ."
good,"Typical day at work would be greeting clients, setting up displays, serving clients, providing style options and a variety of choices based on clients needs and styles. I excelled in my sales and communication skills, as well as the ability to be personable and likable. This lead me to be the top seller of my store. The hardest part of the job was standing on your feet for long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was styling people, making friends with staff and clients and making sales goals."
good,Lavoro si svolge con dei palmari dai quali ti arrivano gli ordini e i prodotti da prelevare ambiente molto stimolante
good,"Guess has a fun job atmosphere, the people and coworkers make the job enjoyable. They offer discount perks and incentives for making your monthly sales goals."
good,It was a challenging task everyday but at the same time it was fun as we had a great team. Everyday was new and a learning experience to work in a systematic organization.
good,"I have learned a lot from my manager, she is the most understanding and caring person. I have learned a lot about the retail world, and its easy when I have coworkers like the ones that I work with. They make it enjoyable no matter how busy we get, because we are always working as a team. The most enjoyable thing about my job is being able to help out my customers and seeing them happy. Another enjoyable part of my job is hearing their feedback about how they love our customer service."
good,"azienda splendida ,una grande famiglia che ha sempre coccolato i suoi dipendenti , sempre presenti con formazione , consigli e serieta."
good,Great place to work if you enjoy your job.  Upper management is genuinely thoughtful about everyone's individual growth. Always loved going into work and being surrounded by happy and passionate people.
good,"Comercio al por menor de moda. Relación magnífica con superiores"
good,"My typical day was always busy. i always learned about customer service and management at all.My management was to high because i motivated my employees to follow the leader and they were happy to have me i that position i which i bring them all the skills that i know to create a valuable team. the are inspired by me and i recognized all the time asap of their goals.i really don't like do warnings but i enjoy the victories with my team."
good,If you are determined to learn a thing or two about retail and have a good time then this is for you. Management can be tough at times but they can also be wonderful too. I have some great memories working for Guess.
good,"I worked at GUESS as a seasonal hire. It was fun and very fast. I learned alot about cash handleing and how to use the register like a pro. I did not like the roles the managers played in the store. Everyone is employes but i felt that the managers acted like they were more of the owners then the supervisors. The hardest part of the job was standing on my feet for full 8 hours and store closing was the worst on boxing da. But other than that, I would love to work at Guess again."
good,Azienda giovane e molto dinamica dal respiro internazionale.
good,A typical day at GUESS is always fun and very different because of the large variety of traffic and all the co workers bring something unique and interesting to the table that contribute to the company. The most enjoyable part of my job would be being able to have a personal relationship with customers and helping them find what they really need and meeting their expectations.

good,"I had a very good experience working at Zodiac Day Camp. I was a Camp Counsellor so I was responsible in ensuring that the group that I was facilitating had an amazing, safe and positive experience. There was sometimes difficulties with conflicts happening throughout the group (arguments, bullying, etc), but I seemed to quickly resolve it in a professional manner. The staff and co-workers were also excellent, very organized and helpful."
good,"There was no such thing as a typical day of work for me at my job. Some days we were really busy and others were very laid back and not much to do. I was one of the assistant managers and one of my duties was to help in the running of the store. I learned many skills ringing customers out on our register and system as well as our customer service needs. This job helped me come out of my shell because we had to talk to customers and strangers we didn't know to make our numbers and sales. After I became comfortable I quickly rose to being one of the top sellers in the store. My coworkers and employees always talked to me and loved working with me because I get things done and they always have a great time with me. I've been told i'm the easiest person to talk to on management. The hardest part about my job was the Sunday numbers that we had to do which was a recap of the previous week. It wasn't really the hardest part of my job, but involved the most paperwork. What made it hard was remembering all of the pieces of the worksheets I had to do because I didn't work every Sunday. The most enjoyably part of my job were the customers that came in. Some customers came back so often because they liked me and would just stop by to say hello. These were the people that made my job enjoyable aside from my coworkers."
good,"i enjoyed working at GUESS, it has many great opportunities and great people that work there."
good,"Cultuar uma boa relação com seus colaboradores, tanto nas questões voltadas ao dia-a-dia de trabalho, através de orientações em relação aos trabalhos, quanto naquelas horas onde a emoção faz-se presente. É preciso que o líder esteja atento às atitudes de sua equipe, para melhor direcionar sua atuação frente aos acontecimentos."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of coming in, and being assigned to a certain part of the store (i.e. Greeting, Shoes, Bags). I learned alot how to improve in a fast-paced environment as well as improving my people skills."
good,"Co-workers are very nice and friendly, the managers manage very well, if you had a question they will answer with no problem. The hardest part of  the job would be stocking the high shelves that I wasn't able to reach. The most enjoyable moments about the job was working with fun and friendly people. "
good,Coworkers are very helpful. Managers want to help you succeed in all goals in store.
good,"il mattino dovevo aprire il negozzio,la cassa,mettere apposto i manechini e vestirli.sincerrmente la parte piu difficile mi e sembrata quella di imparare ad usare il registratore di casa ma dopo e stato molto facile.ho lavorato per un breve periodo perche non avevanno bisogno di una persona fissa a tempo indeterminato ma mi sono divertita un sacco:)"
good,Everyone is very profession and on key with what management wants from the associates and the store as well.  
good,Great Place to Work

good,Started as a sales associate and became an assistant manager. Great place to learn retail math and treating customers
good,"Learned the company's culture, vision and mission - besides that, the environment and work experience I have lived through it before. Looking for something challenging, new and innovative."
good,"At Guess we woked hard and played harder. The things that I learned was how to address each situation that I faced with staff differently. Which is an asset that I still carry with me today.The hardest things about being a manager was that I had to give hard reviews and the most enjoyable part was the time that we conducted events for customers,( ie. Customer Appreciation Day's). the atmosphere was always electrofying."
good,"I loved working for GUESS in Cerritos. I learned so much being part of the visuals team while still finishing up my last year at college. The people were so welcoming and that's usually the first thing that makes me nervous. They treated me as if I've worked there forever. Management was great up until a time and was one of the few reasons I decided to leave. GUESS Cerritos is a top store so if you decide to work here, just be preapared to work and do your job. There isn't much time to sit and learn but to just do your job. I absoultely loved my co workers. They made working there so easy and hard to leave. I loved my job in the beginning when I was able to learn. The visuals are fantastic if you are starting out. Lots of attention to detail which definitely made me stronger."
good,"Typical day started out with me opening the store with another employee, we would take the bank deposit to the bank, take him/her to breakfast, come back and prepar the store for morning opening. I would check all the emails, along with voicemails, call outs, business calls, shipments, cleaning of store, counting tills for the cash registers. Management was great my customers and employees liked me because I listened and accepted. I helped everyone out the best I could, but never let anyone get to much on me. Hardest part of my job working weekends and nights."
good,You get to meet a lot of different types of people and you learn people skills. Customer service is a very important part of the job. Management is awesome everyone is very helpful. My co-workers are always really nice sometimes we all make plans to meet after work to hang out. The hardest part of the job is the limited amount of hours given to employees its best to have a second job. The most enjoyable part of the job is the discount and bonus' we receive when we meet out monthly sales goals.
good,Great environment and the owners are just amazing people. Work/ life balance. I made a few good friends.
good,"A typical day going to work at Guess consisted of opening up the store with an employee. Start the day by taking the bank deposit from the following night to the bank. Next would be filling out all of the paper work, along with tasks and goals for the day. Checking emails along with voicemails. Read reviews and reports from the closing manager. Next would be shipment coming in, scan all of that in the store. Finally unlock the doors for customers around 9. Then throughout the day just always checking up on my employees, other managers, and always the customers. I learned how to treat employees with respect because I first started as a sales associate. The management and coworkers were the best workers I ever had a chance to work with. Always in good moods and friendly along with willing to work. The most enjoyable part of this job was being inside from the elements and enjoying the customers and coworkers."
good,I learned so much at this job and this is what made me decide to continue my education in business. I learned enough about accounting to want to know more. I worked with a very good friend of mine who helped me in the learning process. I miss this job.
good,A typical day at work is filled with lots of energy and positive attitude. i send the day working with customer helping them find the right apparel. I work with a great team that knows how to help each other out. My managers really motivate us to do our best. The give us tip on how to improve our selling skills. I love working with people and that is what i love must about my job. That i can work with people on a daily basis.

Management has done an exceptional job at keeping the environment healthy and one in which you can thrive in all aspects of your life!"
good,This is one of the best companies I ever worked for. We work as a team to get the job done. I have had the honor of working with upper management that had been with the company for over 10 years. Who have taught me so much in what I want to do in my career. They are supportive and they will support you every step of the way.
good,"At the store level it was very customer focused. The upper management team was amazing. I was a co-manager and while they don’t pay as high as other companies, they do care about their employees and loyalty is everything to me. Bonus structure was great compared to other companies I worked for. The bonuses were attainable. If I wanted to work for a retail organization again, I would go back to Guess."
good,We use to work as a team the coworkers are very nice and the store manager is amazing manager as a human and as a boss.  Working together we used to have very productives days
good,"I enjoyed the work culture. Had an amazing team and working environment.  Love the clothing, can sell it no problem. The down time is extremely boring. Only so much cleaning a training you can do in the day."

good,GUESS? is a good to work at if you like dressing nice all of the time and wearing heels. They were understanding that some cannot wear heels their entire shift. The managers were great and always praised an employee for even the simplest thing.
good,"Highly recommended. customers are friendly as well as workers, very productive and they are flexible with hours. great starter job with amazing discounts."
good,"I stayed at this job for a couple years because I enjoyed more the people I worked with than the job itself.  As a stock associate a typical day involves locking up personal items, clocking in, engaging the person in charge about the goals for the day, processing shipment (up to 45lbs), merchandising and cleaning the work area/sales floor. I particularly enjoyed how management trusted/allowed associates to figure out how to accomplish tasks and often in what order they like so long as the task gets done.  As stock associates of a retail business nearly half my time was spent in customer service.  We were trained to work in all non-managerial facets of the business from fitting rooms to counting registers and were expected to quickly adapt to the conditions of the store.  There is a huge advantage if you speak Spanish. I did not so communicating with half the customers took extra thought and effort. I love solving problems, puzzles, and actively thinking on my feet which made this job enjoyable.  Although the best part is that stock associates were allowed to wear headphones and listen to music whenever we worked in the back room."
good,It was challenging to meet the competitive sales quota but I jumped right in and adjusted right away. It was very fulfilling to make sales and help customers find items they loved.
good,"Such a fun atmosphere at work everyday. Everyday was different and challenging. Fellow employees were great and so was upper management. There was great support to get you to the next level should you want to advance in the company. There was always ongoing training and great opportunities to learn, grow, and excel and move up in the company."
good,"Guess has taught me great customer service skills due to the high standards that are required. Because of the continued flow of customers on a daily bases, I was able to deliver good customer service at a steady flow."
good,I really enjoy working there ..It is as fast paced as you would like and the people are friendly...The hardest parts about the job to me is standing on concrete all day....but it is a warehouse after all .Also the weight of some of the boxes can be a bit arduous.
good,This place makes you feel like family. A typical day was helping the public with their styles and which style to choose for their event. The management was amazing. They help out in anyway they can. The most enjoyable part is being able to help a person feel good about themselves.

good,"As an Asst. manager I was in charge of making the schedule, lost prevention, visual floor-sets, interviewing/hiring employees, organizing store events. I learned allot about customer service, attention to detail, time management and how to motivate your team.The hardest part about working their was handling angry or upset customers. I really enjoyed just about everything while working at GUESS, the other managers were great to work with, we made the environment of the store fun and energetic to keep smiles on the employees faces and the customers."
good,It's a diverse place and there's always something to learn.
good,"A typical 40 hour a week scenario. Schedule is built around availability. Communication is very important as well as being and individual who is bought into the brand."
good,"A typical day at work would be helping customers with the clothing that they feel the most comfortable with. I learned something new every day while I attended this employer. The managers there are very friendly and produce the most assistance towards the employees. The co- workers were very friendly and productive. Kind of like a family, working together for the better. The hardest part of this job was saying good-bye at the end of the work day. The most enjoyable part of this job was realizing that the customers were happy with the attention I provided for them."
good,"work started by setting up the floor and getting ready to open, i learned how to sell what i loved and earn money doing it. management always helped when we needed and always kept us motivated. co-workers were competitive but it is a retail store so this is expected. the most enjoyable part was being able to dress us and sell the things you love."
good,"hay un buen equipo con muy buen ambiente de trabajo, una muy buena organización y aprendes muchisimas cosas"
good,"My typical day at work was i'd clock in and my manager would give me a 5 minute meeting where she'd mention the sales goal for the whole team that day and my individual sales goal. she would give me the update on the fashion trends and any new line of clothing that came out, or any sales or promotions going on. then she would let me know which position i would be encharge of that day. "

It is a great place to challenge yourself and build your retail experience if you can handle yourself in a professional manner at all times whille also clienteling. Its fun with all the new merchandise that comes in every week. You have to keep up to date on the latest and fashionable styles so that you can woredrobe a client from head to toe. Even though my co-workers and I were a team it can become competitive at times when you have to meet individual sales goals which i personally think was the hardest part of the job as cashier. I would have to pay attention to whos' sale i was closing so that the right person would get the correct amount added toward thier goal. Over all, working at Guess By Marciano was an experience i benefited from indefinately."

The HR department was very much engaged with the employees in the warehouse and was always willing to lend a helping hand.
good,This company is a great one to work for. It is definitely a company that you can grow within if you have determination and potential. Though working here has its ups and downs it is great to know that the company cares and you're not just some employee.
good,"Working retail there is no such thing as a typical day.It can vary from super busy to no customers. To friendly customers and to the extreme end. Working there has brought me out of my shell. When 90% of my job includes communicating, it has made me more comfortable approaching customers and helping them to the best of my ability. The most enjoyable part of my day is seeing regular customers remember me by name and asking for an outfit for a certain occasion. The hardest part of my day is dealing with customers with a strong character. It's hard to stay collected when they are raising their voice at me asking me to give them a cash refund when I have already told them the store policy."

good,"Nothing bad to say about this company. Worked for Guess for 8 years. Worked my way from part time sales associate, to full time merchandising assistant at a top 5 store, to assistant manager of the new G by Guess line. The company always had some sort of contest involving cash prizes or clothing to get the associates excited. The benefits were great and it was just an overall fun environment! I really did not want to leave this company but the G brand lost its steam so I came to a bump in the road where I was bored after 4 years of being an assistant manager and wanted a bigger challenge but there was not much of opportunities at the moment. I highly recommend working for this company, the discount is good as well as the quality of the clothing and people!"
good,The best job ever. get up go to work make sales advertisments I learned to not be shy while engaged in sales actitivity . I learned to always smile and make eye to eye contact. my management was amazing coworkers the hardest part when they closed down and the enjoyable was the employee parties.
good,I didn't work at Guess very long but it was nice place to work I was just getting the hang of things and didn't have many hours because I was new but they were good enough.
good,"A typical day at work is to finish the production of the company. I learn a lot of stuff when I go to work every day. The manager is very nice to every one and also are the co-workers. One thing that I love about the co-workers is that they help each other when needed. The hardest part about work is when the company has a lot of productions we have to finish all of it, and sometimes we have to stay over time to finish the production. The enjoyable part about work is that they celebrate the holidays with the employees, it makes me feel like we are one big family. They have games and presents on holidays, which is always fun to have."
good,"opening or closing procedures"
good,Time is not that long to wait because I'm enjoyed and love my work then.My bosses is not that strict and we can talk with them as freinds.

I've become a stronger leader and feel like the skills that I have learned will benefit me in any job in my future.  I am excited to go to work everyday which most people cannot say.

Most of our customers were Latinos and I had more activity, more than the usual because I was one of the few bilinguals in the store. Overall I had a great experience working at Guess.
