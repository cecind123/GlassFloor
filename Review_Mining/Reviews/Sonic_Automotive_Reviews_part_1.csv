rating,review
bad,"This was by far the worst place I have worked at, the management is nothing as I expected, very all over the place and unprofessional. Definitely don’t recommend you work here. Pay was not worth everything you go through there."
bad,Managers are not on the same page.  They will command you to do one thing when you were told to do something different by a higher up.  They lie to you and say they have your back but this never was the case.
bad,"Sonic was a decent job, there were a few rude customers but mostly they were friendly and try to engage in a conversation with you. Everyone that worked there got along and there wasn't any drama really because of our age differences"
bad,"They are losing money, and will lay off employees first.  TheCEO makes $26.2 million a year and will not take a pay cut to save the workers. I do not recommend anyone to work there"
bad,"I would not work for Sonic again. It's a continuous revolving door. They attempted to recruit good people out of their secure jobs as test subjects for positions that they are toying with and when they get them, they just throw you out into the field without any tools. There was no real systems training, job training and the communication is terrible. There is a lot of improvement that could've been made if they would stop their knee jerk reactions and irrational decisions. They could retain valuable and skilled talent if the powers that be in sonic land would just sit, listen to their employees and implement long-term improvement strategy instead of making hasty decisions. They have lost a lot of good people because of that."
bad,this is the most unprofessionally ran company- things change DAILY- there is no norm- to many major impact on family- extreme pay changes at the drop of a hat-
bad,Pay plan sucks managers are order takers then try to fuss at you hated everyday I was there busted my behind my first month and only made 1300 dollars off 9.5 cars
bad,"They do not pay well "
bad,"Management not attentive to associate health and welfare"
bad,"Totally disorganized with poorly implemented rules. For example: you had to wear the company shirt. Unfortunately, they didn't have my size, so they gave me one that was three sizes too big. Needless to say, I looked less than professional. When I asked if I could wear my own clothes until the correct shirt size arrived, I was told that they had been on back order for months, so I should walk around wearing what looked like a tent. I also needed an ipad and key fob to do my job and of course, they were on back order too."
bad,"Here we do not lack meetings, daily!"
bad,"Shady management, toxic culture where gossiping is the order of the day. Stay far away from JLR of South Atlanta. And Sonic Automotive in general the toxic culture is company wide from corporate on down."
bad,This is a very high strung job with very bad management. The turn over rate in the business office is extreme because of the treatment of employees. At month end you are worked up to 13 hrs a day with no kind of break. If you have any kind of anxiety this isn’t the job you want.
bad,"After being pitched the stars, the reality set in on day 1 that the work days would be long and stressful and the working conditions would be downright dangerous. I was told that being such a large organization there was a great support structure, and corporate culture that would be there to encourage efficient work and be available to help where needed. The reality was the farthest from that. Basic IT needs went unmet the entire time I was there, HR was overworked and/or under staffed, or just apathetic. The majority of the staff was untrained and unaware of the most basic procedures and were allowed to work on the most advanced concerns, often leading to complete dissatisfaction from owners. This was well known by management, although very little effort was made to turn that around.    "
bad,"Massey Cadillac (North) owned by Sonic Automotive is the work place to work for any of the job positions. Reason for that being said, is because this company takes pride in showing favoritism especially if you have family members already working there. More than likely, only close grouped family will get at least offered a new position before a person that is willing to work and takes pride in what they do."
bad,"Uses the draw system to rob their sales reps, and as a porter your job consists of a constant game of catch up that never ends. The whole while you are bombarded with managerial tasks that you have no idea how to do because they constantly change the rules. Not worth 12 an hour unless you have other income to fall back on"
bad,"Nothing good to say. Watch your back as an employee or a customer. They want more words, but it is really simple story. It is the car business, not a good thing."
bad,"Family owned. Refused to pay over time, a coworker assaulted me. After defending myself and reporting the incident while he vandalized my vehicle. The service manager fired us both. Three years with nothing but good reviews and kicked to the curb."
bad,"Bullies aged to adults but not grown up cause a hostile work environment. HR can't do anything about it because the bullies don't physically harm you. They work against you instead of with you.  They don't want to fully train you,  saying they don't have time.  You just need to figure out your job duties on your own."
bad,"There were several reasons why people would leave this company. I  would rather keep my opinions and rants to myself. However, I did enjoy the perk of having a discount on my cell phone bill."
bad,"The management at this dealership at this time is dreadful to work for. Non of the sales staff are happy with the current management staff, however they are so heavily compensated that they put up with it."
bad,I was promised sunshine and rainbows instead I can’t pay my rent and going to lose everything I worked so hard for. Ugly truth is so much better than pretty lies.
bad,"Working for this company is extremely stressful. Management does not care about you. There is no leadership. All they care about is their spreadsheets. You will never hear a ""thank you for your hard work."" Its only ""why is this not done?"""
bad,"A large very corporate ran organization, with little concern or compassion for their employees. The demands on management are unreasonable in many instances. Working from 7am until 2am during certain times of the month is expected, with no sense of appreciation. The work must get done and they (very corporate, no one person) have zero tolerance for anything less."
bad,Rivalries and favorites overshadow strong staff and productive dealerships
bad,No real career advancements unless your related to someone or you move shady and can cut corners to get to a fair paying position. The company sees everyone as replaceable and does not give annual raises what so ever! The health care the offer is terrible!
bad,"Starts out pretty good, but the sales grind takes over after the first month and takes over your life. New process supposedly takes the pressure out of sales, but the management is all old school, and they demand perfection and 15+ units a month with high backend products. Constant berating from management, so you need a thick skin. Unless you can close everyone you meet and bring in a lot of business and keep management off your back, reconsider dealership level employment."
bad,"You are just a number to them, if you did not consistently hit your numbers you are easily replaced by the next group of trainees. There is favoritism so if you’re close with management you wouldn’t get reprimanded for example; one co-worker always comes in late but never gets written up they’ve been with the company for a few years where as newer employees get written up or verbal warnings then termination. Even if you go to HR it doesn’t matter they’ll listen to your concerns but do nothing about the issue."
bad,I have been here almost two years and it just seems like all members of the staff are perfectly content with nothing ever changing. Currently management just shows up as if there were a celebrity making an appearance at a party/event and not really caring how they treat their staff. I have applied to work in different departments over the past few months and my application was not even addressed and the job was filled from outside the business. I was told upon being hired there is plenty of room for growth within the company but now I am seeing that was a lie.
bad,"An Okay job. You start off making the drinks, then you work your way up. Sonic has like so many types of drinks. That's what made I difficult but Actually remembering the drinks made it fun."
bad,"You know you have a problem with upper management communication problems when the phrases ""When all is said and done, more is said than done."", ""We can't do it because Corporate is too cheap!"", & ""Corporate doesn't care about their sales staff, they are expendable."""
bad,no real chance for advancement. plan on making the rate you get hired on at for the whole time you work there. most managers are pretty cool until you get to the general manager level and above. corporate managers are for sure a dog and pony show to dealer level employees.
bad,"This company is ok to work for. The benefits suck and are very expensive. They say that their highest priority is employee satisfaction but that could not be further from the truth. A typical day at work is pretty laid back. I haven't yet had the opportunity to expand my skill-set so everything I do comes from skills I already had, I have not learned anything new. The management does very little for employees and if you need something, prepare to ask at least 10 times before your request is taken seriously."
bad,"Their motto is ""a great place to work and shop."" This is a classic example of a slogan highlighting a companies biggest weakness. They know they have an image and moral problem, which is why they made this their slogan."
bad,"No one has the drive to sale or work"
bad,"Management makes fase promises on promotions and pay. Does not pay fairly. There is favoritism. Management does not look out for the well being of its employees, only how much money they can keep in their own pockets."
bad,It can be a little overwhelming at times and the salary as well as the health benefits do not amount to the stress and time spent during the day. There isn't a lot of team work (as we are hired to be a team player) Complaints are some times ignored by management and it's not very structured. I believe the company has potential to be great but management may be a little distracted.
bad,"Worked in the CBS office, it was located in a ran down body shop in a bad part of town. My manager was amazing for the most part and always will to help."
bad,"If you are not an ""in"" member of the organization, they do not care about you.  They prefer friends over people that know what they are doing.  They let GM's that are friends get away with stuff they shouldn't get away with, like lying."
bad,Overall not a bad place. Pay was good. Heavy traffic and lots of opportunity. Management is head heavy and micro minded. Would have stay but manager had poor people skills
bad,"I personally did not find the training very productive due to the fact that things are constantly changing. You're introduced to something new every other meeting, an email is sent out, you may receive a print out on how to approach the situation and if you're not doing well, a supervisor will sit with you. If you're still not doing well, you're penalized for that."
good,For the training I received it was good. However management for the most part was uninspiring and lacked focus or willing to promote and find the skills that an employee was good at.
good,"When I started two years ago, this was a great place to work. New management came in and are forcing out anyone older than 40. Replacing with kids who will work for much less and make their shareholders happy with short term gains. Long term outlook will be the same as every other public company who values stock price over keeping good employees."
good,Working at sonic was horrible. the management was some of the worse I've ever been apart of. As a new worker joins the team other employees such as managers. Are suppose to arrest the struggling worker. But instead of helping they were yelling and being highly Inappropriate.
good,"Buying a car is much easier with their method, but the culture is still the same. GM doesn't spend money on advertising, wants the sales men to close 60% of guest. The ads that are out don't explain the sonic difference. Guides have to explain everything and guest generally want to visit multiple dealers before purchasing. Used cars are a joke, most are priced great but have serious flaws with them."
good,This is my first time in auto sales. Management is not pushy at all it is up to you to do what you need to do. Unfortunately management does not follow thru and some of the things they say they plan on doing. Things just fall thru the cracks they get busy ect. I guess over all not a bad company to work for. Car business is not for me.
good,"With this company for 10+ years.  Left because of empty promises.  Took away employee parking.  Was promised by GM a plan was in the works within the coming weeks.  Months went by and nothing has happened or mentioned.  We were lost souls parking all over the city streets, many receiving tickets.  Job does pay the bills, compensated as long as your willing to work.  Benefits are so so with slightly higher than average costs.  As with any corporate, they are always trying to find ways to cut costs and benefits.  Long working days as a service technician to make hours.  Vacations, pto, holidays are short.  No one really cares if you're and honest, hard working employee always trying to help others.  All they really care are numbers.  And you, as employee, is also just a number."
good,St the beginning I was excited to be there. They were 6 months behind on title work. I got them caught up in no time. Then management changed. New controller told me I didn't do anything there. So I decided to leave plus I was in the process of moving.
good,"Car dealership you get a lot of characters. Managers are fair, product is good, time is expected. Family is always first. Compensation could be better."
good,Employees treated good company buys lunch a lot.  Benefits ok cost is high.  Not much room for advancement.  Employees do not that good of deal on purchasing vehicles.
good,"standard call center nothing special about it they don't really care keeping their employees happy just their upper management. Pay was good, but they make it harder to  earn  your money. QA at this place is a joke"
good,"Back when I started in the business, this was a great group to work for, although the head office was on the other side of the country... we had a great regional team, a great message, but again like so many other dealer groups in the area, it has just lost touch"
good,"Sonic needs to work on its culture. This company also lacks the 3 most important aspects of a job. 1.job security - know that when they want to expand the business and build other dealerships, this comes with budget cuts and 100's of job loss. 2. benefits - the benefits are high compared to other work places and you do not get a bang for your buck. 3. Opportunities to use skills and abilities - this company does not have many of the everyday roles people graduate with college degrees in. A lot of the roles do not even match the description of the positions. "
good,"my experience wasn't very good, but I am glad it happened. I worked at a location that was considered a stepping stone for General managers and it was treated as such."
good,"Really exciting company trying to change the automotive industry.  A typical day for me consists of travel, inspections, and problem solving.  I'm solely responsible for the safety of over 2500 employees which I find exciting and challenging."
good,Pros and cons galore like most jobs in the auto industry. I’ve worked at multiple locations for this company and each one is managed differently. Management makes it either a great place or terrible place to work.
good,"Working hard will get you a $25 gift card and pat on the back. When you do less than your job requires, it'll take 6+ months to find out. Even if you're telling them the problem,  they don't get the word up the chain of command fast enough. Trust is key as a technician. Make one mistake and prepare for another job. They promote ""family"" style of gathering, which is nice but expect them to talk behind your back. If you want a good temp job for little work and decent pay, it's worth it."
good,"Great company to work for when you have the right management staff in place. I've worked for multiple dealerships withing the organization. When I started at my first dealership, the environment and culture was awesome. Through the years, corporate had let great people go and everything changed, which is why I left."
good,enjoy working at sonic. do not like the job insecurity of big corporation.Like the people I work with . I like working in finance because of the responsibility of the job and seeing the deal until it gets funded. Like working with all the lenders to maximize every deal.
good,"This company eliminated a whole department in order to save money, when in fact the company is going to end up losing money without these hard workers behind them."
good,"i spent almost every waking hour at work and it eventually burnt me out, but i was paid very well. If I could work a normal week even if it meant a slight drop in pay I would have probably stayed on as an F&I manager there."
good,"Car business is stressful and not for everybody you will make great money but that costs time from family and time from life, Working 12 hour shift 6 days out the week can be very exhausting and you will burn yourself out"
good,Nothing good and nothing bad to say. You are more of a number than a person but that is typical of these mega dealer groups. Constant turn of managers and associates.
good,"A very large Automotive group with 150 dealerships across the country. Income potential was good but the life balance was difficult."
good,If you like a slow yet steady pace of repetitive work this would be idea career. It's basic processing with heavy emphasis on data entry. There are no real challenges to this position except to process all claims in a timely manner so you don't have to stay late at month end. Otherwise I was not offered any other incentive other then my family's personal needs.
good,I was with Sonic for almost 9 years and over all I feel that it was a good company to work for.  I was given the opportunity to grow and advance within the company and they provided great benefits (for the industry).
good,Department can have more of a uplifting atomosphere. You dont need a degree for the position. Disclaimer position required to lift 15-30 lbs. Training needs to be more structured. Hours are 9am- 6pm
good,"This company went out of business years ago. At the time it was a great place to work. The company was bought out at lease 2 times, and it was on shaky grounds."
good,Laid back job. Nothing about it was hard. The service manager was really nice. He helped us a little. Hate that I had to leave. I wish they would have hired me to stay on.
good,"Typical work day is filled with fighting to get quality tickets, numerous people had access to the system and could look through all the tickets and cherry pick the ones they wanted"
good,It is not a easy job. Vary long hours. No weekends off. Most people hate you. But it can pay vary good. If you can put in the time it will take care of you.
good,Was there too long ago I wouldn't be able to rate appropriately now. But was a decent co. When I was there. All mgt has changed by now. However decent benefits.
good,My management was great and I learned a lot from him. The company went in a different direction and I was sad to leave.
good,"High volume, good training, with training and necessary equipment to  help my customers."
good,Sonic automotive is growing and it is fast paced and a challenge
good,"It is a job that sells cars and uses people to sell cars. You are required to keep a quota going, but it is the nature of the business."
good,"Meet and greet; go over credit application (ensuring accuracy) along with financing options. Discuss warranty, and after market products for purchased car and structure payment plan for auto purchase while building rapport for future business."
good,"fun easy to do and they understand if you are a college student, and will work your schedule. get to drive nice cars and the day is mostly relaxed, good for a side gig"
good,I worked at one of the dealerships in an auto mall owned by Sonic Automotive. Nearly all i heard about the other stores was that it was varying degrees of a nightmare to work there and i can say firsthand that the store i worked at had worse management than the management at the Taco Bell i worked at.
good,Learned to keep up and pay closer attention to detail. Took quality care of the appearance of the parts and automobile. Exceeded customers satisfaction on a daily basis.
good,Great place to work. Long hours if you want to manage a department. but all in all great place. People and upper management was very good and very serious about getting the job done.Great on learning the fixed ops business.
good,learned about sales and working with multiple people on a deal to help customer. learned about vehicles and products versus competitors. learned how to overcome objections by customers.
good,This organization provides ample training and room for career growth and/or lateral  mobility.  There are hundreds of dealerships to work for nationwide.
good,Great job when thing were going good but the at the first sign of a car not being sold the whole environment was toxic. Corporate officers speak of changing the way cars are sold but are not taking the necessary steps to do so.
good,Sonic Automotive is one of the largest automotive groups in the country. My time with this company has done more for my career than any other company I have worked for.
good,"Great work place "
good,"Corporate does not care about long term employees, in reality. They are content with moving their direction and will mow over anyone in their way. From what i have seen, on site managers are no more than ""yes men"" who are not allowed to make contextual decisions that would benefit the store or employees."
good,"Loved the people I worked with, just got tired of the automotive industry and needed a change. The pay for certain positions, the one I held included, was slightly below market average but the close relationships you are able to build with others was a nice thing to have. Sonic allowed me to hone my managerial and organizational leadership skills, so I can't say much bad about them."
good,"Overall, it is a great company to work for! Great culture and great people. CEO is moving the company in a good direction with the One Sonic One Experience."
good,The people made this company what it is today.  There are many people that were there when it started and they continue to work for Sonic today.  That says it all.
good,This is overall a decent company to work for. I just really need a change in my life and they dont offer the change that I am looking for. I'm hoping to find this elsewhere.
good,Overall a good company to work for. My advice to upper management would be to give annual raises to employees to encourage them to stay with the company longer.
good,"I worked as a temp with very few hours every couple of weeks. I eventually had to leave the job for something that promised more hours. However, this was through a temp agency, and if given the opportunity, I would consider working there again. The atmosphere was professional and pleasant."
good,Great place to meet new faces and learn new jobs and the many different cars they sell. This is where I started as a receptionist and became a title clerk.
good,"I worked with this company for many years.   It was my home away from home.   Had many years invested until they appointed a general manager that did not have our store as his best interest.  Out of frustration I left the company and went to work somewhere else that ended up taking way too much of a toll on me.   65 miles away from home,  each way,  and a minimum of an hour on the road each way to travel."
good,Definitely a tight knit group of people and enjoyable to work for. SCB is your average local tax firm handling small to medium sized clients. Flexible work environment and understanding management.
good,"Sonic is a great company that gives you a road map for success. A lot is expected of you, but the rewards are there.  They have a very clear mission statement."
good,Business Technology Department has outstanding personnel that work hard and come together on projects to meet the goals of the tasks. Despite budget fluctuations and changes in requirements the personnel find ways to get the job done when asked.
good,"My department is flexible with hours.  A great environment to work in and the people are helpful.  The setting is laid back, but still professional."
good,Our BDCs are closing all around the country we are getting laid off
good,I enjoy working for Sonic because I was able to move up quickly and was given great support from one of my managers.
good,"Overall, Sonic Automotive, Inc. is a good company to work for and I enjoyed many years there.  They're making a difference and standing out in the industry."
good,good management and good culture.   Long hours.   vacation and benefits provided as well as training.  Busy dealership with lots of returning customers
good,"If there is good General Manager you can work as much as you handle the job, but with bad General Manager is almost impossible to work, I have worked with good GM."
good,"I learned a lot and had great advancement while working at Sonic. The people I worked with were tops.  Unfortunately, there was a pretty major cut back, so I and a host of others were cut."
good,"On a typical day at work you are having face to face interaction with the general public, and we strive for happy customers! We are very family oriented."
good,Allowed me to submit ideas and acct on them. Came in working in fleet and became Director of Business development. I was mov ed to a corporate appointment. and represented 25 automotive brands
good,"write RO's based on what customers needs are, keep CSI above zone."
good,"I didn't like working there, only because this company has their favorites, I personally didn't think it was fair at all. I worked the night shift and there was another girl who didn't like to do anything and when I got my 3 month evaluation the head nurse said that I never did anything. So I choose to leave because of that. I mean I just started working in the medical field and for something like that to be on my record I don't thing so."
good,sonic provided a very challenging and educating place to work.  i like that they provide a place that an employee an continue to grow and learn in their field.
good,"Days can be easy going or very stressful. Your workload is determined by how your previous day ended. Commission is the key. If you do your job, well enough, you will be compensated."
good,Sonic has over 100 stores so if you needed to relocate you could. Lots of opportunity to advance.They are open on some holidays. Really good benefits..
good,Growing company. Lots of upward mobility. One Sonic One Experience... revolutionizing the automotive industry. Huge acquisitions throughout country.
good,"Long days, non-stop work, but rewarding. I learned a lot from my finance director; she was amazing at her job and was kind enough to fill my mind with very useful knowledge."
good,"Growing net profit was and leading the team to the dealers first ever ""Presidents Award"" and Fixed Operations awards."
good,I was promoted whenever the opportunity presented itself.  I was provided with continuing education regularly.  The General Managers and controllers that I worked closely with were knowledgeable and well trained.
good,"Great company, like all in retail, subject to the whims of the market. Sonic promotes a family like environment with nice benefits. The company is ahead of the curve with a lot of its peers and, does a good job of recognizing the disruption in the Automotive space and keeping pace with those changes and challenges."
good,Sonic Automotive has a great culture that is entrepreneurial and where your ideas and voice are heard. Everyone works well as a team and people treat each other with respect.
good,"It's an amazing place to have gotten to work for "
good,"Working at a fast pace, having fun with customers and employee's. Hardest part of the job pleasing customers. Most enjoyable when you do a job well done and get great reviews."
good,A typical day at Long Beach BMW involves walking in to a gracious greeting by all employees including management all the way up to the GM. The people that work at the dealer level are great to be around and enable a positive work environment
good,"Sonic was interested in my development ideas and together we created a platform to develop those ideas. Although not an easy sell to corporate, they soon saw the value in thinking of a better way to do business"
good,"I have had a few different jobs here and each move has been a move up in status and income.  Great company to work for if you are a dedicated, hard working individual.  Slackers need not apply.  Some of the best of the best people work in the dealerships and really care about the customer."
good,I've been in the auto business for 20+ yrs & never experience such a great place to work! Employees are treated as family instead of numbers.
good,Sonic has a strong positive culture who offers real chances to grow professionally in the auto industry. I have been with them for 5 years and have always felt supported and encouraged. They believe in taking the high road in their dealings with customers and associates. I would recommend them to anyone.
good,"Responsible for updating filing system, creating daily spreadsheets to track payments and operating a switchboard.  Additional responsibilities of evaluating, planning, organizing and managing social media channels to target clientele"
good,Management changed when I began with this company and the expectations and results have been for the better.
good,"I loved working with Sonic Automotive.  The benefits and the pay were excellent.  The hardest part of my job would be after five years my department was still not stable and a lot of management change.  I enjoyed my co-workers.  I was very successful at my position and enjoyed helping the new comers learn and watch them grow and make a lot of money also.  That was something that was not done by all of my coworkers.  I always believed being a Senior Rep it was very important to teach new employees the ins and outs of the company,this also helped me make more money."
good,"The leadership at Sonic Automotive is fantastic.  It is a great place to work, they build strong teams on every level.  They hire top level talent so you are usually surrounded by people that are driven and goal oriented."
good,"Learned lots of information"
good,"Sonic Automotive was a very fast paced and almost cut throat as far as getting the sale closed.  "
good,Enjoyed the team and worked well with management. Lots of upward Mobility and company perks. For the most part you were treated well. Lots of emails and meeting was the only negative.
good,Sonic is trying to change the culture and process of buying a vehicle.  They have many opportunities for online training and provide a fair monetary compensation for their employees efforts.
good,Manager at this location refused to pay certain spiffs.  Sonic is g9od company just had a selfish manager at this location.  Company itself is employee friendly
good,"Sonic Automotive has grown tremendously, focusing efforts on the guest and how they want to shop. Going to a more mobile based system has shown that hard work and planning do pay off in the end. Additionally, I couldn't be happier with my relationship with upper management. The key is to work hard and the rewards will present themselves! An excellent company with huge potential moving forward!"
good,I enjoyed working there I had a great time working there management was great I learned a lot about the automotive business.
good,"Sonic Automotive is rapidly growing and there is plenty of room for advancement for those who enjoy the car business. The dealership I worked for had a fun atmosphere and is a good place to work. My position as a sales consultant required me to work long hours, but the commission structure is uncapped and you can make as much as you want if you consistently work hard. "
good,I enjoy working for Sonic Automotive. I have been able to excel in my profession and gain valuable knowledge. I have been able to help the revenue of this company and it has helped me excel in my profession.
good,To work for this group you are always increasing your skill set training never stops. The desire to move the ball to a higher level is a constant. I respected the Regional service fixed director and have know him for close to eighteen years. I will always hold him in high esteem.
good,"I really enjoy working for this company. You always stay busy and the tips in addition to the hourly pay is killer money! The winter months are really slow once the weather starts to warm up again, it's back to business."
good,It was great to learn how to fold cloths and help customers find what they want. Ring customers up.
good,Very professional enviroment to work in. Consistency with all clients.
good,"fun place to work and shop. good work environment , great leaders, very understanding, family oriented  listen to family issues and give emergency time off when needed dealership was recently sold and we are to find new employment."
good,"Sonic automotive was the place that I can say was the stepping stone to my longevity in the accounting office.  "
good,"There is a true camaraderie working at Sonic.  They are focused on promoting from within and they have programs in place to develop the employees that want more out of their career.  Additionally, Sonic has been brave enough to fundamentally change the way people will be buying cars with us.  The sales people are being paid a ""real"" salary plus bonus so for the first time an automobile sales person has a career they can respect and have a job/work life balance! The first market was introduced in the Charlotte market but over the next couple years they will roll this new business plan out to the rest of their 104 dealerships.  The cool thing is that Sonic is investing heavily in the dealerships as they get converted to the new way of selling (called One Sonic One Experience).  The investment makes the showrooms feel more comfortable and technology is at the forefront of Sonic.  The sales people will sell cars 100% from an iPad that has Sonic specific apps on it.  The sales people will even handle the finance portion of the sale ... it is waaaayy cool!!  The most enjoyable part of my job is being at the beginning steps of One Sonic One Experience.  It really is easy to recommend working for Sonic.  The hardest part of the job is that is still a retail business, so Saturday's are must for working and Sunday's are variable.  The pay and benefits are very good!"

As part of Sonic Automotive Family for under a year, I love the fact that we are trying to change the automotive buying process, removing all the pain points for our guests (customers), and proving nothing short of an amazing experience.  I am fortunate as a Training Manager with Sonic Automotive, to go to our stores throughout the U.S., and help our management and sales force change the way we think and the way we  conduct business.

The company has invested millions in its two most recent initiatives - One Sonic One Experience and Echo Park.  Both of these initiatives place an emphasis on the guest experience with the goal of helping customers buy cars instead of trying to sell them a car.
good,"Especially in the automotive industry it is hard to be noticed for doing things the right way.  Sonic says they take the high road, and they do!  Not only is that refreshing, but you get rewarded for doing the same.  Limitless potential for promotion, and a nationwide company add to the draw.  It is the automotive industry, so hours can be long, there can be crabby people, and all 9,000 employees are on the exact same page all the time.  Given the size of the company, progression wouldn't exist if those were not the case.  If you want to work for a large company that you can go places with yet still have a voice, you won't find one better than Sonic Automotive."
