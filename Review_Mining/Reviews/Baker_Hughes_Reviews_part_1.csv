rating,review
bad,Stuck in the dark ages.  Not a fun place to work at all.  No growth oppty they are completely behind the times.  No collaboration among the workers.  Strong lack of communication and diversity.  Leaving this company was the best decision I have made.
bad,"Management and crew leaders have"
bad,"Just another oilfield company that see people as numbers, the benefits are a joke especially the 401k. If you want just a job that pays decent perfect if you want a career it won't happen here."
bad,"Manager looks for themselves or his friends. Rude old co worker, lies over co worker to get them fired!!!!! Loud stinky environment through forklifts in the shop."
bad,No work life balance. Management only looks out for themselves and their friends. Numerous pay cuts and layoffs for the field and nothing for the office
bad,Baker Hughes has unfair practices management has been in place for years.  They hire people use them and dispose.  You can work hard and if your not one of the long time employees they use you as an escape to justify their mistakes. I would not recommend to work for Baker Hughes
bad,"unprofesional behave so how they could provide services, very low on communications "
bad,Bad managers! They dont know whats really happening. Very poor.communication! No benefits. No.job security. They fire all the good people. Too.much working hours
bad,Worst managment I’ve ever encountered little reward managment pushes unrealistic goals and punishes for not getting them  little to no overtime and favoritism
bad,I do not recommend them to anyone. they do not have any respect for employees. I would never work for this company ever again. you are just a number to them rather then treating you as a individual
bad,My resume speaks highly of the time I took to help others at Baker Hughes and lead others to a safe working environment. Lead off with start off meeting at the beginning of the shift and weekly meetings every week.
bad,i will never aqdvise you to work for a large oil company because their one and only goal is to make money and you will be lost in that whirlwind trying to do the same for your self. it is a toxic environment for your soul. enough said.
bad,"Management liked to choose favorites, nepotisim, favorotism, a lot of managers not in touch with customer needs.  Very political environment, a lot of favoritism"
bad,If you want to be classified as a number and nother else this is your place to work. No time off with low paid but you can where the BakerHughes patch an your chest and that makes up for the lack of pay
bad,"meh, not a great environment for the brain that is a fact, let alone one's body. no community or peer support, money driven business, too large for my liking. all together not a good experience for me. it showed me the value in education."
bad,"Worked for them for many years, 320 plus days a year and was recently laid off and now they won't give you the time or day.  It is defiantly not what you know but who you know."
bad,Have rated this company and have said that they had good crews that pulled together to get the job done for the customer and worked well together
bad,"The worst place in Houston to work. Several years with no increases and senior management does not care. The work conditions are awful with no desk phones. The phones were removed in a ""cost savings."" program. You are expected to do more with less and mostly never get to backfill any empty positions"
bad,"No work Life balance, terrible leadership. Threaten job security all the time. Have been working on a project that should have been completed years ago. People with personal life altering situation stay away, they do not understand or care."
bad,"Typical union shop.  Most long time workers avoided their daily duties and it got pushed off on the new guys. Unless you like working for free, then don't apply to a union factory."
bad,To much in house fighting and back stabbing in the office by operations personnel in the office made it hard for the guys in the field do do their job and keeping clients happy with their dealings.
bad,I enjoyed coming to work well any way right up till a few monthes ago when all the stuff with haliburton started to fall through. enjoyed working with my crew learned a lot from them baker definatly made me use my head to think about advancement
bad,This is not a good place to work. They do not value or treat employees with respect.The problems with this company are not due to local management.
bad,"Very good place and company to work for, Enthusiastic and friendly atmosphere and people, great co-workers, very good benefits and pay top of market, really good facilities. However: to many changes on the management in my department in the last few years."
bad,"Working with the guys at Baker Hughes is the best part of the job.The work it self is easy but the management makes life harder then it has to be by constantly lying to you or just flat out ignoring saftey issuses .They dont give raises and theres no where to advance to once your in thats your spot and your wage for the time your there.Also they love to set you up to fail ,by sending you out with unsafe equipment,that they say is good but no one actully has signed off on."
bad,nothing good to say so I don't want to say anything. bad is not a word that should be used in a review. tell it to the mountaion
bad,"Si por mi fuera me hubiera retirado en Baker Hughes"
bad,This company was one of the best ones on the market sadly it is now the worst there is an aribic dictator running the shop that has no clue what manufacturing is about everyone in upper management are related to each other all the good management and machinist are gone not to mention they are selling out and moving don't waste your time.
bad,"I guess since they got bought out by Haliburton, that proves the poor management I experienced when I worked at BHI. I was a contract worker working as an administrative assistant and worked 3 assignments in 3 different departments. The first assignment went well and ended after two months. The second assignment lasted a month and they said I ""didn't fit."" The third assignment also ended after a month due to ""budget cuts."" They wanted me to come back to a 4th assignment, and I said no. The humiliation of getting fired twice for no reason did not make me feel like ever working for BHI again. Besides that, BHI seems to ignore when an employee is padding her timesheet and making mistakes. I worked the same job with that employee, sharing the same duties. She would pretend she arrived earlier at work than she did, and on her timesheet which she left in her desk, she would put down that she left later than she did. She even put in for days she didn't show up. Yet the manager did not catch on, and I was the one let go for budget cuts instead of her. So, I will NEVER work for BHI again."
bad,"I worked for Nowsco-Fracmanster-BJ-Baker-Halibuton for several years.  Survives seven layoffs, was laid off twice."
bad,"good help from supervisor,nice working atmosphere,helping each other more facility.quick response from people.more chance to learn new thing."
bad,"The whole ""management"" team were incompetent and and impossible to deal with. Favoritism was played on a day to day basis. I would not recommend working for this company at all."
bad,Awesome company to work for as a contractor.  I wish that I could have been brought on as a full time employee.  Very family oriented department that I worked in.
bad,horrible job wash bay hands were not treated good long hours but fairly compensated for the work good benefits
bad,frequent changes in management affects the company. Great opportunities only if you know people in upper management.
bad,"Baker Hughes preaches Stop Work Authority. But when an employee uses his or her SWA, they are severely punished and or fired. The management team at BHI, really has no clue how to operate."
bad,Lacing of Management. Rest less work. No appreciation. No leaves for the workers. Good place to learn. No Growth opertunity.
bad,They are not a honest company. They are very secret about everythong
bad,working long hours in oilfield learning more about fracking on oil and gas. Our management is very bad and I got great coworkers. The hardest part of the job being gone most of the time but the most enjoyable about I get see the world.
bad,"Water Treatment Technical Sales Specialist - Sarnia, ON - terrible, made up position - tread carefully with these guys, unprofessional."
bad,A company of that magnitude does not have a training program for their new hires.
bad,I work for this company for one year I was promoted fast I was a safety coordinator but when it got slow they send me for a random drug test I tested positive for meth I never use drugs in my life they told me they were going to help me get my job back but they don't care for you and when I was working there a supervisor tested positive for a drug test they let him test two days later and he didn't pass so they let him go but told him in 6 months you could come back I took a hair and urine test one day later and I tested negative I pass the test but they didn't help me BC I am Mexican. PS the supervisor was white.
bad,"Worked for Baker for over 4 years - I was injured on the job due to the magnet being broken on our lifting crane in the machining department - management was notified during a ""safety"" meeting but no repairs made - this caused the staff to have to manually lift and manuver 100+lb parts in and out of the mills and lathes - we were on mandatory 7 12's - this is rough on ones back to say the least - I suffered 6 herniations on top of 3 I had already herniated - Baker would not cover the initial injury under workers comp so I had to go on short term disability which only covered me for 6 months... I was released back to work ""light duty"" by my Dr... I arrived at work and was told there was no ""light duty"" and if I wanted a job I needed to get on the floor - mind you I have 9 herniations - so I went to my station - not long into my shift I was raising a cantelivered table and felt a tearing pop in my back between my shoulder blades... I told my supervisor and he called the company nurse... she informed me (without an exam) that I ""probably pulled a muscle"" - I was not allowed to leave and seek medical attention - I was told to sit in the break room with ice on it for the rest of my shift (5 hours). I saw my doctor the next day and was pulled from work and placed on workers comp... however the only thing that Baker would cover was a ""sprain of the shoulder"" which was not my injury but because the company nurse said that is what was injured that is what they covered... it took 7 months to get an MRI approved which showed that my herniations had increased in size - this was all dismissed"
bad,Can't go into detail except to say it was a terrible experience. I thought I'd hit the lottery only to have the lottery close.
bad,Not very good and no life. People are idiots. Very competitive . Not the best money. No advancement. Pay not the best. Clicky place to be in to make friends
bad,"My close co-workers were great, but the company culture is definitely not a team environment. Management is detached from their customers, and some have no idea what their direct reports actually do. "
bad,"L'équilibre entre vie perso et vie pro est difficile. Il n'est pas rare de se voir refuser des congés ou repos demandés longtemps en avance à la dernière minute."
bad,This place I would not recommend to work. The management does not care about its employees. There is so much nepotism that goes on with the management. Worst place I've ever worked.
bad,"Have you seen horrible bosses? Thats what oil and gas is like. Low pay, micromanagement, and ill prepared management. It seems if you want to succeed than dont work.  Those are the people who get promoted."
bad,"I moved my family to North Dakota when I started working for Baker Hughes with the idea that I would be able to see them more if they lived in the same state that I worked. This was not the case."
bad,"I work for Baker Wireline for 3 years. Some of thing they do is send you out on jobs even when your out of hours on your DOT log book. So when you tell them I'm of hours they say make it work or you should never run out of hours. So they send you out on a job Any ways and then they don't ever wont to send your relief when you days off come around they just say we have nobody so let me see what I can do. They have no integrity. You now they talk about that a lot our core values Integrity, Teamwork, Performance, Learning, and Courage but the management at just about ever base don't care about them unless its convenient for them. They just want to see is efficiency, high revenue percentage, and no problem out of anyone or equipment. That also means being on the edge of losing ever one of there employees like the Tyler Cased hole Shop."
bad,"A typical day at work was easy as long as you knew what you were doing an had a good crew"
bad,"KNOW room for advancement . you pass a test to get a raise , that can take up to a year to get raise. supervisors are only out for themselves . very little English spoken there so make sure you speak Spanish . Worst place i have ever worked at , stay clear"
bad,"The job itself is great, the team mates are okay. The management, culture and HR team need new faces, competent ones. An overhaul of HR would be awesome."
bad,Management is running it down into the ground.  No opportunities to move up in pay or title. Raises are cents per year.  Not enough work to keep everyone busy.  Yet they keep hiring new people.
bad,"Company is led by Executive Band Level personnel (EB's). EB's treat regular employees as necessary servants to fulfill their needs.  Employee's aren't people, they are job functions.  "
bad,"BHGE is definitely not the same company I joined when it was BHI.  The culture has changed, as has the morale of the workforce.  Experience and knowledge has walked out the door to other companies and it's irreplaceable."
bad,"Poor management, people quitting quickly, short-handed, overworking employees, WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND WORKING HERE TO ANYONE.  Don't apply, managers don't care about employees - all they care about is getting warm bodies in.  Safety culture is failing."
bad,GE Oil & Gas overpaid for Lufkin Industries and proceeded to take the company apart in the middle of a downturn.  Production was offshored.  A profit was never realized.  They've since merged with Baker Hughes in a joint venture.
bad,"The company is run by the bunch of low skilled characters. The promotions are only given to close friends and relatives of managers. No matter how hard you work or how much sweat you put in, no reward or recognition given."
bad,"Company has no direction, too much change in a few short years and the oil market is still too volatile."
bad,"The GE Oil & Gas portion of the Baker Hughes company is dying.  Leadership is poor. Many have no Oil & Gas experience and the standard is to move every 18 months to a new role.  This trend is hurting the business as the current need is long term buy in from leaders with experience.  The go to market strategy is yet to be set and customers are not happy.  Employees are stressed due to high layoffs and poor management. Very political environment and with poor performance, the morale is very low and very cut throat. Cost cutting is the priority with little concentration on driving sales and improving customer relations."
bad,"You should not have to walk on egg shells and always be looking over your shoulder while working. Employers shouldn't force their employees to do 3-4 other employees' job. Highly stressful and completely unorganized company. Management will lie to your face telling you one thing and then do something different. They do not believe in the retaliation clause, if you ask to speak to HR you will be laid off."
bad,"Baker Hughes was a great place to work until it became ""Baker One"" several years ago.  From that point on it went downhill.  Unrealistic expectations were passed down, with zero appreciation."
bad,"If you are injured on the job be prepared to be terminated over something ridiculous or forced out because you are tired of being harassed, intimidated, or humiliated."
bad,"Too many wannabe supervisors. Mgmt doesn't care about the hourly workers at all. Been seeing a lot of favoritism going around in example a non cdl driver driving and backing a 40ft straight body tanker that was hazardous and loaded. which is 1- not allowed by policy 2-unlawful 3-couldve easily hurt himself, others, property and management completely disregarded this.  I would never work here Stay away from Baker Hughes/ Halliburton"
bad,You find yourself threatened with your job daily.  Hours are irregular 24 x 7 on call some 20 + hour days.  Management was constantly changing 5 managers in 7 years
bad,"Strange for an Oil and Gas Specialty company who have roughly 90% of their employees hired with out any Oil and Gas experience."
bad,"District Trainer – Certified to train and lead Field Operators in maintaining and operating cement field equipment, (i.e Cement Pump, Cement Bulk Unit, and other equipment used in cementing). Assist Field Specialists by organizing responsibilities for Field Operators prior to arriving to the oilrig job site. Oversee the comments and actions of Baker Hughes personnel to ensure company policies are being upheld. Conduct classes and demonstrations for new hires on Baker Hughes’ Safety Policy and Rig Up procedures. Effectively communicate any new policies put in place by Baker Hughes to Brighton District personnel. Certify and recertify new and existing Baker Hughes’ employees on their ability to drive, and abide by the rules of the Department of Transportation (D.O.T).        "
bad,"Just don't. No advancement. Always changing guidelines for raises and promotions to prevent any. HR is a joke. ZERO time off. And i think any one who works works, (not in an office) will agree with me."
bad,"Baker Hughes is one of the worst companies anyone could ever work for. I have worked for Baker Hughes for 2 years and that is only because Gel Technologies sold out to Baker. Baker does not care about its employees, especially when it comes to their bottom line. They will baffle you,  all the while trying to starve you and your family. "
bad,"el trabajo  no es muy difícil pero hay gente que nadamas  esta viendo algo que no le guste para chismear,"
bad,What was once a great company to work for has quickly became a environment that puts very little value on employees. They continually increase the workload and responsibility without any increase in pay.  Because of this morale and quality suffers causing loss of customers which causes managment to try strategies to reduce employee compensation which then causes loss of morale and more customers in a neverending downward spiral.
bad,Baker Hughes pays very well but has the worst management staff I've ever seen. No way to advance in your role. People constantly blurt out racist slurs freely and nothing gets resolved. They don't care about your outside life. Overall I don't see this place standing for much longer. With all the racism that goes on up there I'm shocked the news station hasn't formed a story yet.
bad,"It's a circus without a competent ring leader!"
bad,They make promises they don't keep.  Baker Hughes employees let go regardless of how many years of service.  They call it corporate restructure.  The let you go then hire someone else for the same job you were doing.
bad,This is a place you go to die.  Nearly 100 hours a week work with no planned time off and cut throat management that cares more about their own gains politically.  Advancement depends on who likes you and only highly unqualified people manage.  The top roles and highest paid positions were chanced upon and the entire industry is a fraud.
bad,"After the last slowdown of 2015, this company has gone to the dogs. It used to be a great company to work for, now it is cut-throat. People lie to keep their job. Even if you prove your work was with parameters they still treat you like you were wrong. They don't accept contract workers, saying they have enough friends at home looking for work who use to work for BHI. Now they are a with GE and it has only made it worse. Everyone is scared"
bad,Spent too much to buy our company. Eliminated the high profit service jobs. Sent the remaining manufacturing jobs to china. Laid off the remaining employees. Closed down the factory. They have no business being in oil and gas.
bad,"In eight years I've gone through 3 general managers. 4 welding engineer's and 10 supervisors. GE is hurting for revenue so badly their selling off any product line for a quick buck while constantly saying we're okay and turning the corner. Over the past 10 years every company that was purchased by GE has been ran into the ground and sold for pennies on the dollar. Estimated 22.3 B cost with $0 return and most by now are fully closed for business. I'm embarrassed to have been apart of the corporate monster. Management is worthless. Gears in a cog and repetitive thinking inside a very small box. Thanks Flannery. No one can make since of their financial books so they've paid the US government for assistance. Charges have been filed against past and present CEOs and cheif financial advisors. What was a strong, proud, well built American company is now just a joke."
bad,"Quick example of GE mentatility: When asked by salaried employees about exploring 9/80 workweek or work from home days to save commute cost, General manager said he doesn't trust people to actually get work done at home and 9/80 cost the company money because it loses out on a full day of work because his salaried staff is expected to work 10+ hours per day anyway."
bad,"The leadership at the local level is worst then a used car salesman."
bad,Working in the Oil Field is very very hard work and I was the only women on the job so it was a watch your back on a daily bases job. You worked 12 hours or more for very good pay but it was hard work.
bad,"When you are at the interview they will give the illusion of a great culture, but once you get in and start working you will be thrown to the wolves and criticized for EVERYTHING you do wrong, and you will be written up for things you were never told not to do, and everyone is cut-throat.  They will also treat you as if you know nothing even though you proved yourself in the interview."
bad,"The diversity and company package is good for a salary employee. Aside from that, they are not very nice. The slackers, under achievers & the ones that don't care get promoted. CLEARLY! The hardest and smartest employees get fired. Hourly employees get dumped on and don't stand a chance of survival.  p.s. people disrespectful and unprofessional too."
bad,"company does not take care of employees,"
bad,Very unsatisfying experience. Poor management. There was an overwhelming  level of bureaucracy. At the management level there was a poor attitude towards customers.
bad,Baker Hughes is a company that is being consumed by the Halliburton merger. Management at all levels is pre occupied with their job stability and thus the employee base is too. Decisions are being made
bad,"Good working day , I learn QMS and safety ,management was good , good co workers , i work full time only , i really enjoy about learning"
bad,"Horrible company to work for.  Do not let the benefits sway you from joining this individuality environment.  The pay is lower than any sister company in this field.  I along with many other employees was discriminated against on a DAILY basis.  When you finally have enough of it and decide to tell someone, you get terminated!  this is not a work environment that anyone with integrity should consider."
bad,"At Baker you work harder not smarter. Management has degrees, but no experience, expect unrealistic expectations, don't appreicate the good employees, or hold the bad ones accountable."
bad,If you like working with co-workers without OSHA training & are looking to get crippled or killed this is the company for you. Values profits over personnel. A revolving door of inexperience and incompetence.
bad,"This was a good company to work for BUT during the bad economy on round three of lay offs in the Mt. Pleasant, MI office I was laid off. I was told during the exit interview by the Corporate HR Manager that I was eligible for rehire. Over the next 2 1/2 years I applied over 2 dozen times for the same Operator position I had done for 5 1/2 years. Finally I was interviewed over the phone by the Corporate office in early 2011. The interview went well and I was told that it was up to the office manager in the Mt. Pleasant, MI office to say if I would be rehired. I receive a message stating that ""I didn't have the experience necessary to do the job and if something else came up that fit my qualifications, they would call me"". WHAT? During my 5 1/2 years working with Baker Hughes, I never had a bad write up, I was on time and always available, I would do above and beyond what was asked of me. They were more interested in hiring people without experience so they could pay less money than hiring someone who could do the job with little training. I was very disapointed in Baker Hughes after this. I understood that the economy caused many jobs to be lost but the way they handled this was completely wrong. Shame on you Baker Hughes of Mt. Pleasant, MI."
bad,"Hired 30 new employees out of the Portland Oregon area that commuted back in forth from Portland, Oregon to work in Bakersfield, California. The new workers were hired to be mechanics and field operators. When they got there they stood around sweeping, and washing trucks, because the company lacked a plan for them. As a reward 75% were fired for no reason after a month and a a half on the job."
bad,"What do I think of Baker Hughes (BH)? "
bad,If you don’t mind working with brown nosers who are more than ready to throw you under the bus to make themselves look good this is the place to work. Look all I am saying is try to keep to yourself the people there are intrusive. Great pay for the price of peace of mind.
bad,"a lot of favoritism, your experience was not recognized nor was you knowledge considered of any value for impute into the job you were doing. Having logged over a million miles in my past I felt my contributions to the company along with my experience were meaningless"
bad,"The pay and benefits were good, but only 3 things matter to this company: cutting costs, stock price, and metrics.  Everyone I knew was in constant fear of downsizing and when it happened it was often in critical places with no plan on how to continue performing.  Everyone else was expected to pick up the slack, even when system constraints prevented the same person from having multiple roles.  When these issues were brought up, the standard canned answer from upper management was ""figure it out!"" "
bad,Current Management is clueless.  It has become a place where brown nosing gets you VP positions.  Hard work and dedication is not valued anymore.  Its not what you know its who you know.  C level execs get involved in approving purchase orders for as little as $500 and it takes weeks to get the approval.  Work stops while execs think about critical PO's that are a few hundred $'s while the same execs are running around all over the world flying in Business and running up tabs of $8-$10K per trip.  Salary increases are non-existent.  Bonuses are a joke.
bad,"Uma empresa que não se preocupa com o turnover, segura os funcionários pela necessidade e pelo sonho de fazer uma faculdade. Oferece salários baixíssimos e ainda atrasa os pagamentos, não respeita seus funcionários."
bad,"Printed customer orders list and Monitored Dispatch Lists all day, Ordered gauges also, could be stressful trying to keep up with Orders, Management was out of touch with shop floor and overall Operations. Working with the machinist and scheduling group  was the best part of the job. working with foreman was the hardest part. was a good place to work at one time."
bad,Management are least educated and experience people I have ever worked with. Talking BS is your clear path to bright future not your knowledge. I dont think it would be a successful company and it will be broke soon.
bad,"I worked for BJ services and that was a great place to work, great crews, awesome coworkers. One of the Best District Managers I've ever had the privilege of working for. Until Baker Hughes bought us out, then it all went down hill, they had no clue what it took to perform in this industry. A lot of good guys lost a lot because of the mistakes this company made, some even their lives. I'll never forget working 72hrs straight in three separate locations while rig runners moved our equipment because we were out of hours and under staffed, sure the hours were great if you could find a way to get it in on the same pay week otherwise you were pulled off the job. We were treated like garbage, over worked, no rest our curtains removed from our sleepers at one point and locked away. This is not a company I recommend unless you like looking for work because you will be doing just that later."
bad,"These guys have absolutely no idea how to run an industrial construction project.  They have NOONE above the floor level supervisors that have ever done any Oil and Gas work.  Most are from other divisions in GE such as aircraft engine, train manufacturing, appliances."
bad,Was very good company until G E bought it   Went down hill fast wanted to change every thing nobody new nothing management style terrible very poor outlook take easy way out not able to see full potential
bad,"Long hours away from home."
bad,"From day one at it was nothing but chaos. I had no manager for the first two months I was employed there and no training or support from upper management. When a manager was finally put in place, this person had no idea about what we were really selling nor the sales process involved. Overall, if you want a secure job with opportunity for career advancement, I would not suggest this place."
bad,I worked at Baker for 2 years. Worked a hundred hours a week and got screwed out of lots of days off. Management doesn't care about you. They will work you to death and not appriciate you!
bad,"They gave me a truck with software that did not work for GPS tracking. I reported it, twice, and they did NOT repair it. Then they used that non functioning software to discipline me?"
bad,"Fully functional organisation, with silos unwilling to support, very poor project management with no procedures clearly issued and understood, and without any audits on the quality of work."
bad,This could be a great place to work if the kinks were worked out.  The focus changes too much.
bad,Compliance department had 9 people leave in one year.  Enough said.
bad,"its a job , but dont count on being there long term unless you love a confusion and working long hours for no good reason.  they promote the wrong people and dont value the ones who do the work"
bad,I enjoyed working with the US land team. I worked with hardworking and intelligent folks and that did bring out the best in me.
bad,"Sofri assédio moral pelo supervisor do centro de controle de segurança (Niterói- RJ), fui ao compliance da empresa e nada foi feito."
bad,"normal "
bad,"* Routine day-to-day work"
bad,"Great employees"
bad,"I left the company for several reasons:"
bad,"Long hours, managing people who make twice your salary. Field Engineers are paid poorly for the hours they work.  Equipment was poorly maintained and management was resistant to spend money on process improvements."
bad,"The division was not organized and was not up to par with the customers requests and needs. Because of this, business was lost due to upper management poor attention to detail on giving the best service to the end user."
bad,"... otherwise you are disposable and doomed!"
bad,"After the price of oil dropped, customers stopped buying deep water blow out preventers. We ran out of work and layed off a lot of people. Our shop failed to adapt to the market."
bad,management was in a palace while the workers did the dirty work and management took all the credit.  management did not know what it was like outside the crystal palace.
bad,I have learned to provide extra attention and multitask on job during regular hours of support to user. The hardest part is to balance the time in supporting the user.
bad,"I very much enjoyed working their most of the time and got on well with everybody. Sometimes workload was to much and involved working long and unsociable hours, but not always. I felt that I was good at my job and got alot of self satisfaction."
bad,"Start my day with conference call with  team member review progress  and critical milestones.  "
bad,long hours and travel away from home for weeks at a time. upper management was completely clueless on the day to day operations and wanted to micro manage every step.
bad,"I like Baker Hughes oil services Company because of hearing in OGDCL (where i am working) about its good reputation ."
bad,"I drove the worker back and forth to the oil fields."
bad,"It was Definitely a learning experience. Difficult work schedule, but the oilfield is a challenging business. Good pay and benefits though. I did gain quite a bit of experience. And my CDL and driving experience will hopefully serve me better in the future."
bad,Throughly enjoy working everyday on projects everyday love a different challenge
bad,"It is a nice place to work, challenging, innovative and team oriented people. good salary,bonus, vacation.Oil field application job is always hard working and rewarding"
bad,"when I worked with baker hughes incorporated, I experience no job bonus, work day/night, learning new challenges of jobs and co-workers."
bad,I enjoyed my job and worked well with other crew members. the hardest part of the job was that it took me away from my family.
bad,"Roles and duties related to logistics support: Registering and updating files of shipment, preparation of all necessary documentation for export, import and customs clearance  (shipping Invoice, packing Invoice, company letters to the Customs Authority). Mail and phone correspondence to the freight company / customer broker with the request of freight cost (airfreight, road freight), customs clearance, coordination and controlling the temporary import/export. updating file of all shipments and entering detailed information to the global inter-company system (KPI met or not met), identify root problem and find solution to resolve it. Weekly report to the management of every shipment and full monthly report of export/import to the client (BP)."
bad,"The company has been in constant reorgs since 2009. There is too much red tape to get anything done. There is no clear direction or communication, typical information is given only after the information after the fact."
bad,lacked workmanship to work as a team and poor processes and poor leadership when working as a team. No procedures in place for new employees or contractors.
bad,"Chaotic with no leadership or structure.  The management was not  based on leadership.  Employee's with differing opinions were belittled and criticized.  Failure to plan and understand lead times, unrealistic promise dates to customers.  Failure to obtain root causes and constant repeats of failures.  The hardest part of the job was watching knowledgeable, long time associates leave, the most enjoyable was the alternate work schedule and working from home, away from the mayhem and chaos."
bad,"I was hired on as a N2 pump hauler and operator. One week before my 3 months kicked in with my benefits they stopped sending me on jobs, effectively making it so I'm not making money anymore just sitting at the shop, the day before my 3 months, I am let go without any hesitation or reason behind the issue."
bad,"very difficult environ to work, very prejudice."
bad,Low pay and no training before starting work. Upgraded PC's and MAC machines by removing old machine and replacing with new. All software and hardware were taken care of by another group.
bad,"My day was what I made it. Biggest issue is management has its head in the sand  with a view of the world that does not fit reality. I have nothing more to say. Can't say something positive, say nothing."
bad,I picked the wrong shift. Supervisor was new and didn't spend any time on the floor. I have decades of experience and was never trusted to perform my assigned job. I was hired because of my experience then called a liar everyday because of the shadowing by the so called trainer. Paranoid management.
bad,"1) working with constant stress and pressure."
bad,"Not what I was expecting from a big company like baker Hughes since they merged with GE there is no overtime the yearly bonus and raise are very low now GE wants to sell baker Hughes because they are not making no money, all the cnc machines lathes or mill are hands free and everything is pre set for you pretty much all you are is a button pusher not a real machine shop, the management is very poor they go base of what they guys in day shift say pretty much the old machinist in day shift run the shop the supervisor are never there all they care is about the numbers and that’s it, you have to watch your back people go around spying to see if you are working or not they even take pictures and go tell management also if you are making too much production and you are making the guy in day shift look bad they will tell you too slow down or just change your offsets or move tools out more so you would crash your machine would not recommend this place at all specially if you are a real machinist."
bad,"An employee after working every Saturday for over a month requested to work only a half day on the upcoming weekend (citing they're feeling a bit burned out and wanted to spend some time with family).  Management stated there is plenty of work that needs to be done so plan on working a full day.  Again employee stated feeling fatigued/burned out, and management again said plan on being at work for a full day.  This company preaches Safety and Family oriented, but clearly cares more about a schedule!"
bad,Job was enjoyable when I first started but when the industry slowed down your job wasn't secure and favoritism took place over experience. Field personel were great to work with
bad,"At Baker Hughes, you were just another number to the management staff. All they care about is making money, will make field personnel work over 100 hours per week. If there were complaints, they were fired."
bad,"You could work 19hrs a day every day for 365 days, while others barely work and it still wouldn't be enough and when raise time comes once a year, everyone gets the same raise. No chance of promotions unless you're related or best friends with management."
bad,"The management was very uneasy, only concerned about maintaining it's own job security.  Workers would try hard to have a great work environment, supervisors and managers constantly fought against workers trying to enjoy the work day.  Supervisors wanted an environment appearing to only work and have no conversation especially enjoyable conversing."
bad,"Don't expect a warm fuzzy feeling from BHGE.  They will suck all they can from you, and then cut you when they are through with you.  You are just a number.  Expect to work long days with impossible workloads and to ""Just be grateful you still have a job""  GE is replacing all Legacy Staff with their own people.  No stability or security, people walk around on egg shells."
bad,"Typical day was servicing completion tools, best part of the day was working in the field setting or pulling completions tools."
bad,"GE Oil & Gas has terrible benefits and they work you like a slave.  Managers are expected to put in 80 hour weeks or you get put on a performance plan.  Just pass this one by, it's not worth the headache"
bad,"This division of GE is ran by a leadership group that cannot agree on strategy, process, procedures or policy.  They are the paying the lowest wages to their employees within their respected trade for the area.  They are they type of leadership that offer one thing such as a certain schedule, pay or reimbursement, and fail to follow through, and just as any large American corporation, have the lawyers and loopholes to back them up."
bad,"GE Oil & Gas has little value for its employees.  Will overwork you, will take little interest in giving you time for a personal life, management is quick to point the finger"
bad,Work is ok training is very poor. Work hours are very odd some times you work 80 hours next week you work 40 hours. The down fall is you are expected to work in the middle of nowhere by your self with no phone service all night if with no concerin to safety towards there employees.
bad,"They are very ""snakey"" Alot of CYA goes on there. To say the least its the good old boys club"
bad,HR was all over the place. They never got back to the interns regarding a job offer. Company culture was also something I didnt enjoy.
bad,They are sexist and if you don't play hockey you aren't worth anything to them.
bad,Fort Worth management team needs to be changed to make the area better for all.
bad,"Zero opoortunity for advancement."
bad,I started as a Welder 1 in April of 2015.  Honestly this place doesnt give any say for their workers. Too political and meetings that waste time. Emphasis only on salary employees.  Too many rules and regulations.  Wasteful manufacturing is what I call the place. Company has a revolving door policy.  Rather have cheap labor than pay well. Everyone hourly is replaceable .aaccording
bad,"They don't give you raises, they preach about moving up, but unless it's too transfer into another depot in the shop, they are hiring outside the company. They work you 16..17..20 hours and want you the next morning. Worked my coworker 134 hours in 1 week on his week on call! And still had to work Mon thru Fri the next week... Worked 65 that week. They don't care about your personal life and time spent at home. If someone at night calls in sick... They make someone that has already worked a 12..13..14 hour day during the day.. Stay that night as well... And show up the next morning and hope he doesn't call in sick again! Hr is there... But it's mostly just a show... They back the manager over the worker any day. Pay is lowest bw top 5 oilfield companies, you have to work 60 hours a week to make decent money."
bad,Work load was very unstable.management was quick to point fingers when something went wrong even when it was their mistake.  Employees were very good to work with.
bad,It was hard labor with a CDL you were expected to jump up and go at a minutes notice in the heat the rain the snow and start swinging a sledge hammer and carrying steel pipes and erecting frack site
bad,in the twelve months that I was there nobody approached me to welcome me or enquire how I was. The culture was poor and there was no inter-department connection.
bad,From the beginning apprentices are not told at their interview they will be doing rotating shift work (6.30am start early shift and midnight finish late shift). I would not recommend anyone's child to travel back from work at midnight. Very risky behind the wheel for anyone feeling tired from a company that drains all energy from you. The company is very slow and inefficient with many documentation errors. Their test equipment appears to have major creation and support problems which could end the company of all profits. There is a sloping shoulders culture where problems are thrown around with lots of meetings producing a blame culture. I have been on some good company trips abroad and have been head hunted by other companies. There is a wide gap work culture between the shop floor and the offices. Apparently the shop floor staff had their flexible hours discontinued so the day staff have to start work at a fixed 7.30am. No good if you have a young family to look after.
bad,"My employment at GE was a work from home environment, I travelled to all regions of the earth on many different projects, Installing GE equipment as well as repairing."
bad,"Baker used to be a great company to work with. However there are so many changes in the company, especially when it was bought by GE. Low pay, cut benefit and poor management."
bad,"I was laid off after 7 months, due to a shortage of work. They couldn't keep me busy enough to justify keeping me employed. This happened shortly after the merger with GE Oil & Gas."
bad,"Start of day is about an hour of meetings and waiting for work. Once we get product to work on we wait on crane operators. "
bad,"Working for GE was difficult, as 80% of the workers were not full-time, and therefore did not receive benefits or even job security. The environment was stressful, to say the least, and the company itself was extremely disorganized and chaotic. Overall, I would never recommend this company to anyone, and I certainly would not work there again."
bad,This company was in the process of a merger and was cutting back all resources including contractors. As a result all the existing resources were depleted and work began increasing difficult to make time lines.
bad,"This company is an example of how the share holders dictate how a company is to be run to the ruling class in Houston.  They do not car about the people, advancement, work culture.  Pay is good but management is terrible.  This also goes for the local managers, most of those who do not care and are only interested in keeping their own jobs."
bad,"Working in the field for Baker Hughes is similar to what purgatory is described. As soon as the industry began to slow down management took swift action to reduce compensation and cut the amount of employees while increasing the workload on who was left. Now with less time off and reduced pay the announcement was made that the employees are about to get yet another cut. This is a company that is also bringing in employees from other countries and giving them free room and board as well as higher compensation than the American workers to show they have a diverse work force."
bad,I cant say that the whole company was bad to work for but the shop I worked in lacked leadership and back bone and was not worth being a part of. Other wise the pay was good
bad,"This is the proverbial old boys club.  Management is so focused on appeasing the overlords in Houston, they have lost touch with their  customers and workers.  Any thoughts about progressing in the company should be dismissed.  They promote their friends and neglect those who show potential and talent.  I personally saw someone (friend of manager and team lead) quit, only to be hired back - promoted."
bad,It is a difficult place to work.  Management direction isn't clear.  Reporting structures are strange.  Responsibilities are not well understood
bad,in a typical day I was responsible for the proper operation of frac equipment . the day to day training of EOs on my crew .Im self motivated and myself and my co-workers got along great. The hardest part of my job was management in 4years we had 5 DM each having deferent goals . The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the EOs training them on equipment . Making sure they new what they where doing and how to trouble shoot
bad,"Worked outside one on one with customers to provide the best outcome of you job. I learned to run various types of equipment and they trained me as much as they could and what they couldn't i learned on my own hands on. Management was always 50/50, they had good supervisors and some who throw you to the wolfs. Communication between management was not the best and most of the time you were left in the dark. The best i have to say was when you called they always picked up or called you back to help you. The hardest part of the job was working far form home all the time and not being able to progress upwards to better a career unless you were favored. I enjoyed meeting new people and learning about how others do the job. No bonus programs were in place for field hands."
bad,"Management is overbearing and insulting.  Threatened physically.  Coworkers were great.  Customers were typical customers.  Wants everything now.  All-in-all they were okay though."
bad,"hours at one point were great but are now looking to cut hours and possibly employees. management is all about the ""good old boys"" club. advancement is almost impossible"
bad,"The Baytown plant has had approximately 5 plant managers in the last 8 years, with each one of these managers trying to put their own signature on the way that the plant should function,without consulting with the experienced operators of the plant. Thus creating an atmosphere of feeling less than valued for everyone"
bad,"I worked at the Trinity warehouse for fours years. I was a driver. This is not a driving job. 20% driving. 80% manual labor. One man show. Go to rigs, stack pallets and drums. Do rig moves. Do all the work while contract drivers sit and watch.Back bite coworkers. Management are buddies with office personal. Drivers are bottom end here."
bad,"This company will work a person 100 a week, swap you from nights to days, have you go from bay to bay, and then after they work you into the ground if you make a mistake they will fire you without batting an eye.  They break OSHA rules, and their own in house safety rules by having you work on shifts alone, and not fix pot holes in the yard where heavy equipment is being drove.  It's a good old boy system where if you haven't gone to school with your manager you can expect to be overlooked for promotions.  Managers will sign off on hours not worked by their buddies, and then put you on the ""get rid of list"" if you question hours listed by fellow employees. Managers also take kick backs from subcontractors such as hot shot teams and will instruct their team members to call certain sub-contractors first. This was my first job in the oil energy industry and after this experience it will be the last.  They will promise you all kinds of benefits knowing good and well their turn over rate is extremely high and an employee will never receive benefits such as pension and being vested."
bad,"Work day included preparing customer and overall revenue and market share reports for account managers; assisted sales manager and area manager with plan and presentations; organized customer events; followed rig count to ensure accuracy and requested explanations for extreme changes in rig counts; when rifs started in 2008, I was performing five different jobs due to the layoffs. My managers were then relocated and shortly thereafter, and I had been assigned the admin assistant position to the marketing director in wellbore construction. Shorlty after the relocation of my supervisors, I was laid off so the area operations manager could hire his admin's daughter. It was a power play. No other managers in the area had been relocated...and this particular manager wanted control over the events in the area, even though he was in operations and not marketing. Hence, my managers were relocated and I was laid off so he could have control over customer events and so that he could hire his admin's 19 year old daughter. I had been working approximately 80 hours per week to keep up with all the responsibilites assigned to me after all the RIFS. The new management in the area does not value dedicated, hard working employees, especially if you are female and over 40...they have not hired any female over 40 in the last three years."
bad,"It was so sad to see them let go of all the folks with longevity, knowledge and experience. People that were not at retirement age yet. Apparently this is something they've always done as an elderly gentleman told me they did the same thing in the 80's, then again in the 90's."
bad,Toxic work culture. No room for advancement. Management does not follow through and is only looking for their next promotion. Work life balance is non existent.
bad,"very challenging , great team but lack of communication and lack of appreciation with huge micromanagement from the HQ ."
bad,"GE was great till Baker Hughes took over then starded the layoff, cutting hours, and benefits got crazy expensive, no training was so ever or not anyone to lead some time of direction."
bad,It used to be a good company but since GE took over the culture changed.  There is no work life balance.  There is a divide between the GE and the Baker Employees.
bad,"This is possibly division specific, but management has little to no care for their employees.  Been on the road for two months straight and want a couple days off? No, they want you in the shop the next day, if not the same day if your flight lands early enough."
bad,"There were too many changes in management.  Each new manager had their own ideas how things should be run.  There was too much time spent learning their ways or in meetings or dealing with people who knew nothing about the job a person did but was trying to make changes.  It was hard to concentrate on my job. After the merger, the stress level increased as the layoffs began."
bad,"Post the merger, there have been many layoffs, and overall morale is very low.  There is friction between the legacy Baker Hughes and legacy GE employees.  People are more concerned about protecting themselves than delivering.  The workforce is very lean, so the responsibilities of employees is overwhelming."
bad,"Modelling on Creo Parametric and using Teamcenter to store data, learned an extensive amount about Trees and other Subsea products & systems, also hydraulic and electrical schematics."
bad,"When I first joined Baker Hughes in 2000, it was an excellent place to work.  Great benefits, flexible hours, etc.  However, after the 2008 recession, the company changed leadership and the goal appeared to be to do whatever was necessary to sell the company.  Employees were given instruction without the authority to follow-through.  Management was hired or promoted to weaken the company's market position.  This led to the attempted purchase by Halliburton and eventual purchase by GE."

bad,"This company has gone through major changes in the past couple of years and is continuing.  After the purchase from Halliburton did not go through and  the purchase from GE, this company will now be sold again.  GE has announced that they will sell off the newly formed company BHGE."
bad,"AWS and working from home were great perks.  Their health insurance packages are better than most.  Enjoyed the people I worked with.  No advancement internally.  Management lacking knowledge of the product, and devoid of leadership skills.  Certain individuals in management positions allowed to publicly bully subordinates with no repercussions.  The best part of the job was the people I worked with, the hardest part was dealing with management."
bad,"Don't do it.  Find somewhere else to work.  The oilfield has much better opportunities than a this place.  Places that will treat you like you matter, and pay you what you're worth."
bad,"I did not enjoy this job for the most part, however I did work with some really great people. I was not treated well by management .... I felt he was constantly looking down his nose at me, so I was always feeling uncomfortable. There really wasn't enough work for me to stay busy"
bad,"No clear direction on how to achieve the goals established by top management. The long term plans changed every six months, so in reality no long term plans. A lot of bureaucracy to take decisions"
bad,During my 2 and a half years at baker we had 3 shop supervisors and at least 5 shop leads and it was chaotic and unorganized. the 1st shift worked 8 hrs and the 2nd was left with all the work and worked anywhere from 8 to 16 a day
bad,"The hardest job here is not much job to do. Hence, a small thing unlucky happen will be treated become a disaster. Many people can not withstand the tension and have look for other environment. However, When you work here, You have very good opportunity to show up your friendship at work place. You will learn a lot of soft skill and how to survive in crisis situation"
bad,Pay and benefits were good. Management was horrible and the culture was horrible to be around. I would not suggest working for this company unless money is your only motive.
bad,Well as you walk in the door you begin to wonder how the day shift has screwed you over. They didn't do their jobs and their supervisors didn't make sure they were working. Daily I'd walk in and find people sleeping. To question the motives of the shift supervisors would almost certainly get you walked out the door. It is a buddy based department. Certain people could get away with murder while people like myself who worked hard everyday gets walked out the door. I wouldn't work for them again if i got a $100 and hour raise.
bad,"Maybe this was just my part of the organization however it seems that for a company as large and presumably prestigious as Baker Hughes there were SO may inadequate areas from poor management to poor/lack of communication to broken processes to non-acceptance of new ideas or accountability."
bad,"Very little work discipline due to the 3 managers not wanting to hurt anyone's feelings, which may cause them to quit/leave for the competition. CH workers acted as primadonnas and refused proper tagging and maintenance reports as required by the aforementioned managers (no enforcement).Constantly borrowing tools from shop and returning them filthy, if at all. It felt as if I was running a tool crib instead of a repair shop. CH workers refused to take proper care of their tools and do necessary maintenance of tools and equipment."
bad,"Repetitive daily work"
bad,"Safety and over time was great ,but it seemed like the team culture was but everyone was out for them self .baker hughes sold out rig underneath us"
bad,mostly work independent with poor communication from management. Work is through a peronnel agency providing no job security.
bad,Company has lost it's way since announcement of takeover. It would seem that the foxes have been put in charge of the hen house.
bad,This is a decent place to work if you are single and have no family as it is a oilfield job and with these types of companies the job comes first above all else. If you have no reason to be home then this might be the place for you cause you could go to work one day and not return home for a few days.
bad,"Good Old-Boy syndrome. For the most part, promotions are base on who you know."
bad,"no comment, I hated working for my boss, it was a hostile work environment from the beginning."
bad,Not your first choice of place to work for. The managers are bullies are they operate with lies and threats which i am sure is illegal. They do not care about your personal development or career advancement. The company lacks culture or a backbone. Managers running wild and HR department that is usually controlled or influenced by this same usually unqualified management team
bad,"OT  is required most days "
bad,"Basically this company was a great place to work at, however constant change has turned the company and personnel into a rudderless vessel. Pay is below other similar companies and BHI believes you should just accept this because it is a privilege to work for BHI. The company used to have a family atmosphere, however the younger generation and consistent change has turned this organization into a ""everyone for themselves"" company. HR within the company is mixed, but largely they are incompetent and can;t seem to run the organization the way it should be run. They basically do surveys and the employees tell them whats wrong, but they just ignore it. Sometimes it isn't about the money. Management opportunities and advancement are limited unless you are willing to move to Houston, if not forget about it. So basically you have 2/3 of the employees leaving or already have left due to mis-management at the top and opportunist backstabbers at the bottom. Truly sad."
bad,Was lied to about what the job truly was and hours it required compared to pay compensation
bad,"answering phone calls, dipatching drivers on their jobs, making yard calls for drivers, working in powerview and solv. recieving call orders from company man on rigs. taking orders for cement jobs for drivers.drecting calls to proper departments. directing deliveries to bulk plant.taking care of drivers logs.Did alot of data entry. i learned alot about multi tasking and taking time with drivers.Learning entrys in powerview system. Got along real good with everyone.Hardest part of day when getting several job at one time, and phone ringing off the wall.Enjoying visiting with drivers and enjoying learning new system for dispatching."
bad,A company with high standards of confidentiality & I will keep it that way.
bad,"Although short and long term disability are included, I advise you not to use should you be hired by Baker Hughes. Should you use any for of disability, expect to be terminated while on leave. This happened to me and the company gave me no choice but to go on disability due to getting sick in their facility and then promptly terminated me. Loved my team and loved my manager. All you are is a number. If being a number is OK with you, knock yourself out, just do not get sick."
bad,Employees are not treated properly. so many management flaws in the company. Requirements change very often after the final product is developed. No friendly nature
bad,The job is good. They do take care of their employees. Weather effects a lot of work time. As a single dad it just isn’t the job for me. I need to be home more with my family.
bad,Baker Hughes is a nice place to work at. Their benefit and pay are good. But poor management and a lot of favoritism. They choose who they like to help moved them up and forget about others hard workers.
bad,"Management cannot solve problems, and there are certainly no leaders here. Claremore has a toxic culture that everyone gets dragged into.  The company does not trust its employees and attempts to micro manage, resulting in lost customers and continuous failure."
bad,Pays well but life is hard when you are away from family. its hard not to go crazy when you are working with people who all think that they are badasses simply because they hold a big wrench and get dirty.
bad,Kindly note that I was an intern back then and the day to day activities changed on a daily basis as I was trying to learn new things every day also to mention that this was an internship and not an actual job.
bad,BHI changed from employee focused 3 years ago; this is unfortunate Baker used to be a great company to work for.  Hopefully they will realize this one day soon and switch back to the old way of running things.
bad,It was good to work as an electronics technician at bhi.   It is oilfield related and it is not very stable as an employer.  in 2014 there were roughly 60 thousand employees and in 2018 there are roughly 30 thousand employees.
bad,"Acquisitions make this a difficult place to work.  Two cultures, GE taking lead.  GE has a culture in IT that is at odds with Baker Hughes.  No advancement opportunities."
bad,"The oilfield is still primarily a man's field and they make sure you are aware of that. I am trying not to be negative here, but this company really left a bad taste. Not the company really, but the management at this particular branch."
bad,"load trucks. tidy yard areas  , move stock , move subsea frames to different areas for building. Package items for shipping to worldwide destinations."
bad,"Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and also customer entertainment. "
bad,"If you are not in the buddy network you will not advance or enjoy your job at all. If you intend on doing what's best for the business and not catering to the designated ones, you will be ousted and gotten ride of. Positions are assigned by the branch manager, not by who is most qualified for the position. You are not allowed to bring up failures or breakdowns in processes, because it is taken personally by the department manager. Then you have a ""I'll get you back"" war on your hands to deal with everyday. Not a good place to work at all."
bad,My introduction to the oil & gas industry was as a mudlogger in the Bass Strait of southern Australia.After a time there I transferred to the North Sea in the United Kingdom. The training at their office was informative. Some of the data engineers were approachable.
bad,The company I worked for was bought by Baker. Within months it was apparent they were running it into the ground. Management had no clue what we did or how we did it.
bad,"Sr Sales Manager for south Texas. Put heart and soul in to this company for many years just be laid off with out reason. Brought in of 40 million in sales, When baker Hughes took over they laid off all the sales staff."
bad,"Do not appreciate independant thinking and especially having an opinion different from ""the boss"".  This is probably just the ""oil & gas division though as it is new and has leadership from mega companies across the industry with very little of its own identity yet."
bad,"The company is in a very cyclical industry with a lot of cost pressure.  Lay offs are common.  Salaries are average or below market average.  Leadership is focused on itself too much.  Even though they may tell you what you want to here, the bottom line is it is not genuine.  "
bad,"For as large a company as GE is, you figured they'd have their Management levels and staffing complete. No proper management, no support on any level of the business, and everyone just wanted to play the blame game."
bad,"No definite work time frame (you work till the job is done mentality). Managers do not care about your personal life at all. You work!!!"
bad,"There's very little potential for advancement unless you are a male engineer. Some groups may be good, but some are not friendly with no sense of being part of the same team and help each other."
bad,"The people on shop Floor were Great to work with. There was a select few that were difficult to work with. They would hire people with no Construction Experiences ,or with some trade value. Management was always constantly changing. Two things that lead to a Train wreck, waiting to happen. they just layoff 150 people."
bad,"GE Oil & Gas in Schertz was a very difficult place to work from a work-life balance perspective.  There were many long days and weekends that were required to get the newly acquired Salof business up to speed.  There was also the challenge of having the primary customer co-located with you on site.  Often times it made it very difficult to focus on execution.  Additionally, the executive level leadership team went through and has since gone through a couple of changes which made it very difficult to have a sense of consistency or vision."
bad,"When the energy sector is up, it can be a fun place to work.  As soon as there is a downturn, however, Leadership is extremely prone to drastic workforce reductions, including personnel that have the highest tenure and shown the most loyalty, through good times and bad."
bad,"Ge purchased Cameron Inc. in 2014.  The transition has been a little rough.  The company is so big, and it kind of makes you feel that you are just a number on a spreadsheet."
bad,The down turn in the industry coupled with the impending merger of Baker Hughes and Halliburton made 2014 and 2015 difficult times to work in this environment.  Co-Workers and Managers made the situation bearable.  It was not like this in the past. Baker used to be a really great place to work and I loved my job. I am sure it will be great again.
bad,"I liked it, some co workers were not fun, customer service was really fun, go to understand how to buy your first paor of boots,"
bad,"SAP package for accounting."
bad,It is a good place to gain a good foundation in the oilfield with exposure to work all around the world.  But the culture of the feast or famine can be pretty cut throat.
bad,"20 hour days get old fast, especially when your days off finally come and you end up having to work. Pay was good but you never have time to enjoy it"
bad,"standard 12 hour days, learned a lot at no extra benefit, management takes about  6 months to get anything done within the company, but my co-workers are great people to be around"
bad,I when to class for little over 3 and 1/2 weeks pass all the class stuff then was laid off about 200 hundred of us
bad,"Good old boy. Does a lot of outsourcing and ""importing."" Very poorly managed."
bad,average. you can get opportunities in this big company worldwide though.
bad,Baker once was an excellent place to work...but recent series of reorgs have really turned off much of the work force. There seems to be no vision...no innovation...and no motivation...
bad,Baker was a human resources run company. as a manager you were not allowed to coach the employees. you were stuck in the office doing reports all day no chance to interact with your fellow team mates. workplace culture was not very good it almost seemed like you were rewarded for turning in other employees.
bad,Company is average in policy and politics. All employees are not equally compensated for the same job and work experience.  Hardest workers are often overlooked as they are too busy for volunteer activities and projects.
bad,"Baker Hughes wireline has really missed the opportunity to thrive in todays market, due to corporate mismanagement. I see nothing but bad things for the future for this division of the company."
bad,Bhge or ge o&g has managers that don't know how to do the work they are over. It's annoying and aggravating.  Benefits are going to be doubling Jan 1 2019.
bad,"Back breaking labor."
bad,"Very little time off and expected to go above and beyond while getting cutbacks, that's no life. The job itself is good but upper management makes it hard for the little man that keeps the company afloat"
bad,"This a perfect job to get trained and learn and get experience."
bad,Baker Hughes is an oil field extractor of oil and gas reserves.  It partners with several other firms that compliment its duties in the field.  Be expected to work long hours performing those duties.
bad,"Prior to the acquisition by GE, Baker was a fair company to work for with opportunities but after the merger the politics became apparent in the everyday work environment."
bad,BHI is a great company to work for. With the acquisition by GE it is yet to be seen what the company culture will turn out to be. Stressful and competitive work environment.
bad,I felt stressful since receiving a new manager who was intimidating with the requirements of the position which were made from his perception and not necessarily from the position with the position. I felt I was being singled out as this manager treated me as a servant where no other managers treated employees as this.
bad,"The poor management of this facility has brought this facility to its knees, allowing production to be slow and of poor quality. All the degrees they had in one room and not one of them understood the scope of work to be performed."
bad,challenging and stressful. Great employees but burnt out. Safety is compromised when it comes to get equipment out the door. Morals and ethics by the upper management team is questionable.
bad,"Upper management doesn't have a clue about the oil and gas industry. Was more worried about the making money than putting out a quality product. Workers had good ideas but because we didn't have a college degree, we didn't know what we were doing. GE constantly put people that didn't have a clue how to do the job in positions they weren't qualified for."
bad,Constant changes in management or leadership can cause issues in understanding goals and paths to success. Conflicts between departments or groups tend to arise with little support to resolution due to decisive leadership.
bad,"-A typical day at work can be very slow or very hectic with nothing in between depending on your role. What's nice is, usually, you go in at 8 and leave at 5 and nothing is expected of you before or after."
bad,"Bottom-line driven at the expense of investing in employees such as training, and investing in equipment.  Used all of the money from Halliburton (failed merger) and paid down debt and bought $1.5B of stock.  No long term investment in the company, only short term stock price increase due to the buyback."
bad,Experience doesn't count in BHI. Qualification counts to some degree. Most important is not your work but how you pretend to work and who you know. You will not move up the ladder unless you have a godfather. Lot of muscle no strength.
bad,"A typical day at GE work - Engineering Department needs serious improvement on professionalism. Managers and Colleagues use harsh words to be hostile with other co-workers, bad language everyday.  It makes you feel toxic deeply. "
bad,A company built of silos that are only as functional as the local leadership.  Overall there is a lack of accountability and a lack of urgency.  Promises were made to many in different roles and many were not followed through.
bad,Difficult work culture and environment overall. People are set in there ways and not open to change or new ideas. Very petty events occur behind the scenes with sabotage a very real problem. Many layers of management with difficulty getting cooperation between departments.
bad,Too many managers with nothing to do interfering with productivity.  A corporate culture that focuses on pleasing middle management over pleasing clients.  Not a good business model.
bad,"I was on call 24/7 for fifteen days at a time. I would come in at all times of the day and night. Would get equipment ready for job. once everything was ready, I would drive to rig location and start rigging up iron. After rigging up we would have a pre-job safety meeting. After safety meeting we would pump the job. After job we would rig down iron. After rigging down we would drive back to the yard. Lastly we would take care of equipment and go home. The main issue I had with this company was most of the management was lazy, had no accountability, and absolutely no leadership from the supervisor level on the crew that I worked with. The hardest part of the job was the lack of hours and time spent away from family."
bad,"This review is aimed at the Baker Hughes office Abu Dhabi and it does not reflect the overall culture of Baker Hughes but instead what any person would find in that particular location."
bad,"0 job security,you learn a lot but wit less possibility for you to exercise it."
bad,"I started working at BHI 10 years ago.  At that time it was a great place to work that cared about their employees."
bad,"I was recruited by GE Oil and Gas to further my career and have better benefits then I did at the independent I was working for. Six months into working for them, they shut down our branch and was forced to work, of all places, in Williston, N.D.  Rotating out of North Dakota was horrible on my home life. I basically lived in Williston and visited home. Pay was great, but that's about it. During a Medical Leave, they decided to unlawfully terminate my employment. I never received my personal belongings such as my personal tools, clothes and my nice T.V. that my wife had bought and shipped to me for Christmas. It has been very difficult for me to try and find a job due to the tag of termination stamped on me though I was on FMLA approved leave."
bad,"•	Use of AutoCAD mechanical design software to draw, design, generate, amend and produce engineering drawings alongside general arrangement drawings and schematic diagrams."
bad,Good if you want to work hard and make some money. Long hours never know where you are going to be. Have to share rooms with other workers so not much privacy. Mentally and physically demanding.
bad,Company has a vast number of experienced hands and several opportunities for advancement.  However the company kept you working in the field for extended periods of time (60 plus days).
bad,"Long hours are required with no acknowledgment of personal sacrifice. Expectations are 24 / 7, nights and weekends without compensation, salary covers it... They use you then loose you"
bad,"Great training programs. However, management is not on the same page. Numerous employees skirting by because there is very little accountability."
bad,Great place to learn your way until management becomes in a bind with their management.
bad,"Maintain and repair tractors and trailers, as well as Fracturing equipment. The maintenance supervisor is incredibly smart and can help you through any situation that could possibly be wrong with any of the Fracturing equipment. Most of the personnel hired on are non experienced hands which in terms makes the job seem harder than it relatively is. The most enjoyable part of the job would be working with a knowledgeable crew that is willing to go above and beyond their respectful duties to ensure better job quality."
bad,"I would line the crews out to stay busy most of the day till we ran out of material."
bad,"One thing you can know for sure is that you will see people come and go.  Despite having quality employees HR leadership will change roles like they change their underwear.  The core values are a joke.  The only people that thrive at BHI are the ones who kiss up to the incompetent leadership, and spend their time drinking and socializing.  Rather than support the people who actually do the work, they are alienated and isolated from opportunities to advance.  So, they RIF the workers and keep the whiners.  They let people go with no card or concern for their livelihood.  The company will always be ""Baker"" who, and be last in the game because they do not exhibit any integrity, leadership, performance, teamwork or courage when doing the right thing.  So, much for their employees being their greatest assests.  The one thing you know for sure is that it's not what you know, but who you know that will keep you employed at BHI."
bad,eu gostaria de ser mas valorizado nessa empresa mas não fui devido as responssabilidades que me era competente.
bad,For a company as big as BH to lay people off on the pressure pumping side and not offer any positions in other divisions of the company that need people shows a lack of forethought on the company. It is long past time for a changing of upper management a person should not be able to get a job with the competition the day after being laid off.
bad,An international company the values own employees & society & culture
bad,"I was paid well, but the number of hours I was asked to put in each week made this a difficult job. Resources were hard to come by making the job frustrating."
bad,"Pay is below par, no room for advancement, stagnent work environment. I have seen the company change so much in the past decade. It is far from what it once was."
bad,"Company has endured a failed M&A with Halliburton, a historical oil crisis and a very confusing merge (acquisition?) with (by) GE. Its identity has been undermined and employee moral are in an all-time low. A new matrix organization, led mainly by GE Executives worsens the situation. GE's benefits packages are less competitive than legacy-Baker or the competitors"
bad,stressful organization. lots of favoritism. watch your back. people will throw you under the bus at every opportunity. nice campus though. but it was the most miserable bunch of people i have ever worked with.
bad,Work employees too hard.  Little opportunity for advancement.  No effective leadership.  Employees taking problems to their supervisors get threatened with their jobs.
bad,"Good people to work with at Dickinson Lufkin office.  However, overall management did not support EHS culture.  They were more concerned about money and budget."
bad,'Im a contractor. I only mobilize when there is a project or trainnings. Its a disadvantage when i'm a contractor i dont have benefits. At first i thought i will get a raise when you do a good job. Every year they are deducting salary from workers.
bad,I met some great people and enjoyed my time there. I was frustrated and so were my colleagues with the inattention to some of our concerns with quality issues we noted. The quality manager was replaced however the changes were too late and not thorough enough.
bad,what ever happened to just Straight up applying all these sites want passwords Now before you even can apply set up account etc
bad,"After doing my best to be a team player, I was let go after 18 years. I am a hard-worker and willing to take on whatever is necessary to keep my shop going. I really liked the hard work and varied opportunities. It is really too bad that they left me with such a sour taste for corporate life."
bad,"A typical day, get a cart with assembly components and panels, pull wiring diagrams and assembly drawings up on computer,work.The hardest part of the job was collecting all the information need,sometimes the prints were unpublished as of the date of production,it did teach patience."
bad,"I loved working here and the people that I worked with. We were a family. Now we are all looking for employment elsewhere. With the downturn in the Oil & Gas industry, the management of the company has started making decisions that will ultimately lead to the death of a once great company"
bad,"INTEVEP is an institution with lots of room for improvement,nevertheless, to improve, the institution must have the willingness to do so.In this case, there is no will."
bad,You get to work with a great bunch of people. The only drawback is the management does nothing to improve the poor moral. The shop is the cleanest machine shop I've ever seen with high focus on safety.
bad,"I enjoy working with the people in my office. I help wherever possible and will do anything within my scope to help. If I don't personally know the answer I seek out people in Corporate positions that can help. "
bad,"The first week I started with the company myself and another new employee literally walked around the workshop with our hands in our pockets wondering who was going to give us direction! No formal training program. most of the seasoned techs didn't want to work with the newbies. after a few weeks of frustration all the new techs were sent to Canada for formal training on the tools that we were hired for. management in Houston was missing in action. the Houston techs hated us because we flew to our jobsites while they drove all over the country with a pickup and trailer. in the field we regularly worked 12 to sometimes over 20 hour days. "
bad,"Es buena escuela tanto en cultura de manufactura diversas oportunidades de mejora, inyectan ganas de superación y generan oportunidades para el crecimiento del personal."
bad,I was here to setup UCS and Baker Hughes wasn't my employee. Work culture was a great place.
bad,"It was a good place to work. That was until we got laid off. Ifigured as big of a company Baker Hughes is, we'd have a job no matter what. After some management changes within our district, they decided to close our department and lay us off. I will never work for Baker Hughes again. I stayed when others jumped ship and that was our reward."
bad,"Was told i could transfer but was not able to for two years after hire."
bad,"Baker Hughes is a lot like other fracking companies with one exception. The actual follow thru on their own safety protocols. After two separate incidents that led to explosions on the wellhead, I turned in my two week notice. I choose not to put myself at risk anymore in the short time I was there."
bad,GE was new to the oil and Gas space and they bought a company that did not have contractual agreements buttoned down with client.  Had lots of quality issues.
bad,did not like the environment with the co-worker. Manager was working off-shore and handling things from there. overall all company is good to work with.
bad,Way too top heavy with poor management. They don't employ the right personnel because they don't pay as well as other near by offices. Processes are still preventing anything from getting done in a reasonable time. Most low level employees are great to work with but management over works everyone.
bad,toujours à la recherche des restructurations pour s'adapter au marché
bad,"GE acquired Bently Nevada almost 12 years ago. Bently's products are widely recognized in the market as top of the line which have gained a lot of loyal customers married to the brand."
bad,"La empresa se esta cayendo a pedazos desde la fusión con Halliburton, no aumentan los sueldos hace más de un año, se bajo el presupuesto hasta el limite de no tener fiesta de fin de año."
bad,"My Initial Experience with Baker Hughes was very positive. I had just left me former company for financial reasons and also the promise of beginning a new project and starting a new page in my career with the potential for progression within a new company."
bad,the personnel that work there are great. The down side is the training is not all that good. new equipment and comes out before any type of training. is a learn as we go. Another bad thing about the company is it's not what you know but Who you know. the chances for advancement depend on who you're related to.or who you're really good friends with. other than that. We always stived to be the best company out here.
bad,"They worry more about the paper work and guardian cards from us than the actual job that is taking place"
bad,It a great company as long as your not in the oilfield business. When GE took over Hydril they changed the product that had shipped for 75 yr.and the changes where not well received by the market.
bad,"This company and job combination comes with great benefits.  It's a good company to build your resume/CV with.  The hourly pay is by far the lowest of the other big corporations.  The company almost never makes their completion deadline on any project.  I believe it has to do with the Lead Men, and their lack of knowledge; or the fact that 90% of the workers have a ""I get paid by the hour"" attitude.  The hardest part of the job is finding a teammate that's willing to work.  Most of the tasks require 2 individuals to complete (according to safety), so finding someone that knows what they're doing, is willing to learn, or doesn't take a 2 hour ""restroom"" break, is very difficult.  If you are hired on as an assembler, the only advancement opportunity you are give is to move to Test, and that doesn't include a pay raise.  It's said, once you're in the High Bay, there's no way out, especially if you're qualified/licensed in everything possible.  As far as your co-workers and Lead Men, it's like being back in high school.  The back stabbing, trash talking, no camaraderie etc.. I even think it may be worst than High School.  If you're wanting to work here, I recommend packing your own breakfast and lunch.  The cafe prices are extremely high, and the quality of food is horrible.  On top of the bad food, the cafeteria service is almost always late and never opens on time.  The management isn't bad, they do their best to take care of you and get the job done.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the work, there is just so much to be done, and some much learning that can occur.  If you"
bad,"Very slow decision making, very process oriented. Good Ethics but lack of professional growth. Not recommended at early stage of carrier."
bad,"realizo un turno de 12 hs mi trabajo lo considero importante para la industria petrolera ya que nuestro sistema de extraccion es muy rentable"
bad,"Work on Reactor plant on a shift rotation system, the job is very hands on and involves lots of manual labour. i enjoy working shifts days and nights."
bad,"Learned a lot about - building industrial IOT solutions, scaling these solutions, and the challenges of adoption of digital transformation in a traditional industry ."
bad,"It was a nice company to work in but the job security is zero. when I joined Baker in 2008 the culture, the management was excellent "
bad,"management has no clue on how to run the business. purely bureaucratic system in place. the company relies on italian mafia who does not consider customers as their source of paychecks, and they will never accept their mistakes"
bad,"I thought coming into the job I would work hard and get noticed and they would see my drive and ambition and help me advance. They did notice me, and I got better raises then those around me, but the raises were still not very large, and I was unable to move jobs no matter how qualified I was for the job. The best way to move up is to make friends with managers or be related to one."
bad,"a lot of long days but very inconsistent with hours,  It was a cool job it just could e run a lot better far as the organizing process. A lot of the supervisors should have had a lot of up to date training."
bad,"Managements whom did not have team leadership skills, whom didn't take the time to know their employees, putting themselves first, not show interest in the well being of the employees."
bad,"Lots of money/ No life . Learned that guys talk about eachother more than girls do. If you want to advance plan to be there for 15 years before anything will happen. "
bad,"Baker is a large company with Great benefits and supposedly a lot of advancement oppurtunities. My experience there indicated otherwise. While the benefits were good, the opportunity for advancement as a machinist was disappointing. As a new employee at my first machining job, I had only 2 weeks of training on the most challenging machine in the shop while experienced machinists had months. Intelligent, ambitious guys with ideas were only met with resistance when sharing them with other departments. A friend of mine tried to take advantage of the tuition reimbursement program and has completed 3 semesters and still has not been reimbursed. There are not many positions for advancement as a machinist. The few spots available were being filled with guys that were not the most qualified which sends a bad message to the stronger candidates eager to advance. There would be a lot more opportunity and a better environment if management would actually check on employees to see how they're doing or at the very least figure out what they are capable of. This job would be good for a machinist that doesn't want to add value to the company in any way other than machining a part."
bad,"working with defferent nationalitie ,cultures and archive alot in my carers"
bad,Great Place to get paid ..... Management lacks professionalism at yard i worked in and recruiter was misleading on some things
bad,was a good company just felt i had no security there as i was kept on a temp contract
bad,"Employees are more of a number than a person. The benefits are great, which is why I lasted there as long as I did. My coworkers were great, for the most part, but it is no surprise their turn over rate is so high."
bad,"Started this company with high hopes. Was promised lots of work and overtime. Never got any jobs, was always sitting at the yard, and could not get any hours."
bad,Some days are better than others. Alot of as contractors feel that we are being treated unfairly. My opinion is the management would treat their contractors better they would have a better work team.
bad,Great poeple to work with. Managment was fare. Took care of the workers. I advanced in the company. Was able to make decisions based on my experience in the field.
bad,The people I worked with were awesome but the management and higher at GE isn't worth a darn. Would never work there again and wouldn't advise anyone to work there ever. WORST COMPANYI EVER WORKED FOR!!
bad,"Alright place to work.  They tend to keep a lot of extra dead weight (employees) around, and promote based on favorites, not performance. I would rate 4/10"
bad,Management pushes and pushes production workers to get things done but does not have a set process on how to do things. None of the departments work together as a whole team and it causes chaos and loss of productivity as well as overall moral
bad,"Not the best pay,when started was advised that moving up the ladder was an available option, however found out that was not the case.  Did provide decent training ."
bad,Enjoyed working with all co-workers. Inline Manager was great. Created quotes for outside sales team. Hardest part of day was worrying about being laid off.
bad,On call 24/7. Occasionally worked holidays but well compensated (before the merger and oil prices dropping by half). Now several lay-offs and hours cut.
bad,"Field staff at BHI wireline were a good bunch of guys.  There was a need for clearer direction from management.  The most satisfying part of this job was getting to a wellsite and taking charge of the job. However, there was also reams of paperwork associated with this."
bad,Was very hard to get on and job only lasted 6 months because of oil prices.Beware if oil prices go down everyone's job becomes at risk.
bad,"sucks, no time nothing, horrible"
bad,It is an unusual setting where much is expected of you. People are pretty friendly and its a fast paced environment.
bad,"Baker Hughes as a whole is a good place to be."
bad,"way under resources, unmanagable amount of work. Management have no solution for future planning. only solving temporary problem."
bad,little advancement
bad,Well my opinion would be that I did t not learn anything there other than no one wanted to teach you anything  because they were to scared to lose their postition instead of teaching someone so that they could have the chance to learn other equipment
bad,Good healthcare coverage. Immediate level of Management was good. Opportunity of Internal job transfers available but may be limited to Management level.
bad,"On call 24/7. Made it really impossible to have a life outside of work. I bought a new 14,000 boat that I never took out once because every time I called my supervisor to ask permission (yes, I had to do that because there was no phone coverage on the water) he said no, every time for 3 years. So it sat for 3 years until I sold it for less than half I bought it for. Great job if you're supporting a family that views you as a source of income and doesnt mind you being absent most of the time."
bad,"1:hard worker"
bad,"The was starting at 08.00 am with, a safety meeting and daily planning job. 30 mins after we start our job with filling safety papers and explaining to a team the job."
bad,I really enjoyed this job. I filled this out once already. I don't see why I need to fill this out twice. but this job was a great job. I had no issues. I learned a lot about safety. policies and procedures.
bad,Excelente ambiente de trabajo. la empresa invierte en la preparacion de su personal con la finalidad de lograr las metas en un ámbito de excelencia para la empresa para sus trabajadores y el medio ambiente.
bad,"-working at GE is flexible, I was working either from my Home or office."
bad,"I have been fortunate to experience great growth opportunities within GE, however, with my decision to relocate home to the UK, I find the  daily commute (up to 4 hours) to Bristol a waste of productive time. This along with the current Baker Hughes Merger, I find the long term security while attaining a moderate work/life balance is not achievable within GE at the moment."
bad,The job was fun and was good money but there was no home life.  The management did not care about anything but themselves making money.
bad,The management is lost they haven't gotten the idea the midland is a competitive market so their not offering a competitive wage. As an overall company I have no complaints the benefits are good advancement is great. but the midland wire line base is in shambles. Go mom and pop if you want to make the most money you possible
bad,everything was really nice.My contract assignment ended...
good,Where I worked it doesn't even exist anymore they sold off the part of the company that I worked for so I really have nothing much to review have a good day
good,"I was working hard in the company, also the company is very great. but there was a manger have a phobia on his chare, he thinks everybody is his enemy and going to have his position."
good,"The baker Hughes Plant I work/worked in was shift work, so you can imagine what that is like. They do not give you any notice for overtime but the expect you to do it."
good,They are all related. come in with a high wage cause youll never make any money. worked there 10 years and only moved up $4. its a buddy system.
good,"I learned a lot at Baker Hughes but training and management were"
good,"You will be drowning in whatever it is you do."
good,High Stress level. I learned the operation of pressure pumping.
good,"Decent place to work if your manager is worth anything.  Mine only cared about how many people’s jobs you could do instead of staffing up and getting shop staffed and wondered why paperwork backed up.  Then when it comes time, throwing you under the bus to save his own face. Work you to death and then throw you away replacing you with his friends he hired."
good,"Employer does not contribute to 401K anymore, too many chiefs, not enough indians. No one seems to realize you have to spend money to make money. No parts readily available"
good,Management style was to closely monitor (micro-manage) all employees thus morale in general was poor at least at this Baker Hughes location and in Accounting.
good,"No job security. You work hard but your job is secured based on who you know and not ""what you know"". No career development plan, everything is based on reference"
good,"Overtime when business is booming and straight time otherwise. Plenty of on the job training, excellent safety program. A team effort to meet company goals."
good,Baker Hughes has since merged with GE and I have heard that the culture is completely different and positive.
good,i didn't enjoy working for this company once the management was change. i was lied to by management and would never work at baker hughes artificial lift in midland tx again again
good,"Depending on the site, there is a wide variety of differences in each of the businesses.  The business is going to be transitioning in the next year - by June 2018."
good,"Unfortunately, things have changed culturally and functionally after the BHGE merger which has led to several leaders fleeing the organization. Folks have been placed into different roles without consideration of their expertise or existing programs"
good,"In Management positions today, there is really no certainty, direction or true guidance and the constant threat of a merger, disrupts all initiatives and delays response from management. BHI was  great company to work for, it had great people and leaders. Now with the insertion of former SLB employees in Top Management, the company has lost its essence and is now ran accountants that know nothing about people or the business."
good,"My time at this company was short lived.  I wish i could say more about the company, but I was only employed for about 4 months before I was laid off."
good,Co workers were great.  I could go on and on and on about things that were good and I just hope my experience was different from yours.
good,"Its a job, you are just a tool to get things done if your not the right tool they will find the one they like. lots of travel and many nights away from home, if you cant do that look somewhere else"
good,"Good ole boys clubs"
good,"When i started there, it paid the bills and when i quit, the manager didnt know what he was doing so i abandoned the ship before it sank. And a year after i left it did sink."
good,There is very nice process set for the designers to work on. And there is continuous advancement of your skill set. The senior peers are very encouraging.
good,"got plenty of hours, however management worked employees 30 plus hours with no relief in the shop. did not care how unsafe or tired they were. never gave the option to rest"
good,"High dangerous work place in Basra branch on Iraq,not bad meals, bad medical insurance , bad rooms for resident, my rate is just good company not more."
good,ge oil and gas in schertz tx plays favorites avoids giving raises and doesnt offer much incentive for meeting deadlines. atmosphere is tense because of upper management looking to fire someone
good,Good training given and also good benefits to choose from. Dislike lack of progress in grades due to current climate. Various product lines to choose from and be able to develop within the company.
good,"Dada la condicion actual de la industria petrolera ajustes han tenido que haber sido considerados y las transiciones no se realizaron en momentos debidos ocacionando un impacto negativo al negocio, no hubo compromiso para el crecimiento profesional de los trabajadores."
good,"Average company to work for, even there are good learning opportunities, there is no fair rewards as far as career advancement and compensations. "
good,"When oil industry is good it's good, when it's bad you can lose your job.  Most people there are great to be around and work with."
good,"Odiei a cultura do local."
good,No team effort there. Management is lacking in all areas. Co workers where all back stabbing and out for themselves. Training and getting info was very bad.
good,There were a number of things I liked best about that job. I enjoyed the level of open and direct communication. This moved things along quickly and few things were left unsaid. This meant that people had to detach themselves from the topic and not take comments personally or make personal comments. It was always about solving the business problems. Another thing I liked was your ability to learn new things and take on more responsibility. Everyone was in a constant state of growth.
good,"A typical day at work is Baker Hughes is in the field being a Field Technician. Being a Field Tech consists of maintaing all the equipment to ensure the customer is satisfied at all times with how the Hydraulic Fracturing process is going. It is a time consuming job with little time at home. I have learned various types of mechanical systems that apply to the oilfield, and how the Hydraulic Fracturing process works. This is where all my oilfield experience is at. The management system is good, although at times there is a serious lack of communication. The hardest part of the job is being away from home days at a time. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the satisfaction on the customers face when the job is going the way he or she wants it."
good,"On a toujours des journees de travail tres chargees,  tres peu d'opportunites s'offrent a nous, le management est assez correct,"
good,The oilfield business is an interesting place to work.  Learning about the pressure pumping was a great experience.
good,"to unload wagons, unpack crates process goods"
good,I work from 7 till 5 I job is ok I have good customers and I have bad
good,"Has become an incredibly stressful place to work. Manager is cutting headcount to extreme levels. Everyone is having to do multiple jobs at the same time as not enough operators to fill all positions,"
good,"Excellent Training, International Opportunities, Great HSE Culture, Good Benefits, Good Vacation Time, Competitive Salaries, Profit and shareholder driven."
good,"Outsourcing at is best, Fastly becoming the dollar store of the oil business, management has the ge, squeeze culture down pat. Relationships and experience are not of value here anymore."
good,"Poor listening skills, this company is all about making money, IT does not care about employees advancement, training, etc. Thee's a high turnover at this company."
good,"The branch I worked out closed. Some members of management were bullies. They liked to make fun of some of the less educated employees. A manager in particular favored a couple employees above everyone else. The favoritism was horrible. Luckily that manager eventually was fired, but it took a long time."
good,"I really don't have much to say here-- not relevant to next job posting."
good,"Great company to work for with an amazing safety culture.  Safety is at the forefront of everything that they do, and is supported from the top leadership down.  There is a lot of changes going on with the merger of Baker Hughes and GE, Oil and Gas, and with that comes new ideas."
good,"Baker Hughes it would have been an excellent company if we would of have a good management team, is sad to say that in the last year that I spent  working there we went thru 4 managers and none of them made any sense."
good,A lot of things need to be changed there. Management needs help. They need to hire a Plant manager. They also need to stop micromanaging the guys that do the actual work.
good,"no comments, I would like to keep it professional.  I work at Baker Hughes, a General Electric company because I they merged with Wood Group a few years ago."
good,The company worked everyone to the bone and then asked for more during the down turn. They will promise the world but ruin your heath.  US management does not care about Canadian employees
good,"Upper Management is more worried about bonus then getting Quality products produced. Their goal has been pushing Percent of work done on the whole project instead of working one train at a time fixing the redlines and other issues that arise such as insuring preservation and quality of work was done. Upper Management uses the supervisors and production workers as scape goats and does not take responsibility of their failures.  Future Problems will arise from there Indecisiveness on how to fix their quality issues and every worker is below me attitude. GE Oil and Gas Schertz TX has had two mass layoffs in one year one of around 150 in the beginning of the year and another of 80 on August 16, 2017 and no one from the upper management has been affected and will continue to cause problems for the company due to greed."
good,"It is what you expect from a major corporation. Managers have their favorites and if your aren't part of that group you really aren't considered for much. Was told by an assistant manager at one time that I should ""suck up to another assistant manager"" in order to get over time. Benefits are constantly decreasing as well as pay raises."
good,"A typical day at work would be communicating with everyone from Document Control, Engineers, Planners, Buyers etc. to make the Bill of Materials data matched the design and that we ordered the correct materials. As an ERP Coordinator I was involved with every aspect of the company."
good,"Employees are reminded onthly that they are employed ""at will"" and can be terminated at any time, for any or no reason. There is no promotion available, to progress, you must move to another company."
good,"the people who are on salary and work in the offices are out of touch with reality they expect you to produce as fast as their keyboards"
good,Hj em dia poucas pessoas e muito trabalho. Tem tido muitas demissões e com isso as pessoas que continuam na empresa tem que se sacrificar para fazer as coisas nas datas solicitadas.
good,Not so fun working for IT department. Hardest part of the job is you will have enough time for yourself if you are handling a IT project. They expect you to work 24*7 hrs.
good,"same as previous review that I had about Baker Hughes Australia, as it is basically the same company, but different location. Was able to travel and meet a lot of people and had a lot of opportunities."
good,Great co-workers and competitive pay. Benefits have fallen off over the years do to the oil industry. Needs a upper management over haul. Hours are hard to deal with unless you like rotating swing shifts. You never have the same days off every week and you switch from days to nights every week. Couldn't ask for a better select of co-workers.
good,Política pobre. Com péssimos gestores. Supervisão não é profissional.
good,"laid back workplace, challenging, control of career path. annual raises are nice, holidays off are good, communication needs to be better."
good,Good company to work for. Have great job oppertunities. Long travel for work and will be gone months at a time for work in the field. Slow to be promoted unless u know some in the company.
good,Working hours is Monday to Friday from 7.30 am to 4.30pm. It is a great experience working in a high pace work environment. We were working ad team to make sure all the task are completed on timely manner. The most enjoyable part is getting 4 flex days a year.  the flex day starts in April of one day off of each month.
good,"Very unorganized especially with the Halliburton merger taking place. Very unscheduled work schedule, could be out of town for very long stretches"
good,"Good money. Can quickly advance, but management takes their time on advancement. No work/life balance. Can be gone for 30-40 days straight and not much time off."
good,"Baker Hughes Inteq was a good company which got bought out by Halliburton. I worked in TX, LA, OK, AR and the Gulf of Mexico."
good,good place to work. really nice& professional people. looks like they just didn't change with the times. GE Announced that they are closing. Oh well
good,"Good opportunity to learn, wouldn't stay there long. It was obviously a man's club. Most women who work there are only in HR or Admin rolls."
good,I am relocating to Rockport TX and looking for a job in that area.
good,"Desorganizada, sem liderança."
good,The right hand does not know what the left hand is doing...I don't know how else to say it.
good,"Slow pace environment, I gained plenty of experience in SAP systeme while I was working at Baker Hughes. Over all the management was help full and good to work with."
good,Nothing specific to mention about this.  Very demanding job with very limited support or resources. Management focused on results but not involved in finding issues and help with proactive process improvement.
good,They were laying people off. No raises.  Losing work to our competitors .  The bad thing is the same people that are destroying Baker Hughes have moved over to Clariant oil services and are destroying it.
good,"review quotes and orders in engineering. create engineering designs and drawings for customer specific products."
good,Hard work.  Benefit is that you gain experience needed for the next step - whatever that may be.  Pay is decent for Salaried but you will earn it.  Good stepping stone but not a final destination.
good,low to mid level management is not really good. BHI to BHGE and so a lot of changes. some changes are good but some are not. hopefully they can keep good people.
good,worked long days building and autilizing down hole well fracking equipment. the job was physically demanding as well as challenging.a very dangerous job
good,Not an ideal place for top performers who value autonomy. A lack of transparency also leads to a lot of frustration from the managers and employees - very hierarchical.
good,"I've worked here a year and there wasn't a rush on advancement to full time. And its the oilfield, there wasn't a warning when had the lay off. If you want job security I wouldn't commit to them as a career opportunity."
good,"Depending on your manager, you might do very little every day. In other circumstances, you carry the load for the rest of the department."
good,I loved it there until I got to a level where I was put into a direct reporting position with a terrible manager who seemed to be all about the drama!
good,"As a contract employee, I received the exact same treatment as any other employee with the exception that I was not offered any benefits and did not get any paid holidays. I was allowed to work extra hours to compensate the hours I would have lost during an unpaid holiday, but that was the extent of my benefits. As a contract employee, I am going to be one of the first let go if something goes south."
good,"during my time in GE OnG i experience a lots of changes around the company that affected my career, 5 different managers, lost all my team during those changes."
good,Good place to learn and add to your experience. You work on schedule which may impact your family life. You can leverage on the experiences of the old ones in the system.
good,Management focus over the last 5 years was to sell the company. They gave up on customer service. They forgot that the field was the revenue generating machine.
good,Quite Stressful as a Design Engineering Lead - Manager played favorite and didn't like to hear about new ideas. Good Company - just had a bad leader that was a micro-manager
good,"Management did not look out for their employees and the workers did not like to spend time out on the yard because we had to deal with them. it was always better on jobs because we would look out for each other and make sure we all did a great job for the company and for ourselves. we were like family and it was fun to work with the group we were in because we all had a respect for each other and we each pulled our own weight so our coworkers wouldn't work as hard and we took over when someone was tired or in pain, until management broke all the crews apart and thats when we started losing good people and then it wasn't a good place to be."
good,"Pelo tempo de empresa que tive, o ambiente é muito bom de se trabalhar, tivemos 3 gerências em 5 anos e a rotatividade de cargos dentro da empresa é grande, para quem tem graduação, consegue essa rotatividade, mas para quem é técnico fica um pouco difícil. Infelizmente fui demitido do quadro de funcionários por motivo de redução (RIF)."
good,Recent changes in management and company direction have changed company from a great place to work to a stressful environment. They used to pride themselves on winning business the honest way and standing by their employees. It has now become a place where you hear of greasy sales tactics and employees are always worried it may be their last day. No trust or respect from management towards employees. Other districts may be better.
good,Would only recommend if single and no family. Managment only covers for you if you spend weeks away and dont complain when your days off are cancelled
good,I was in charge of most daily operations from opening to closing end of day. Management was fair just the office personnel left something to be desired (very rude) with staff members but the best part was the customers.
good,"Good HR department, inexperienced management, good training opportunities.  The HR person assigned to me was very good at helping.  Management would give directive one day then change directive next day, trying to escape responsibility.  Training opportunities were many with company delivering available time to attend and complete."
good,There is a passion for restructuring. Most technical jobs are no longer part of the US branches and outsourced to Germany since there are stricter rules over there regarding layoffs. It is a pity to see such in-house knowledge and capability go waste.
good,"I Started in BHI as Field Engineer, i always remember those days where i made a  lot of friends."
good,"After having to wait all morning for a phone call to go at work you usually get the call by 1 pm to be ready to leave shop by 3pm after loading equipments on truck and trailer and had to drive for 12hrs to destination to realize that there was no communication between dispatch and the company man to let him/her know that i already been up for 20hrs  and by law needed 8hrs of duty before starting work again. In busy time its exhausting and tiring to work for a company that says that it cares about its employees and pushes them to work illegal hours to fit the needs of others."
good,"An individual is most lucky if his supervisor has the capacity and knowledge to support the work. During my 33 months on the job, I had 4 supervisors. The first and last were the best.  I really enjoyed every minute of what I do during their tenure."
good,"My Typical day at work was clocking in, getting samples of the mud we had in stock to check if the weight was were it needed to be. Loading trucks with mud to be sent out to rigs, transferring mud from tank to tank. I learned how to be responsible and communication skills. I got alone with all my co-workers and upper management. Hardest part of the job was being on call 24-7. I enjoyed most of all the people i worked with."
good,"I've been very fortunate that I've had several good managers that really care about their team.  Every day has different challenges; however, those challenges allow each of us to grow."
good,"HR Global is unaware of critical issues when transferring personnel internationally, particularly in Africa Region. Poor management and lack of communication leads to shortage of resources and lack of capability to provide proper accommodation to international employees."
good,"It was great working at GE oil and gas as the company encouraged work/life balance. However, I regret that the management was poorly conducted and too much of office politics to climb up the ladder."
good,"Worked offshore and Gulf coast alone with simpler MWD tools and in small teams with more complicated tools.  When the oil field was busy in 1997, could spend 25 days or more offshore, which meant higher pay, but no days off, had to be ready to respond to page to return offshore within 1 hour."
good,"Like any other day we are early risers and most times I skip bath in the morning, because I take my job seriously. During preparation (rigup) for a job it is quite hard and everyone is expected to put in his best. "
good,"Management only cared about themselves, if it made them look better by throwing you under the bus they wouldn't hesitate. Co-workers were great to work with. When oil prices are up they do tend to let people work OT. Management will receive their bonuses regardless, workers will not get squat. Considering management makes 60k a year or more with 10k+ bonuses, shop workers only got about 1000-2000 depending on years worked there usually."
good,A typical day for me at G.E. Oil And Gas was to come in and get my task done and go home. The people in management was very sneaky and not at all fair. Money is good but not worth it to be in an unhappy environment.
good,Gathered data from company data base for specific projects. Used previous projects as guide to maintain similarities. The document control team was made up of contract personnel and company inspectors.
good,I appreciate a lot  the balance  between the work and the personal  life. I'm impressed by the very professional behavior of all the employees  in a depressive oil  market  environment.
good,Typical day at work was being responsible to drive and rigging equipment to location. I learned to run equipment and safety procedures. Management was not handle well and hours were missing in pay checks. Learn to build friendships with co-workers and establish a good working environment Teamwork. The hardest part of the job is working long hours and staying alert at all times. The most enjoyable part of the job was vacation paid days off.
good,Good company to work for. I was laid off due to a reorganization and it was not a good experience for me at that time.  My co-workers were the best and everyone pitched in as a team.
good,"A great company and nice work place, "
good,"Great paying job that I would have made a career out of. Unfortunately, I was laid off. Had upper management been honest in the hiring of others, I would still be there."
good,"Chemical Services Innovation - provide cutting edge technology to the oil and gas industry. Team oriented and professional atmosphere. "
good,"treated as a number to fill a crew"
good,"In Ohio it was a disaster! We were expected to keep the process running even with and through breakdowns. It really took a catastrophic breakdown to shut us down. I learned that the further away from Houston Tx you get, the further the decline in the chain of command. again in Ohio management was not noticed however in Oklahoma they were great. I had the greatest co-workers ever. Keeping the system from breaking down. keeping the system from breaking down knowing I have done everything possible."
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company but it was very frustrating at times as well. The jobs we were assigned to do were not delegated to us correctly. More work loaded, less pay and no promotions. They over spent on needless things for the company then lay off to cover debt or loss of pressure pumping funds. They buy useless companies for employee to utilize but we never had time or the need to use them. No bonus' for the non-managers but bonuses for all upper management and directors. Things were flipped on us about every 3 months or less for a 'change' in the company. Many of the jobs would change right after we all just got adjusted to the present shift in the jobs. One thing Baker is consistent on is change."
good,"For my job the product I was building was very interesting.The  problem is Manager and Supervisor have no experience at all, they just care about  to make happy their friends and family members even though there is no help for the company and jobs getting done in fair amount of time or with quality, as long as they keep who they like. Horrible department to work for I wish Baker would look into that and change them managers those are no help and very unprofessional. They can do very unfair stuff over HR just to keep or promote the ones they want even if they do not have any skills or are good employees."
good,Management doesn't help you. They only take care of themselves. Not everyone has to come to shop. They try and use their power to belittle you.
good,Long hours (as is expected in oil field work). Difficult balance between work and family. Not for everyone.
good,a typical day in a warehouse. People are hard to work with. Hard to work with people who will not properly train you.
good,You work long hard hours as is typical in the oilfield. Management is often changing. You have to work twice as hard to earn the respect of your coworkers and crew as a woman in a man's field.
good,"I worked on Land Rigs as a Directional Driller. I had a really bad experience with management. They only believed in on the job training and they would only send a trusted few to the same rigs to run jobs. The biggest problem was the good old boy mentality in the oilfield and management’s lack of courage to go against the grain. Most of the MWDs and DDs complained about the work life balance because there is no rotation. If they like you, the will use you up but you will make good money as long as you can stand it."
good,"I read one of the reviews and it said ""It was so sad to see them let go of all the folks with longevity, knowledge and experience. People that were not at retirement age yet. Apparently this is something they've always done as an elderly gentleman told me they did the same thing in the 80's, then again in the 90's."""
good,I enjoyed the company as a whole but the division I worked for had a boss that ran it harassed everyone and micro managed something he had no clue what was going on and yet wanted things his way and not the company way.
good,Not efficient chain of command nobody can help you except your self. Hard to understand online training process. When we have problem there is no one to ask to solve the problem.
good,we had to go all over michigan and a little beyondto preferate and do logging the hole's od oil and natural gas well's.drive class b with air brake's oil field truck to well site's.rig up and blow the hole or log it too see where gas and oil pocket's were in the hole.we had to work with explosive's and radiacion.we had to work 24/7 and on call.
good,"Highly demanding workplace with enormous uncertainty.  GE Acquisition changed culture and direction significantly.  Senior roles require grit and endurance, with low expectation for recognition / rewards.  Tread carefully."
good,Management spouts their belief in ISO and updated processes but only makes changes which are forced upon them. Especially in the Cable Plant. Challenging the status quo will put you on a fast track to elimination.
good,"on and off never really knew what was going to happen next you were always kept in the dark like it was some big secret. weather was nasty either freezing cold pouring rain, or blazing heat. Work place culture was competitive and cut throat. No one was your friend."
good,"Not sure how Baker Huges is now that it’s owned by GE. But before that, the management/hr was bad. Tight crews and good  knowledge to be shared. The equipment was old and everything had to be ran  manually, which made great operators."
good,"nothing more to add, im not going to write a book about a company that cant  seem to function without selling out to what ever corporation has the deepest pockets"
good,Great place to start off in production with no experience and that is it. Spend the time looking for more competitive pay over the highly intensive labor and out of date equipment that some of the facilities have.
good,"Potential to be a great place to work, but lacks proper idea to retain good staff. Currently populated by many old timers who are pretty much sticking around as they are not motivated to look for a new job."
good,I worked for about 1 yr as cement Equip. Operator. worked alot of hours 12-15/day.  I then worked in the yard for 2 years loading cement bulk trucks w/ alot of hours. I was then laid-off at about 3 yrs.
good,When first started I was working for GE until GE bought Baker Hughes and it became Bake Hughes a GE company.  At which time they start to close down location.  My location was one that got closed
good,A great company to start with in the oil and gas industry. Good workplace culture. Very focused on customer satisfaction. The hardest part was work life balance. The most enjoyable part was the sense of community.
good,Esperienza lavorativa interessante in ambiente internazionale.
good,"In my position, the hours were conducive to a fair work family balance. Other positions worked lots of overtime. The biggest problems with BHGE are the following; too large and the red tape is miles thick. Instead of different groups working together, they all had their own goals, and these often conflicted. Management should truly make  customer satisfaction the overall goal and every group should somehow share it. I was not impressed with management overall and my group had 7 different managers during my tenure. Also, it's definitely a good old boys club atmosphere."
good,"In the early stages of developing a culture...blend of GE and Baker Hughes both cultures are very prevalent in certain areas.  Good idea of Fulstream, lets see how they pull it off successfully,"
good,"Baker is an excellent environment with the chance to grow and"
good,Management is similar to other big companies. Workplace culture is mixed - with people from different backgrounds. Hardest part of the job is figuring out the vision of the company/management. Easiest part of the job is to identify areas to contribute and execute with team members with similar mindset.
good,long work hours management sucked shift work wasnt fun no room for advancement maangment didnt care about employees and there was alot of favortisim..
good,"As always, there will be bad things that come with the good and this holds true to working for GE. The pay is not bad but the downside to being another little cog in such a large machine is that you're often seen as such. You are easily replaced and will be used until the breaking point is reached on a regular basis."
good,"So much has changed over the years, and when the oilfield tanked things got really ugly.  What I learned is to always have a backup plan because you never know when your number is up.  It is also prudent to have ample savings."
good,"12 hours was a typical day."
good,The company overall was a good company to work for. Although the immediate supervisors played too much favoritism towards family and friends within the company.
good,I wasn't there very long due to the lack of work and lack of commitment from the management to get me out training on job sites. I did my best with what I was l given
good,"Everyday began with a safety meeting. Safety was of the upmost importance, and I appreciate that in a company. "
good,"Lack of systematic process in place makes the supervisor, manager more stressful in every aspect of business. Company's mentality is highly focused in generating revenue (no problem with that for as long as it is supported) but lacks the resources (people, technology and process) to support that. Poor attention to quality, do not investigate failures of equipment so it can explain to the client what happen to tools and to the execution of the project, again boils down to not having systems/process in place."
good,I worked 160 to 180 hours every two weeks so if you're single then it will work out great but if you're married it's hard on the relationship. Good benefits and moved up fairly quickly in the company.
good,"Very bureaucratic, with a general lack of strong leadership and company direction. "
good,"I worked at 4 different companies within the Baker Hughes organization . I feel  that I was treated fairly and compensated in pay equal to or better than the industry average. Being that it has been 21 years since being in their employment, I do not feel that it is fair to make a current judgement on their operations."
good,"Some employees were great, others were not. Plant Management needs work. Left for  different opportunity but didnt work out. Will not go back to baker"
good,"Carreer progression if your face fits"
good,The down fall of working at this district before its closing was the lack of interaction between the regional and district management. The lack of this interaction leads to confusion and discontent among it's employees and direct management.
good,"typical day here involved standing around waiting for instructions, or room to participate in the work. We were divided into 15 man teams and the fracking equipment we worked on usually only required 3 to 7 people per current task. The hardest part of this job was the standing around and not actually doing diagnosis and repair work. here we were nothing more than equipment tear down specialists."
good,lufkin coca cola was a descent job. It would have been better if they had benifits . I enjoyed the relationships that I built with my customers. The best part of the job is the people that touched with my smile each day.
good,"It does not matter how much value you bring to your company, your customers, or to your work environment you are still susceptible to getting let go."
good,"Daily tasks included gauging tanks, delivering chemical and set up new chemical delivery systems for down hole injection systems."
good,"No consistency across operations, good work takes a back seat to friendships. Very unprofessional management structure"
good,"fast paced,"
good,"Graduate Intervention engineer working towards chartership on the MPDS programme. Working on abandonment and decommissioning projects, internal project initiatives and standardising documentation for the pressure testing council."
good,BHI has a highly competitive work environment in which success is modestly rewarded. The work life balance is definitely slanted toward work when you are in an outside sales position for an oilfield that is a 24/7 operation.
good,"A few friendly co-workers, management is usually easy to communicate with. Lot of work hours, but lack of job security."
good,Very busy Company to work for but rewarding.  There are  many challenges through out the day.  Never a dull moment.  The day just zooms past.
good,"When a corporation continues to introduce leading edge technology into an industry and still ranks 4th in ROI competitively, something is financially wrong from a management perspective."
good,"A very challenging work environment which is very satisfactory when you have completed a four week roster, I found all the people a pleasure to work with during my time at work, and enjoy the Oil field life a pleasure to be involved with."
good,"-Oilfield is so volatile no matter wherever you are you keep learning."
good,Great job loss of work there good co-workers. Oil and gas work is great when it is available. I would like go get more work in this field.
good,"A busy working environment currently experiencing challenging times."
good,"Some good co workers.  It does not matter to management how good you are at your job or whether you are an asset to the company.  They strictly reward ""friends and relatives"".  They do not care if you have given all your time to the company.  As soon as you ask for any benefits, promotion or time off you mark yourself as being ungrateful for them allowing you to work for them."
good,Need to be more focused on the culture of the Oil and Gas Industry and not GE. People become GE leaders not industry domain experts. This business is a just a stepping stone business for GE Energy.
good,"Burocrática demais, complicado desenvolver um trabalho simplificado."
good,"Empresa boa para se trabalhar, concorrência interna muito forte entre os companheiros."
good,"GE is fairly new to oil and gas.  Most of the experienced personnel left shortly after GE acquired pressure control.  They are trying to improve, but keep majoring in the minor areas."
good,"Plan job sites for Directional Drillers.  Very Busy.  My personal manager was great but the upper management was not pleasant.  Co-workers were ok, to busy to socialize. The drive was the hardest. Being as busy as I was.  Something new most days."
good,"Baker Hughes is a respectful company full of challenges and opportunities. Sometimes the bureaucracies of business can get in the way of accomplishing tasks and goals, though.This leads to a break down in quality of the work environment. For example, too many required safety card requirements. Incapable of keeping supplies on hand and other complications due to nature of massive size of the organization."
good,"Had worked for considerable time in BJ Services until bought by Baker. For me was a huge step backward. Company is not aggressive in smaller markets."
good,The work is challenging and will gain insightful knowledge of oil field services.  The co-workers are genuine people with everyday challenges similar to most companies.  The typical day is very active and fasted pasted.  Management has a hands off approach.  The hardest part of the job is the current market and the merger taking place.  The most enjoyable is the friends gained.
good,"Co-ordinate staging priority list and liaise with planning team to provide real time updates"
good,"Productive Schedule, Time Management for quality products, Fun and interesting employees, Keeping up with demand with available resources, Workforce retention"
good,"SAP Application and Security L2 Support for various Netweaver Applications. Troubleshoot application issues and provision customer based on required SAP access roles.  Utilized various security TCOD (Su01) to accomplish daily task include GRC.  Also, diagnose issues with inhouse billing SQL-Toad system to SAP Sales Orders and Material/Serial updates."
good,"It is (was) a good place to get a start in the oil and gas industry, but very slow to promote or cross train. HR runs everything whether you are qualified or not."
good,"I enjoyed the 8 months I worked there the money was great,the management worked with me and my situation as a recent widower raising two toddlers on my own."
good,"Busy, fast paced environment with personnel who will assist where possible."
good,"Training provided is decent, but there's little room for change or advancement in upstream chemicals.  Through the FE program, we were told that we could change product lines after finishing the program.  That didn't turn out to be true."
good,"Forward-thinking, long-term visioned Dept. and Team managers willing to take the chance of bringing the archaic 2D drawings dating back as far as 1833 into the realm of the 21st century, making models that today's fabricators can load up and crank out whenever the need arises."
good,"Baker Hughes used to be a really good place to work, but over the past 8 years the culture and work expectations have really changed.  Of all the freinds I worked with most recently none of them would say Baker Hughes is a great place to work.  Most were unhappy and stressed out."
good,"Typical oil field company all about who you know, most of the management is just there because of there tenure not there knowledge.  High hourly pay but no job bonuses, most frac hands for most companies average 100k a year, your lucky if you clear 80k due to lack of bonues.  Management does not take care of equipment and just runs it to the ground"
good,"work hours are long and hard, hardest part of the job is being away from your family.  If your planning to move up the ladder with hard work and dedication to the company alone..........look elsewhere."
good,"Very busy, always change, friendly employees, great experience, learned a lot, no job offer"
good,"I followed in my  duty instructions given by our management & management system, we learned many things related to operations & how to manage it."
good,"Ambiente calmo e agradável com horário flexivel."
good,In my opinion this is a good company to start into the oilfield with.  the have good training and benefits
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar, onde tem se flexibilidade, caso necessite de dia para trocar para poder ir a uma formatura ou outro necessidade"
good,nice cultural place different personalities but the management is unfair and doesn't care about your personal life and will fire you quick if they dont like you.
good,"the work,was very intersting. coworkers were very helpful and taught me alot. but i found out the work was for me. its not what i really want to do in life."
good,Baker Hughes is a good company. You will make a lot of money but for a price.
good,"Nice environment, hard working and loyal people, flexible schedule but poor upper management staff."
good,"First impression of company--hardworking employees and decent management.  Later experienced and witnessed incidences where managers did not support employees; Some managers lack training in federal law and people managing. Also, age discrimination is alive and well.  Hard work often executed on the backs of a dedicated few who get little recognition or merit. BH changed after GE entered the picture-morale suffered a lot and managers even more off-base.  May be good place for young person to get 3-5 years experience, and then sail on to expand your horizons."
good,Great while I work there. Things could be better when it comes to moving up in the company but like most jobs alot of promises that will never be filled.
good,Great place to work if you have a degree even if you aren't competent. Not great for skilled people or highly motivated people without degree. Benefits were better than most other local companies.
good,Fun working despite the less carer enhancement opportunity and lack of process flow. Will be good ground for fresh job seekers to develop skill in various area.
good,"Watch out, and be careful. Just like most other companies, when they get there teeth in you or you mess up your given the third degree. Certain people get away with bulling you and don’t get in trouble. And a lot of bearing false witness against other employee’s by other employee’s."
good,The company is not what it used to be. The supervisors have their favorites and do what they can to help them and will ignore everyone else. Management is to scared to step in and say something because they don’t want to start a conflict because that “person is friends with the supervisor”. If they get rid of certain supervisors and management it would be a great place to work again. The job security does fluctuate with the price of oil.
good,"Tienes capacitación por parte de la compañía, buenas prestaciones."
good,"I worked as a field engineer for 6 months. I learned a lot, but unfortunately I was laid off with a bunch of others due to the split between baker and ge."
good,"Very flexible place to work, the environment is friendly and easy to work, very inclusive culture, always  trying to make everyone feel comfortable to work here,"
good,"I loved the work and enjoyed the manager that hired me. Shortly after I  was hired another manager took over. The new manager that started was highly influenced by the person training me. For reasons unknown they started speaking ill about me. The new manager started being short and treated "
good,BHGE is a great place to work. You see professionals interacting without boundary. It is a place for fast pace leaders that are looking to make organisational impact. Training and development is a fundamental pillar and career development is self driving - no limitation. Compliance and QHSE are non negotiable.
good,The company has underwent a lot of turmoil the past three years with more on the horizon as GE plans to spin off BHGE. Many long time employees have opted to leave the company to look for more stable pastures
good,"Baker Hughes was a great company went i started there 6 years ago. HOWEVER, once the downturn happened things started changing for the worse. New management did not provide career growth opportunities, nor raises, and people who were willing to suck up received the growth opportunities. It is no longer the Baker Hughes that people used to know and love."
good,Competitive salary. Working day starts at 10.00. Long working hours. A lot of security limitations connected with the use of corporate computer. 30 day vacation.
good,"It depends on the product line or your department. My product line sucked. Worked many hours away from home. Basically had no life. The salary looks big but when you evaluate the time you put in, it shows one is only making $10/hr, not worth at the end of the day."
good,"Every company is different. Everyone has different opinion. It may be good for one person but bad for another person, vise versus. There are some things I like and some things  don't like."
good,A good company to work for. Significant funding provided for additional qualifications outwith the workplace such as degree. Enjoyable team to work with.
good,Job was ok. Not much advancement opportunities. Not enough time off. People were nice but very old fashioned. Most people were difficult to relate to for me.
good,Baker Hughes is a good company but too bureaucratic and made up of senior management that are not adept at moving business forward.  They management is overly concerned with politics and stock prices and not increasing market share.
good,Baker Hughes is very unstable since the acquisition by GE. There were a lot of layoffs and they are ongoing. The company is currently outsourcing North America Accounting to Kuala Lumpur.
good,"If you know someone that works there currently, they would have a better idea than me.  A lot of people worked there because they knew someone else that worked there."
good,"I have worked a majority of my career at Baker Hughes and I have learned a lot while there. Unfortunately, I have also wasted a lot of time there. The company does not promote personal growth and career advancement. It is more of who you know within the organization not what you have achieved."
good,"You can learn at Baker, but don't expect to be rewarded for all of your hard work. Their management picks and chooses who gets promoted, and many times, it makes no sense. You better know someone high up, plan on staying in the same role for a long time, or get in and get out."
good,It has a good work culture with team work and excellent technology. Provide opportunity to learn. Same work every day too much work load and stress on daily basis.
good,"Typical day was morning call in's to assess performance of projects and why if any delays."
good,"I worked in the middle east for BHGE. Overall it was a great experience.  However, my last manager was good at his job but a horrible leader.  He is the reason I left the company."
good,"Baker Hughes GE has the potential to be an incredible place to work, The main motivation has, unfortunately, been avoiding lay offs."
good,"Was a decent clean environment. "
good,"Create all outgoing BOLS, Close all BOLS from the day before, transact blends, receiving. Answer emails, Paybles"
good,"The last few years have been quite turbulent with failed attempts to sell the company, successful attempts to sell the company, and flip flopping plans of the acquiring company. I used to love the job, but now it has become so unclear where the company is going that what used to be a fun workplace has become a stressful job."
good,"working at this company in general is good, team work is encouraged  and safety is the first priority."
good,"With the recent splitting from GE & creating a new business, times have gotten worse for this business. Low salary increases, more work, less support from management for improving or changing business ideas."
good,This company has merged with General Electric and this should help improve the companies reputation as a leader in where it has been lacking.  Future should be better.
good,I enjoyed my time there and learned a lot.  Company offers a lot of training.  Typical Oil & Gas mentality & work culture; pretty much is working under what stereotypes you typically hear about working oil & gas industry.
good,"Started working within this big corporation with belief that vast opportunity for growth would be available, however it has comes to the attention of me and some of my peers that moving up in the company from the operations team appears to be less likely. I have learned alot about flows of pipelines and the purpose of my current position, while also improving communication, time management skilIs and computer skills, I feel I have experienced alot through the years, but feel that i have reached my highest pay and position within this company."
good,Long work hours good pay lots of heavy lifting and a fun group of guys to work with when you pull shift work am shift and pm shift good paying job when oilfield work is up an running
good,"I was a contract employee here. My manager wanted to hire me on full time, but his boss told him that she wouldn't hire me because I didn't smile enough. Never in my life had I missed out on a job opportunity because I didn't bust my butt on a daily basis, without smiling while doing it."
good,Os horário eram incompatíveis mais o ambiente de trabalho muito bom.
good,Pay is good but management is very stressful to deal with. THey are constantly changing crucial decisions while in the middle of a task and blaming the employees.
good,While working at bakerhughes I learned alot about downhole pumps. I enjoyed working there with my associates but management was for themselves and not for the workers..Hr dept. Did not help employees but leaned towards management
good,Zero work life balance. That phrase doesn't exist with this company. Management can tend to seem incompetent from time to time. But the pay is good. Or it was when I was there.
good,"Muito treinamento, e uma empresa que investe muito no empregado,"
good,"GE new to Oil & Gas industry had no service experience. Moved management  in that had no service experience. GE understands manufacturing, but did not do well in transition."
good,This is mainly a tool company. Top management does not support the division I was employed in. They have currently laid off most of the employees due to the recent downturn.
good,"Trabajo con mucho compromiso hacia al cliente, gran cantidad de conocimientos adquiridos"
good,When i first got th job.was told itll be a 10 month work assignment. With the possibility of going permanent. After only a few days in.learned that itll be at least a year before they will consider giving a stable position. One guy went 2yrs. This is a job for a young person who looking to make quick money for a short period of time.
good,"I learned alot at Baker Hughes. I liked being hands on with the tools. I got moved around alot so I got to see how other departments worked,"
good,"I was an intern here for a summer. In the interviews they ask you all about what you're interested in, but unfortunately for me they didn't actually seem to care at all what I was interested in."
good,"Competitive benefits and compensation for work done. Choose not to comment any further."
good,"1. Typical work day morning meetings, safety concerns, work flow,and shift turn over."
good,Baker Hughes una multinacional con una cultura organizacional establecida con personas comprometidas.
good,"Você tem de ser pontual e corresponder a todos que apostarem em você no caso a empresa ser profissional, uma experiência muito boa a cada dia aprendemos cada vez, mais a humildade e essencial, sempre saber lidar bem com seus líderes o objetivo será bom para todos, nunca me envolvi em fofocas e sempre procurar ajudar seu crescimento pode ser o meu, não existe parte ruim em trabalhar, conviver com pessoas que talvez nunca se encontraram e formar no trabalho uma nova família para que a empresa seja um ambiente bom de se trabalhar e alcançar o sucesso esperado."
good,Started out great but took a cut in pay and hours after being promised a promotion and a raise. Management was good. Long hours not many days off. Away from home alot.
good,Best outfit to work for to ensure you stay busy.  Compensation is not in line with smaller companies. Management is completely off hands.  Very little support unless the job is in jeopardy.
good,"My time with the company was always busy. A typical work day consisted of meetings, correspondence with various departments and clients. In my time there, I was able to learn many new tools to use to streamline the processes in place to make it a more productive procedure. My direct managers were great, they cared about their employees and would find the best way to utilize your skills and strongly encouraged you to enhance your skills and learn new skills to help you advance. The upper management was not so encouraging. The hardest part of the job was proving to the upper management that some change was good to make it easier to streamline a process."
good,"We would take 10 hours off from when we clocked out and would then get back into the job.  Often times we would go to work at 1 or 2 in the morning and not get back to 7 or 8 at night.  When things went well it was a rewarding job knowing that we were providing a vital service for the economy of our country.  I was a supervisor so I was required to look after the safety of my crew and all those on location while we were working.  It was my job to identify the hazards for the crew, write them down, document that the crew heard and read about the hazards, and get feed back to discover hazards that the crew found that I missed.  I learned to delegate because a frac crew was a large crew with many moving parts and I was dependent on my crew performing well if I was going to do a good job.  The hardest part was the 5% of a crew that did not follow directions and was a hindrance to the success of all.  When we had a challenging situation and the crew performed better than expected it felt good to go home knowing we had earned our pay that day."
good,Was a decent place to work until the lay offs began. Management was very hands off and not very good with communicating expectations.
good,"My day at work was to get ready for the next job and have your equipment ready.I have learned to work as a team here at Baker hughes and B.J.My co workers were very helpful; we all worked as a team. the hardest part of the job was waking up early in the morning and weather usually took control sometimes.The most enjoable was the operation of the job and the co-workers we were a family, at work."
good,"Job security always low, Pay is high with bonuses but may not be better than operator company. Field work 15 days on 6 off this varies by product line. 12 hour days on leases plus commute to and from hotel so expect a 14-16 hour day."
good,"This is a large corporation that treats you like a number. Expendable. When the market is high they value their employees, as soon as it turns, everyone is a number, salaries and benefits can be cut. Income is not safe, even in writing. Reductions and Deductions.The smaller satellite offices value their employees and work as a team. Excellent relationships can be built here that will last a lifetime. You all go through it together."
good,"My review does not reflect Baker Hughes as a company in total...yet it only reflects the location I worked.  At the Oil Tools (downhole tools) location on Emmott Rd, the management really had their minds closed to any and every outside idea that came in the door.  My background for 15 years prior was not in oil tools, but in a different career altogether.  When I had ideas, I was always reminded how this was the oil field.  Basically saying my experience was null and void.  Quality is quality and any experience there-in would be beneficial, at least that is what I have learned over the years.  The floor management was very closed minded to any ""outsider"" that had not been there with them over the years or knew their families for years.  I had never felt more like an outsider in any other job I have had in my 30 years of working.  Upper management was hard, if not impossible, to get to talk to.  They were invisible unless there was an event they had to show their faces at."
good,The Odessa branch of Baker Hughes suffers from a severe lack of communication that starts from the top. Expectations are not clearly presented and the company is very reactive instead of proactive which creates a great deal of stress on employees.
good,I worked at baker over 7yr I was good at what I did but when oil field slowed I was 1st round lay off. The only sense I could make was being high hrly paid. But then after talking to friends. It is my understanding that the dist. Mngr didn't like me because I didn't talk to him very much. Then 6mo after they started rehire and I applied so I told one of the op supervises I applied and he said ok I will find ur app so we can get you back in. Then I talked to another friend there who over heard the same dist. Manager say he'll no we won't hire him. When he was told I applied back.
good,Very demanding position. Ton of paperwork. Hardest part of the job was to figure out the constantly changing politics and positioning.
good,Oversee drilling operations at well site.  Make on the go decisions that can make or break drilling operations.  Work project from start to finish when drilling tools are in hole or being prepped.
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job was lunchtime, big lunchroom and a cafeteria to where all co-workers can interact. Always new tasks and jobs, always interested in what was new to come."
good,"This was my first career opportunity in the energy sector.  Nature of the job led to long periods of time on the road and an unpredictable schedule.  This sacrifice was balanced with a high level of pay."
good,"There is no doubt why this company was bought out by Halliburton.  Equipment run into the ground, management out for themselves, employees making things happen on the ground paid well but under appreciated."
good,"Not much life/work balance.  Good compensation.  Was better before the impending Halliburton merger, loss all identity as a company and has folded under the pressure of market conditions. Co-workers are very knowledgeable and a pleasure to work with. Good place to start in the oilfield."
good,"Baker Hughes pays well. However, they do not have a good personnel strategy to keep personnel trained. It is a crisis management organization."
good,"7 & 7 Hitch"
good,Interesting place to work with new technology in the oil field industry. Good people to work with but the they were going to an open seating environment with no privacy and very noisy.
good,good pay great benefits but lots of you giving them your life and not getting much in return really other than a good pay check and benefits. The job is a sacrifice for your family financial well being and not you really being there.
good,Company still not willing to change.  Success from past in Oil & Gas keeping management from focusing on the future.  Personnel management based on quarterly reports leaves company vulnerable when market returns.  Employees seen as replaceable.
good,i wouldn't work for this company again. it was Ghetto yet management was super unprofessional. it was like you are in high school all over again. i wouldn't suggest anyone to work there
good,"Being the first point of contact for the company can be a very busy job, I like a challenge and this job worked out very well for me. I like meeting new people and communicated very well with co-workers"
good,"Working with the mentally challenged can be rewarding, but at the same time very stressful due to the low pay and long hours"
good,Professional environment and Multi business scope wordwide.
good,"Although Baker desired to gain a portion of the Pipe Recovery market in Williston, ND.,it never worked out for them. Local management failed to see the importance of fully relying on the pipe recovery experts knowledge of how to grow the business."
good,"Work life balance can be better. Also, minimal guidance is given to someone coming from outside GE."
good,"Well organised & able to prioritise time and workloads in a high activity environment."
good,"Housing, transportation and food allowance is separate pay from basic wage. Thirty days vacation with pay plus round trip plane fare to and from the Philippines paid by the company."
good,"As DD a work day may start any time, you are on call; it is good and sad news in the same time. Good because you get paid on each day you spend on the rig site. Sad because you have to leave what you were doing."
good,"In this industry, you can expect there to be a lot of competition. Many companies have come and gone with the Marcellus shale. This company has been around long before this shale was discovered. It will probably remain long after its completion. However, my experience with the people who comprise this companies backbone has been less then pleasant. It was bad enough that particular divisions were comprised mostly of relatives of the boss. However, the most ridiculous aspect of this company is their hypocritical ""Pillars of Business"". How a company can regularly harass and belittle its employees for actions carried out on a daily basis by the management is beyond my comprehension. Then there is the pure lack of professionalism from the staff. Missed commissions, unpaid hours, and the manipulation of payroll reports. There are a lot of more qualified companies out there to work for. It is only one mans experience but I can say I am not the only person who feels this way."
good,"the benefits and pay are good, but career advancement is based on who you know, not skills."
good,"Preparing quotation forms for spare parts for choke valves."
good,"will discuss once you contact me.for now just sending you my responsibilities within baker hughes:•	Run in hole completion equipments including Liner Hangers "
good,"Left alone, but not much support. They do not hire contractors."
good,"worked with oil field crews, took calls, made copies, put together paper work for jobs and put information in computer for jobs.."
good,24/7  on call not a lot of time for the home gone out of town a lot and working your butt off for almost next to nothing.
good,"The typical day is pretty long sending emails taking phone calls calming people down with limited information. I learned a ton about dealing with other companies, third party contractors, and delegating duties. Management really didn't want to hear from you until things go bad. But I do enjoy the limited supervision."
good,"Great products."
good,"Baker Hughes is one of the world's largest oilfield services companies. With over 60 K employees globally and Operating revenue of 20 B USD, Baker Hughes operates in over 90 countries, providing the global oil and gas industry with products and services for drilling, formation evaluation, completion, production and reservoir consulting."
good,"Acceptable workplace, basic operations and average morale."
good,"Aprendi muito nela, muito aprendizado, área de completação muito ampla"
good,"This position require a lot of interaction with people around the globe, different cultures, understand their requests and pressures, clear up communication lines, planning and define action points as also a follow up on each issue."
good,"No comment. Appreciate the time I worked for the company.  Had good benefits and flexibility which allowed Work and family life balance."
good,"Job security is not there but it is expected to be like that in the oil and gas industry. Other than that, Baker Hughes a pretty decent place to work."
good,"Good people, good management culture, safety, benefits, hours wish there was a branch in New Braunfels or San Antonio but overall all great company to work for!"
good,"Big company, but poor management, not keyed in with what's happening around them, many of the Manager's are old school, not been trained, very poor on employee engagement and not interested in any career development. Salaries stagnant..."
good,OK pay and benefit; but very cyclic nature of business; uncertainty tends to be normal condition in most sections of this business. market and management change leads to performance issues.
good,"They don't practice what they preach when it comes to safety. They expect you to drive for 3 hours hauling hazardous materials, ie radiation and explosives, on little to no sleep. Then they sit you in a safety meeting and tell you never to do that, but when a customer calls you go regardless-- no back up plans. If you didn't sleep you're still expected to go. Dangerous environment and low paying, especially for the amount of things you need to know and the certifications you must have,  not to mention a clean record and a clean hair test that can go back 7 years."
good,There were great people there. Some were extremely knowledgeable and some were not. The vision wasn't being carried our because it wasn't being communicated early and often.
good,"It's  fast paced,  rotating  shift,  a lot of  overtime, a person can  make  a significant amount of money  if they are  willing to work  hard,  it's a  union shop"
good,"Working for BHGE gave me a platform to gain knowledge of the oil field. However, in my later years with the company the mission was not straight forward or changed with the wind. Overall, BHGE is a good place to work."
good,"on tour 12.5 - 13 hrs everyday."
good,"Well....over the 10 years I worked at Baker I was able to make some great fiends and wonderful relationships with some of the best people I know. However that being said,a big company as Baker Is they always seem to find a way to mess with success."
good,Baker Hughes provides a safe and challenging environment to work and develop your skills.  Compensation is below average but the people you get to work with are great!
good,"went from getting a promotion,  to getting laid off"
good,All levels of the corporation are lacking direction after the takeover by General Electric. This has led to a drop in motivation of employees and a high turnover of people.
good,Situación de General Electric ha generado incertidumbre sobre el futuro de la empresa.
good,"Upper management has little value for your opinion, and that shows when the budget tightens up. I had one really terrible manager, an okay manager, and for a long duration, an outstanding manager. That manager's ability to manage was the main reason for me not to leave sooner, as the attitude and safety culture of the employees was horrendous and went undisciplined."
good,Ashame a company at one toime that was terrific to work for has dropped so low in taking care of its workers. If you do not KA you do not stand a chance. They will hang you out to dry . They do not back their employees for anything.
good,GE has this internship program where they put these really green kids fresh out of college in charge of departments. They have no knowledge of the processes we use and no experience in running a department. A lot of them are trying to make a name for themselves in the company and try to shortcut processes which you just can't do within the culture there.
good,With the oil industry it is up and down and some jobs are not as secure.  Good place to work unless the market takes a turn.  The pay could be more competitive as we live in an area with a high living cost.
good,"working days were not bad , friendly environment "
good,"It's a good place to work"
good,Work hours are flexible as long as supervisor approve. Plenty of overtime available. Pay and raise can be improve. Work environment is better than average.
good,Top heavy organization that continually refocused and changed management with different agendas.  Great potential for improvement if vision was stable and managed from within instead of from a higher corporate level.
good,"The job was good, but the management worked using the good ole boy system.  If you were one of them you moved up.  If you weren't you didn't.  they did treat the employees well tho."
good,A empresa possui tecnologia otimos profissionais porem não consegue por em prática todo a estrategia desenvolvida. Possui um setor comercial com pouca efetividade devido ao baixo desempenho nos prazos de entrega.
good,"Baker Hughes and GE Oil & Gas both bring a great deal to the post merger company, and the Full Stream strategy is a good one. Merging the GE and Baker cultures and setting R&D, product and commercial priorities and execution are still underperforming."
good,Had a lot of fun traveling to other states all over the USA to perform jobs. There was a lot of things to learn in this field. I would do it again if given a chance later in life.
good,"Its easy to learn new things with Baker Hughes, they provide the tools, equipment and on the job trainings as well, as long as you want to learn there is no limit for you to learn new things"
good,"baker was good until the halliburton merger happened. once the attempted halliburton merger occured, things changed for the worse. they became very hard to work for."
good,Carry out analysis of samples and formulate report thereafter. Although this job requires shift work away from home it affords me plenty time off to enjoy my hobbies
good,"They are a good place to work, with great benefits and pay. The major downside is they are dependent on the oil market. If the market is up the job is great. When the market goes down they are quick to lay off employees."
good,"lots of manual labor that should of been automated for safety aspects job tasks;"
good,"Productive, fun, Friendly colleagues, helpful, challenging, learnt new things, gathered new and more information, workplace culture is good, hardest part of the job is time constaints"
good,Id like to see the salaries and benefits improved to be more competitive with the competition. Depending on what schedule you like this is a rotating shift that may or may not work for you.
good,Good company to work but don't come sick because the bosses don't like.
good,"too many non workers  that were non productive.  did not get work . let accountants run oilfield end of work till we didnt have any work."
good,Constantly under extreme pressure. But you get to be involved a lot and quality experience to your port folio. You get to meet a lot of people from diverse cultures.
good,"Good place to foster relationships, especially for the time allowed to be a part of such a strong team. I really enjoyed the opportunity work with great people. The hardest part was the continued layoffs and cutbacks which seemed to be ongoing."
good,This was a temp position but it was a very straight forward environment. Organization needed a great deal of administrative support and organization of facilities. Overall pleasant working environment.
good,GE has many diverse businesses.  The typical day varys depending on your job and global commitment.  The most difficult aspect of GE is the lack of movement on decisions and projects.  Depending on the manager your hours and life balance are accomdating.
good,"Pay is reasonable.  Management was poor at managing people.  Benefits are competitive.  "
good,"There is a totally new set of management people in place now.  My experience has nothing to do with the current staff."
good,"Learned many things in this company, how certain procedures work, safety is a huge thing which is wonderful. They want you to go home the same way you went to work, in one piece. The hardest part of the job would be the times that there are lulls, and you have to force yourself to be busy, because not only are you finished with your work, everyone else is finished with theirs. If you work in the front office, you can't go in the back and help because you are not certified to go back and do the kind of things that those people do. The most enjoyable is definitely the people to build good work relationships with. They are the ones who give you the best knowledge of how to maintain the right balance, or work life and personal life. They don't let you become a robot."
good,For the most part i enjoyed my time at Baker Hughes. I was entrusted to work on my own initiative usually in some very remote locations with little or no access to technical back-up.
good,"long hours and a very hard job,not knowing where you are from week to week. the best part about the job was the people and learning from them. the one thing i learned was to keep pushing it will come."
good,"Baker Hughes, good company to work for, except for some of the legacy BJ divisions who seemed to be stuck in the past with an arrogant oppressive attitude towards employees and weak management. Baker have managed to bring most of these divisions into line. Good company, looks after its employees, excellent benefits."
good,"Great team to work with, but there appear to be several people in the wrong positions. The Company has room to improve on its Project Controls as it does not take Project Controls seriously and have no Processes in place to improve."
good,"Found the company to have great benefits for medical ect. Vacation on par with provincial labour standards but working enviroment within this division company was extremey stressful and operations manager was not clear on job expectaions during the hiring process. Upon starting the position I quickly found the description i was given not at all accurate to what I was actually doing on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. I was not given any training other than a book with some basic procedures."
good,"When you work here, English play an importance role as your presentation skill. You can learn very high standard HSE with good trainer. Technical not require too much"
good,"Formação de equipe com pouco objetivo globalizado, muitas tarefas acumuladas e profissional fora de função ou com pouca qualificação para o setor, gerando insegurança e atrasos em tarefas dependentes deste. Falta de incentivo e exclusão são pertinentes em alguns setores impedindo desenvoltura à exposição de ideias para soluções . Ótima estrutura, recursos de consultas acadêmicas, apoia qualidade de saúde e vida, do bem estar social do funcionário, da família e do meio ambiente. Apoia estudos e serviços sociais."
good,This company has poor management skills. they play favoritism to certain employees. This is a company you can not grow with in. Pay doesn't match the work.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Baker Hughes, but was promised advancement and opportunity.  Due to the downturn in the oil business, these opportunities were not available."
good,"Venders provide free food"
good,"I checked e-mail to see what inventory was needed at other branches.  I then determined if we could spare it to them.  If so, arranged to have it shipped.  I checked reports to see what inventory we would need and ordered it or asked our other branched for it if economical.  I ran monthly cycle counts."
good,"During daily activities, I would find and source opportunities for field service engineers by liaising with a variety of individuals within different global location.  Sourcing opportunities for employees ensure that the monthly and yearly personnel utilisation targets of 95% are met.  In order to source the appropriate personnel, I have to ensure that all employees are fully competent and compliant.  Furthermore, personnel are required to work within various locations, therefore the appropriate wok permits and visas are also obtained to comply with different legal requirements.  This is a fast faced, hands on role which requires excellent communication and planning abilities.  It also involves working closely with the rotator pool Operations Manger which is the most enjoyable part of this position.  During my time in this position, I have also participated within a ""Team Leader Programme"" and over time have developed this team leading skills though daily coordination of the personnel.  The most challenging part of this job occurs when there are legal restictions in place which make its very difficult to place individuals within jobs.  For example, obtaining work permits can be reliant upon politics within certain locations.  Most of the work is completed where I am located within the Aberdeen Office, with field personnel based globally, a work colleague based in Germany and my manager based in South Africa."
good,"Based on the experience that Contract Engineers can provide, I was treated as if I was just a position that needed to be filled."
good,"great co-workers; good training; positive work atmosphere"
good,"If you are willing to work long hours in adverse conditions, then this is a great job (fracking.) In my department I had a great deal of autonomy. I learned a lot about the oil & gas industry while employed with Baker. All immediate managers and supervisors were great and knowledgeable. The issues begin much hire up the corporate ladder and are made worse by the looming Halliburton buy-out. Many policies that dictate day-to-day business are handed down from people who have never worked in the field. If you want clarification on any issues good luck with the website (which you will most likely be referred to.) The company is too big for it's own good and the website is a confusing mess because of that. Trying to figure out who to call for specific issues is just as big of a problem. With a buy-out taking place many employees and their positions are being eliminated with no clear way of replacing  their function. This makes getting answers about everything from insurance to HR needs a disaster. None of this really matters though since most likely there will be no Baker Hughes once Halliburton is finished with them. That fact drives morale down to nothing and puts everybody on edge. It really did start out as a great job, but by the end it was nerve wracking."
good,"Too many people in management. Horrible communication. Constantly told ""You don't think, You just work"" when trying to bring up ideas."
good,"Buon luogo di lavoro , possibilità del telelavoro e del remote working in casi di urgenza"
good,"Its hard to criticize  Baker Hughes, unfortunately they are in the oil field industry. As being in the oil field industry, you cannot control or stabilize the field. Oil is a global product, what happens in Saudi Arabia matters in Louisiana. With that said, Saudi Arabia sends their people to US universities and then companies like Baker Hughes, Halliburton, chevron ect... hire them, train them, and they then go back to their country with the skills we gave them and run the US oilfield into the ground. Its insanity. When the layoffs come, the first ones to go are the trouble makers. The second ones to go are the people who worked their way up into engineer positions with no college education. That's where my beef lies. They will layoff people some of which are better skilled and more experienced, just because they don't have a degree in French literature from Plymouth rock community college. Its a vicious cycle. The American economy today seems to think you cannot tie your shoe without masters degree, and what's sad is for the most part the people who have the advanced degrees are the ones who needed advanced degrees to know how to tie their shoes."
good,Baker Hughes is a great company and offers great opportunities to their employees.  Baker is fast paced and technically engaging.
good,have worked for baker hughes two different occasions and laid off both times. not to stable for the family at home. Management at the Odessa yard I worked at was not understanding at all or willing to work with you. Upper management just took care of themselves and not the employees actually out in the field working.
good,Experience of being Assistant and Admin related  jobs. Learned Multiple tasking and got experience in the legalities of visa process as well as arranging high level meetings for the enior management
good,"Very little organization.  New Processes implemented due to someone creating it just for job security.  Politics are heavy in the workplace, and is run like a small town.  If your not a neighbor or friend of someone in charge, you won't move up, are be taken seriously."
good,"Supervisão da montagem e descida de tubulares off-Shore e on-Shore."
good,"Our co-workers make the day enjoyable. If it wasn't for them our job would not be tolerable. Baker is not what it use to be. Healthcare coverage dropped over the last few years. There is no advancement opportunities. Management is okay as long as you're in good with the managers then the advancement opportunities come along. But the good thing about this company are some of the benefits. For example they match your 401k, they offer stocks to the employees they offer quite a few discounts for us as well. Such as car buying and hotels when traveling. Overall baker as a whole is not the same anymore, morale has dropped over the past two years or so."
good,Always on the move on the assembly line making sure everything goes out as planned. Employees are helpful when you fall behind.
good,Good place to work for but hard times with the oil prices going bust. So lay offs are happening. Company did their best as keeping as many floor employees first over management.
good,Need to balance work and life better. They pay well but very long hour. 60 Plus hours a week. Industry leaders but have little loyalty to personnel.
good,Many great memories whilst employed with this company. Good cultural experience and a leader in their area of expertise. Time well spent!
good,"Review is same as former."
good,"Great place to work the first 2 years and then the oil and gas industry began to change in our area and instead of getting overtime I was forced to work a straight 40 hour week. This cut my take home pay by more than half and that makes a big difference when supporting a family. The work environment was at one time a great place, but as many got let go and hours were cut, tensions became high. I am looking for a career that will sustain me through retirement."
good,Not properly structured at the corporate level in the division Im familiar with.If the would elect to make changes in Houston besides on the branch level i think they would be much more profitable.
good,"In the last 3 years working for Baker Hughes, I have gained a vast amount of knowledge and skills."
good,Pay was ok but the job has no benefits and they can let you out at the drop of a dime work was fairly easy jjhgvghfdxxxc vcfrxdxze bxedx
good,"BHI has an overall good working atmosphere."
good,"I enjoyed baker when I first started of course I didn't know any better but now I do, its all about who you know and not about what you know."
good,Overall a decent company to work for.  Day to day was pretty predictable even though the work location changed daily due to the nature of the business.
good,Great place to work. management in the office are great people. The employees are good to work with. you work with a lot of diff. people
good,"Working as a field engineer operaing LWD; or logging wile drilling, tools is not that difficult of a job in itself, but the uncertainty of when you will be working and the current uncertainty of the oilfield makes it more difficult. Going offshore without a real schedule is a challenge in itself. Going offshore from anywhere from 2 days to 5 and a half weeks at a time, with a average of between 2 to three weeks. This was actually the hardest part of the job. Once on location the cabin/office needs to be set up, all the sensors must be installed on the rig, and then the cables must be ran to the sensors. Running the cables can be quite a task depending on the site. Once up and running tools are tested and programmed. After the tools are sent down the hole the job is more laid back as long as there are no tool problems. While drilling the well, the data is recorded by the computers and logs are generated daily. Headers are updated and daily paperwork is maintained. Upon the completion of the job everything is rigged down and sent back. Logs are finalized in the office and wait for the next call to go back out."
good,"As a contractor, job security was iffy. Management was lacking. Many people complained about their jobs and their manager(s)."
good,"Go to shop pick up billing for customers if we had any, head to the field call on rigs at well sites or stay in town calling on customers in the offices. Management was great until upper management changed. coworkers were great bunch of guys I try and get along with every 1. Hardest part of job was 24hr call the late night calls and early morning stuff when you have to go get tools for customers that late. Abel to work independently meeting new people some social events."
good,"As an employee in the oil and gas field my tasks include pressure testing pipelines, cementing wells, I have my CDL license so I drive trucks, I do mechanical work on vehicles and wells along with many other tasks. I enjoy outdoor work and find the oil and gas well jobs to be both fascinating enjoyable however, the hardest part of the job is the hours, 14 to 16 hours a day."
good,Overlifting and the use of a 20' snipe was a daily activity for work in the open hole end of the shop. Shoulders and back eventually gave out and had to quit.
good,I worked on the field and felt that office people are very much disconnected from us. There are many inefficient practices and management doesn't listen to the suggestions of field employees; instead they are focusing on quantity of orders rather than quality of fulfilling them. Balance between work and life is terrible and very little regard is given to employees well being.
good,"inspection"
good,Daily responsibilities included meeting with team leader to layout priorities for team members. Utilized engineering skillset to troubleshoot and develop process improvement ideas as well as worked with product engineering on new product introduction. Engaged daily with supply chain and sourcing team to prioritize past due items and expedite short cycled orders. Organized and schedule customer witness tests with project manager and engineers to ensure full support and resource allocation was available.
good,good place to work i really injoyed it worked hard and long hours
good,"in broken arrow, ok. few reviews were listed. overall, the work environment was good, pay very good, pressure high but tolerable. Low-end management was unprofessional and uneducated, seem to have a good ole boy policy for advancement. I was a lead person 8 of my 10 years with baker. I watched too many good employees let go including myself for no other reason than the shop supervisors did not like you or you made them look bad to their superiors. this company seems to be rewarding to mostly office workers and not so much plant workers. Sadly, it could be very rewarding for everyone, but isn't."
good,"very repetative, not a lot of good communication skills for the motor shop division"
good,"Loved to  work here, Good people ancd managment. Some hard days but you get those sometimes."
good,"Enjoy working as a team, poor management, the hardest part of the job when you away from home, got used to work in the extremely cold weather of north Dakota."
good,"Saftey meeting in the morning before work, lead mechanic asignes work to all mechanics, field personel prepare work trucks with parts, oil, coolant,etc......  20min breaks at 9am and another at 3pm. lunch are from 11:30-12:30. Stop work and clean shop at 5:30pm."
good,to get the job done safety first.get along with co-workers.
good,"On a typical day would include receiving order lists from sales engineers, to organise the tools needed to go offshore, load cargo baskets with the tools that are getting shipped, service the tools by striping, cleaning, getting the individual parts inspected, and then re build the tool using service units and drawings, updating tool history and stock using computed program SAP."
good,"-Muy ameno"
good,"It's a lot of different things. "
good,Got to work early everyday. Work 99% of every weekend for 15 years. And gave it my all. Had to deal with hazardous chemicals everyday with a chance of myself or someone getting hurt or killed. I did this 100% safe the whole time I worked there.
good,work days were the same once you learned one job you were there until you retired. There was nothing challenging about the job I would say the best part of the job was your co workers they were like an extended family. Sense overtime happend on a whim you spent alot of time with co workers and alot of friendships were devolped over time.
good,"overall a decent job to have. Plenty of security, decent compensation, work truck that was used as personal as well. Very long hours, rotated between days and nights made it very difficult to plan anything outside of work. Sent to other districts with little to no warning for weeks at a time. Job overall was easy and there is always something to learn"
good,Greet coworkers. Check emails. Arrange the work load schedule for the day and start taking care of business. Most co-workers are very pleasant and helpful. Most people are very new to the company. It is difficult to find the right person to answer questions when you need help.
good,"It is a fun and productive workplace, it's just the management are unfair to certain employee's does play the favorite game with employee's."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was working on site. Worst part of job was the manangement of operations as the company overhired for the norteast district so there was alot of down time.
good,An enjoyable place to work. Co-workers were supportive and friendly.
good,"The work schedule is 8 on 2 off/ 8 on 3 off, which is a little rough when you are away from home. I have learned how to manage this busy work schedule, ands also have retained knowledg of running equipment, managing co-workers and aspects of paperwork."
good,"nothing to say really, other than the management is to prideful of themselves some that are in a high postion of responsibility show themselves to be too overbearing"
good,Good place to work. No clear path for career advanced. People were worried more about hierachy of GE and it felt too big as a company. Good co workers but no proper training. I felt like a needle in a haystack at times.
good,"It is a multi national company, therefore expect an overall diverse working environment. There are several opportunities to work oversees in other global regions if you choose to pursue."
good,"Open hole wireline. Drilling rigs, heavy tools, danger in every step. Radiation. Explosives. On call whenever not on days off. Much time from home... not for me, thank you."
good,The work culture here was nice. I enjoyed that they made everyone feel welcomed even though everyone had different skills everyone worked as a team here.
good,"Superintendent was a real stuck on himself kind of guy. No one was good enough. The employees worked good together, benefits were decent, pay was underwhelming."
good,Great technology solutions but need help to get these to solutions to their customers as they have limited sales and business acumen in the division I worked for.
good,Great technology and challenges.  Very caustic environment.  Back stabbing peers.  A company with a tremendous customer base with technology challenges.
good,"Great technology and portfolio potential, and fair pay and benefits. However, BHGE needs to have more solid, stable leadership who stick to business strategy and drive clear improvement each quarter in reality to market changes. BHGE's legacy as a GE business has caused too many processes and systems to be ""carried over"" into operations and no longer work properly to have the company move quickly."
good,"Average management."
good,"Nice place to work"
good,"Need new management and they got all new management after I got laid off and I heard things were much better now!"
good,Working at baker Hughes it was a very non-stressful job it was not hard just time consuming. It kind of got hot but there was an office that we could go in if time slowed down while we were at work.
good,"Good company to work for because its a large company with great benefits. Recently bought by GE and fellout of a purchase recently be Halliburton. "
good,The company has a resourceful and very knowledgeable staff at this location. The work environment is positive throughout the day along with a very good team setting.
good,"An international industrial service company and one of the world’s largest oil field service companies, providing services for oil drilling, formation evaluation, completion, production and reservoir consulting."
good,"Massive corporation. Found it extremely difficult to navigate any process or procedure. New experience for me and I didn't feel as though any amount of effort, or lack thereof, on my part would ever make any contribution to the company."
good,They had a really good schedule it was a fun place to work the benefits were amazing I was always home with my family paid vacation was really good great atmosphere to work in
good,"This is a typical day. Distributed mail to appropriate recipient addresses and departments"
good,I spent 20 years of my professional life here.  I learned a lot about corporate life and it gave me a foundation for future jobs i have had. I loved my job and the people I worked with.
good,leadership changed from day to day. there for polices and procedures didn't always correspond with work instruction. Some people in leadership positions should not have been in such position.
good,na - oilfield company so everyone should know the work has an up/down cycle. Tools were decent and stable to work with. Not many failures associated with jobs.
good,"Working in chemicals product line. Some nice benefits like a work truck (comes with big brother, but whatever), flexible work hours, and supposedly a new permissive leave policy in 2019. We will see. Also a new yearly bonus structure to pay in 2019. Again, we will see. Bonuses are never a guarantee. "
good,"They never seemed to focus on getting work done. Just a lot of talking about working, but no one actually doing any work. "
good,I am unable to respond to this question due to non-disclosure agreements.  This is an inappropriate question required field.  I shouldn't be required to fill this out.
good,"Bom lugar para se trabalhar, tive toda minha experiencia e conhecimento na Baker onde trabalhei por oito anos no meu primeiro emprego. O ambiente de trabalho é bom, plano de carreira só para engenheiro ou cargo superior."
good,Before I left Baker Hughes it was going through a merger requisition. Moral decreased and certain decisions were made by management that did not make since. The customers suffered for these changes.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the constant projects that are worked on, the learning curb allows for a challenging environment and continuous growth."
good,Empresa com bons benefícios porém com baixos salários e forma de avaliação baseada no relacionamento pessoal e nem tanto no desempenho profissional de cada um.
good,I had 12 hour shifts. Worked nights with lead man that didn't stay at his work place. Did a lot of talking while other workers did their work. Hardest part of job was the staying up 12 hours a night. The most enjoyable part was that we had comfortable working conditions inside wasn't burning up or freezing to death
good,"I did coiled tubing, which closed down in that area after I left.  Baker does not pay as much as smaller companies, but there is more room for advancement.  You a just a number though, and they will get rid of you in a heartbeat if it suites them.  Any oilfield work is unstable."
good,"If in the field had to work for 12 hours in either day or night shift. Sometimes, remote areas with no communication. Sometimes pushy coordinators."
good,GE is good for anyone who like to work as part of a big corporation. It will make you a better person who can work as part of a bigger team. I had a supporting group of people on my team.
good,Overall good company to work for but some changes need to be made in management and wages need to be alot better. The reason for me to leave if I choose to is to learn other aspects of the oilfield
good,Baker was bought twice in 2 years; each one had some turmoil; right now it's a part of General Electric. Things should get better as the GE side brings some focus to Baker.
good,"Unfortunately, when the fluctuating price of condensate and natural gas was down, the Chief Financial Officer, decided that the tax department had too many personal for the Corporate Tax duties."
good,This is not the best place to be if you are looking for a team environment. Everyone is out for themselves and not interested in developing careers. Best thing that could have happened to them was being bought out.
good,"Good company to work with , great crew and management as far as you are productive , salary & offshore bonuses can be better, co workers are nice to work with"
good,I am currently working in Russia and looking to work in the US.  I worked for them for many years and it is a decent place to work. I made a lot of friends while working there and met a lot of good managers and some bad managers.
good,"Baker is a company with lots of smart people and great technologies. There are all kinds of opportunities for new comers to explore, domestically and internationally. There are also various programs for employees to grow and excel."
good,"Good place to get your foot in the door and learn in the oil and gas industry. Great training and various positions to work whether it be assemble and test, quality, weld shop, machine shop etc"
good,It was OK. You pretty much did the same job everyday and went home. My coworkers were great but management for the most part could have been better. The work you do for the pay is pretty good.
good,"I work 14 days on and 14 days off in the Gulf of Mexico. I was the Supervisor on a Frac vessel and had 9 personnel working for me. It was a job you love to hate. It had its good and bad points. You are  working with all types of chemicals and hi-pressure pumps. You always need to make sure that all safety and procedure were followed. You always need to be on your toes while a job was going on. But for all of it, I really loved my job. It gave me great satisfaction."
good,Overall good company to work for. Very safety conscious. Many job opportunities   Very good equipment. Good office personal. District yard very good conditions
good,"It was a good company to work for. There are a lot of different departments, so it can be hard to get to know everyone, usually you just stay within your team"
good,No overtime towards the end and base pay was too low without going offshore.  Had to drive to the shop everyday and could no longer afford to do so without overtime.
good,Baker Hughes was a good company to work for before the GE take over.  Once that happened things were terrible.  The management had no idea of what they were doing nor where they were going and they fired a lot of good people in the process.
good,"New employee will be seen as an outsider initially but once your prove yourself technically and bring something of value to the table  you will easily get accepted."
good,"Non è meritocratica, non riconosce i talenti. Si nutre di slogan."
good,A fast paced work environment that offers different challenges daily.  Fair pay and good benefits.  Hours and on call schedule can be long and work/life balance hardly exists.
good,"Punti di forza:"
good,This was my first job with the oil and gas service industry. I learned a lot about how to work within a multi-national organization and gained a tonne of experience with the oil and gas industry. With that I thank Baker Hughes for the opportunity.
good,"Good place to learn "
good,"Between oil price downturns, take-over bids, and management changes, projects and employees are subject to frequent cancelation.  Too many of the better technical jobs have been sent over seas, with inferior results in some cases."
good,"I have learned in the O&G industry that change is constant.  From the change of oil prices, customer's decisions to the direction of the company.  If you are not able to adapt to such changes that will continue for quite some time, then the O&G industry may not be for you."
good,Pay is good but there is poor work-life balance and room for advancement. Well educated and experienced people have very little room to advance their career.
good,I think this was a very cutthroat environment. I would work here again. There was a lack of communication in this job though. It was a great stepping stone.
good,"Was doing great at this job and really like my position. However, when the economy taken in 2009; so did my job with this organization (closed down facility)."
good,"not a bad place to work, very flexible but the oil and gas industry is up and down as is the amount of development work. management don't seem to have much strategy"
good,Not good bad management not good hours market up and down lots of lay offs a lot of mandatory over time rasies are slow to come does not cover cost of living
good,"1. good environment with excellent mentor- mentee program at onboarding"
good,I only worked at Baker Hughes for 8 months as a contractor. I didn't get any benefits from them. They did bring in lunch from time to time which was nice.
good,"work place relaxed, management good."
good,"It is a leading company in oil field services, now baker Hughes merged with GE oil and gas, the company is good , but the management in some areas is so bad"
good,"Baker Hughes is a good Drilling Fluids Company that sells good products, backed up by good service, with good technical support and good support from management. I would recommend them as a prospective employer."
good,"A typical day at work involved working with fellow employees to ensure that the processes and procedures were always running smoothly and consistently."
good,"I enjoyed my work time at Baker Hughes though I could not feel satisfied daily as I was not being challenged to push beyond my comfort zone and break new grounds."
good,"I hired on from a veteran conference as a fishing hand trainee, but this never materialized.  Instead, they made me a warehouse employee and I worked on refurbishing fishing tools. I never recieved the pay or job that I was originally promised.  Beware."
good,The pay is average. They have opportunities all over the world. The oilfield industry is challenging and implements the newest technologies and software.
good,Kelly Professional Services pay rate is extremely fair and competitive for the temporary assignments. Need to have more assignments once completed with one need to have another opportunity to move on to.
good,"Too much travel/ 5 days week "
good,"My main responsable on that was regarding the production planning. I could learn how to do it in a organized and technical way. Regarding my management I believe he could be more focused on our responsibilities. The hardest part of this job was the hard over time almost every day. Because of that I almost lost my year at the university, but I could keep on time after all."
good,"Typical internship experience, more about learning how it feels to come to work in an office environment every day with little useful skills learned other than some basic excel etc."
good,Grande empresa mas como a fabrica era nova necessitava de grandes ajuste.
good,"From my experience they seem to talk a good talk,but are unable to deliver. Upper management is out of touch. Company is top heavy and lacks process control. "
good,"i was hired into an Engineering job as a non Engineer. it was fin in the beginning, but the job was bigger than me and I was terminated. left a bad taste in my mouth"
good,"Good relationship with upper management..."
good,OK typical Oil and Gas Company in the service industry.  Work is good when oil prices are high and stressful when they are low. The combination compounds and results in dysfunction and poor quality.
good,Quick advancements but no job security at all. Typically long days and on call almost all the time.  Management is all about them selfs and does not look out for employees.
good,A highly process driven organization with a focus on developing the next generation technology to stay ahead of the competition. Highly customised solutions developed for the varied profile of Oil & Gas industry customers ranging right from upstream drilling to downstream.
good,"Good pay, good benefits, poor management,  good technology in terms of hardware, horrible outdated software, management not process oriented,  management is incapable of recognising low hanging fruit to increase efficiency or reduce costs, many square pegs stuffed into round holes, bureaucratic, poor execution"
good,Good graduate scheme providing a broad skills base for graduates to further their careers. Good opportunity for travel through the graduate scheme although more limited in the current climate.
good,"Empresa  Multinacional, com grande estrutura. Bom ambiente de trabalho."
good,"Exciting traveling and meeting clients and establishing relationships."
good,"Excelente empresa para começar sua carreira, pois lhe traz uma ótima perspectiva de um ambiente de trabalho minucioso e complexo."
good,this is a decent company to work for. the management is not so great to work with. co- workers are great people and very friendly guys. they know how to have great time .
good,"As an electrical engineer, I enjoyed the technical challenges and the team members. There was never a dull moment. Unfortunately with the downsizing in the Oil and Gas industry made the work environment a fairly cut throat place. Our engineering manager had no experience with electrical design or failures and my team lead had very little engineering experience but they were great at pushing around paperwork. So you and a handful of other people carried the team and the business unit at times with little support. Alot of times a product that hadn't passed design testing would get dropped in your lap and have to be sent patched up and sent to a customer, which at times you could expect ended badly.  So be prepared to play the political game if you like your job and want to keep it. There were alot of dedicated technicians that were excellent to work with. And working in the hive at HTC was definitely a worth while experience and you do learn alot quickly."
good,Enjoyed working here and learning about cable servicing through working as a cable service technician. The position was a good one and I learned a lot.
good,"The people involved in the mud-logging side of the business push themselves to the limits to provide a great service.  At least 99.9% are friendly and dedicated.  From a corporate point of view, mud-logging is one small cog that helps get integrated service jobs.  The focus on pure mud-logging is lacking which has caused the service to be severely cut-down over the past 5 to 10 years.  R&D is poor and the best new ideas have come from individuals pushing their own ideas.  BHI is still a tool company and SLS do not use enough tools that can turn a big profit.  Profit or not, the people are worth every penny and more."
good,"twelve to 14 hour days"
good,"This business manufactures new and re-manufactures hydraulic pumping units and towers. I have learned how to operate in SAP, become more comfortable with Outlook and Xcel. I have learned business processes, take part in conference calls, webex meetings and training. The hardest part is meeting some deadlines when material availability has long lead times."
good,Loved it when I worked here! it was  great job while it was Wood Group Pressure Control but when it merged to GE to me the value went down! the family that we formed broke up and became kind hard to work with.
good,"To work in a premier organisation which gives me ample opportunities to apply my 8+ years of on hand"
good,"It was a very good job. Had a great boss. Great benefits, stock options, 401k and really good insurance. Paid holidays, vacations, sick time and ice days"
good,"Le mie mansioni in qualità di trainer sono diverse, a partire dalla preparazione del materiale didattico customizzato per ogni cliente per proseguire con l’organizzazione della trasferta (visti, voli e sistemazione in loco) e con l’accoglienza del cliente e la capacità di soddisfare ogni sua richieste sia in Italia che all’estero. "
good,great place to work I learned how lng plants work .the co workers where great .Some of the management is ok but some I could live without.
good,"Baker Hughes is a good company to work for.  There are many opportunities to learn and establish your feature.  As all other oil and gas service providers, BHI does offer excellent technology and customer support."
good,Collega's hebben allemaal een no nonsens mentaliteit get the job done and party after.
good,"good schedule to balance life and work, but management tends to be one sided.everyday was different no two work days were alike, because every job you went on was a little bit different."
good,"Edit program set up CNC machinist, meet and exceed production goals. Workplace safety was priority for company, team work was vital to the success of doing business with the company."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,"the general day to day operations with co-workers was generally enjoyable. the only issue was management higher up. A lot of office politics, which led to the closure of the division."
good,Good company with advancement opportunities. The market is pretty tough right now. I know I would still be with them if they didn't shut down so many facilities.
good,"Lot of opportunities when supporting regions."
good,"A chinese family business, and very simple business."
good,The company provided an excellent training campus and above average training. Opportunities for advancement was possible. Good learning experiences
good,"A positive attitude towards work with excellent communication and problem solving skills. Dynamic, result oriented and self-motivated individual able to work effectively either alone or with teams. Systematic, organized attentiveness and able to work under pressure. Strong believer in professional ethics and moral values."
good,"Interesting with good moments. Challenging, engaging, enhancing, educational, productive, refining. Great opportunity to work with different personalities under physically demanding circumstances and achieve together and become friends."
good,En la Cia se vive dia a dia un reto a cumplir y siempre hay soportes que ayudan a realizarlo.
good,"Good workplace, good learning opportunities,"
good,Great company to learn and grow with. Always searching for innovative ways to increase the company bottom line. Safe place to work. Strong team environment.
good,"Great benefits but NO personal life when business is good you are away from family for long periods of time.  Advancement is excellent for the ""go getters""  Over all I liked working there ands my Boss didn't micro manage me."
good,"Working for Baker Hughes was overall not too bad, the only thing that I did not really like was the lack of work/life balance; having to be away from home and family for a majority of your time including weekends started to get taxing. The compensation and benefits were good and the management team I was under were very good and listened to input you gave them. Only reason I do not work there anymore was due to the layoffs currently going on."
good,"As is the nature of my role, I find GE a very challenging and stressful place to work, however this is where I thrive."
good,"Baker Hughes is a good company to work for when the oil market is not in turmoil. When market is up there is plenty of work to do, but less family life. Long hours for non-exempt. Normal work week for exempt employees. Can not complain about benefits."
good,"Twenty five years of experience in Materials/Manufacturing Management including MRP database implementations.  Particularly effective in leading and managing personnel in Procurement, Manufacturing, Quality Control, Production Planning, Scheduling, Material Control, and Logistics, increasing productivity and capacity by following procedures and maintaining safety"
good,"Drive tractor trailer equipment to location , help spot equip. , rig up equip. , work on pumps , run hoses and iron to well head"
good,The communication between the management was poor. other the that everyday would be a little different it was fun most of the time
good,The people at Baker Hughes were easy to get along with and helpful when help was needed.  Management did their best to keep our facility open but with the down turn of oil prices they were not able to keep it open any longer.
good,I will at any time with no hesitation ellaborate more on this company and position at the request of any employer in person or over the phone
good,"furnace drill bits and interact with good people"
good,"En lo laboral es buena empresa, pero el ambiente de trabajo no es muy bueno, poco compañerismo...."
good,"was a great company in the past few years. over time, morale has faded a lot since the announcement of the Halliburton merger"
good,"Picking a packing tools to be exported internationally."
good,"A typical work day ,could be working in any weather at any time.at any hour of the day.you would only get one hour notie before work."
good,reparo de material de bordo - sistema de entretenimento e avionica
good,Nice compensation and ability to grow.  Good work environment.  Productive work days.  Co-workers worked together as a team.
good,"They have good Benefits, and great pay. However they have poor management and basically no job security. The people are awesome and the hardest part of the job is stress."
good,"Great life balance and benefits, poor advancement opportunities. Even though the life-work balance is good, it was almost expected that you work longer to finish projects on time."
good,"The work environment was fine because I had a good boss. Above him the management was poor, and there is no chance for advancement."
good,It was a good training experience. Good people to work with in the field. There were good training courses. My tenure there was very short but enjoyable.
good,"Overall a decent place to work, some facets of local district though were unorganized.  GE does have some of the best benefits out there and when layed off was provided with a decent severance package.  Could be more organized."
good,"When the oil is booming, working at an oil and gas company is a great way to make good money.  When oil prices crash, be sure you didn't get promoted too quickly (making you low man on totem pole for that position during layoffs)"
good,Was reasonable for running a crew. Completing assigned jobs in a timely manner safely. Problem solving on the fly as job was going on. Co-workers were helper and fun to work with. Was on call so was called to work whenever job was required so long days.
good,"poor communication,on call 24/7; 6 days a week.benefits are great,in may we had major layoffs i was the only driver left."
good,"Daily deadlines to process documents within the timelines set down by company and client."
good,"Enjoyable place to work.  Management was supportive and for the most part wanted you to grow and learn, even if that meant changing jobs.  Co-workers were on average easy going and all worked well together to learn from each other and share the knowledge.  Day to day work could sometimes be the same but then some days there was a lot of variety."
good,"when times are food and oil is up its a good place to work, when oil is down start looking for a new job. I would work for Baker in the future."
good,"Lots of learning opportunity and job training. Long, hard hours. Hard to keep a life outside of field work. Great benefits."
good,"Self service. You must to adapt to cold manager and work alone."
good,"Supervisão direta com o cliente."
good,"Everything you would expect from a large corporation. They compensate employees with an occasional t-shirt, a candy bar, a pop, and sometimes a chance for a prize in a drawing.  The employees are typically good to work with."
good,"Make sure you work hard and never challenge office coordinators."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is to have off rotation holiday back home after 28 days of work. A good experience to meet people from different corners of the globe.
good,This is a large company to work for but I was in a layoff. I was employed here for almost 10 years and enjoyed all my experiences that it provided me.
good,"GE is building the world by providing capital, expertise and infrastructure for a global economy. GE Capital has provided billions in financing so businesses can build and grow their operations and consumers can build their financial futures. We build appliances, lighting, power systems and other products that help millions of homes, offices, factories and retail facilities around the world work better."
good,"I generally recommend GE Oil & Gas -- great prospects, excellent organisational experience, excellent work environment, challenging projects"
good,Enjoyed working here in the pressure pumping industry. Decent wages and fair treatment of employees. Would work here again.
good,This job was very easy with not much room to advance.  Almost robotic every day with little change.  Not a lot of room for advancement.
good,"As a HR Business Partner, I ensured that policies were followed and enforced by management.  My overall goal was to ensure that each employee, managers and executive staff had a safe and productive day that was HR motivated."
good,"Arranging the maintenance off offshore equipment. Safety is a key factor in day to day operations. Liasing with different product lines. Setting team goals, training, and competency. Workshop & Office personnel were good to work with but under a lot of pressure. Staffing levels were cut down to the bone. Personnel were made redundant quite quickly due to the current low oil price. Look ahead for upcoming work was not good, forecast poor. Not easy to get equipment repaired as any expenditure was stopped. Job was not enjoyable anymore as there was so many cuts in staff, etc."
good,It was a good place to work with decent benefits and the opportunity to travel.  there was lots of training and a good safety culture
good,I enjoyed working for Baker Hughes as an electronics technician.  The experience and benefits were good.  Thousands of people were laid off because of the Halliburton/Baker Hughes merger.  My only dislike of the company is that local and upper management seem to have very little regard for the technicians who repair the wireline that make them money.
good,"Good training, travel, compensation."
good,"•	Responsible for daily coordination of fulfillment issues related to customer orders, time and material, and component repair processes."
good,Had to be able to work alone and use tools. Great learning and made me want to go to college for a Mechanical Engineering degree.
good,"Es una buena empresa con unos compañeros excelentes, que sacamos muy buenos trabajos apesar de los malos tiempos y de la falta de herramientas y carencia de equipos."
good,Good work space with great opportunities for success. It is a very challenging atmosphere and i enjoyed the challenge because it made me better and more productive. I learned a lot with every project.
good,This was a great role for me. It was my first FP&A role and I received a lot of exposure. Having this operational role helped me a great deal in terms of development.
good,"Lo que mas me gusto de GE fue el desarrollo de proveedores y los retos que representaba este proceso principalmente el competir con proveedores ya calificados , en donde se tenia que implementar un sistema de calidad y procesos que cumplieran con la norma API."
good,"A very messy job, a lot of the equipment was old. Many co-workers did not offer help or knowledge when needed. I learned many, many things about pumping equipment. Hardest part of the day was working outside in the summer. Most enjoyable part of the job was that I was working alone most of the time."
good,"BHI at its best was always striving to compete with the other service companies, That's what made BHI great. They tried harder and truly developed some great products. Ultimately, it's a corporation charged with returning value to the shareholders. While the decision to be purchased by Halliburton is a win for shareholders, it takes some of the competitive fire out of Big Blue employees. Those who are fortunate to stay will hopefully become part of a new competitive culture.  "
good,Baker Hughes is an amazing place to work and they give you so many training which helps you to learn and grow not only in career but in character as well.
good,"Started right out of college and was asked to move into better jobs. Then oil bottoms out and I am laid off as a part of company wide RIF. "
good,The hardest part of the job was losing it.  Very structured and tracking devices in place for accountability. Good pay and benefits.
good,"I wore many hats,  I learned many sales and technology skills."
good,"On call 24/7 live by a phone "
good,really don't have much to say.  the bank is behind in technology.  You can only work with what they have to offer.  they may have improved their technology since then
good,"I learned lot from GE ,About saifty,team work,reporting work problem,"
good,"Based on my experience, Baker Hughes is a pretty standard company. They usually pay well to start, management is hit or miss, and promotions don't always happen in a reasonable amount of time. Like any workplace, there are going to be good and bad qualities, and they will vary from group to group. As with almost any energy company, job security is lower than average."
good,good company to work for good stablility but benifits could be better. Chances for advancement was dificult for one who did not have a college degree watched several people get looked over for promotions due tonot having a degree. HR department made you feel like a number every time you had a question they wanted your employee number instead of your name
good,"Good company, flexible management, great benefits coworkers are enjoyable and you will learn a lot about the oil field services industry while working for Baker Hughes. Hardest part of the job are the physical aspects."
good,"Era una buena empresa"
good,Good company. Any ways it will change as Haliburton acquired Baker :)
good,Started off as a pump truck driver worked my way up the ladder as a tech where I would work on pumps and find solutions for chemical usage
good,Don't fool yourself in to thinking that one oil field job is better than the other...I am sure that somewhere this may be proven but in the two years I have worked in the oilfield and spoke to many people in different jobs and with different companies one observation continues to surface:  INCOMPETENT MANAGEMENT!  That being said there is money to be made if you can put up with managers who know nothing about managing people and a career path that is limited if you aren't a good old boy.  These comments may seem negative and they are but the cash flow can be exceptional if you are willing to give the oilfield your time and commitment.  So long story short BH is as good as any oilfield services company I have seen and maybe one step better at safety which is important because this work is dangerous.  I don't know what they will be like now that the evil empire has eaten them (Halliburton) but they were a sound company with good benefits when I worked there.
good,A decent place to work if you are a single person. Travel a lot to find the work and live in motels up to two weeks. Great pay and benefits.
good,"FES, solids control tech is a great job within the oilfield. The knowledge and experience I have makes it a great fit. The men that I work with here are good, knowledgeable, hard working people. The treatment from management is less than normal and very unprofessional"
good,very knowledgeable people fun to work with the hardest part of the job is working in a non air conditioned shop
good,"An experienced Project Planner with a proven track record of success in the Oil & Gas industry. Providing strategic planning, implementation and delivery control to build consistently improved Programme and Project performance."
good,"I enjoyed working at Baker Hughes for the short time that it lasted.  I was satisfied in my position and provided excellent service and skills.  Too bad they had to reduce the workforce, or I would still be there."
good,"Don Green - Covering letter."
good,This was a very physical job that required a lot of attention to detail.
good,"safety meeting,job problem list,assist mechanics with problems,computer work.communicate with other departments about  equipment problems."
good,* In charge of supervising the counting of the inventory cycle and restocking.
good,"constante seguimiento y control a los aliados estratégicos involucrados en la cadena logística del proceso de importación y nacionalización, mucha presión de los clientes internos en la reducción de leadtime de las nacionalizaciones entrega del bien final."
good,"Baker hires very good people and has decent equipment at their disposal. They pay a very fair and decent wage to their employees as well as having a very nice benefit package.  "
good,"A typical day at work is action packed, full of excitement and never a dull moment.  Management is supportive in order to meet strategic business goals. Everyone is focused in order to get the job done and meet strategic business needs."
good,"A good experience working there, but I believe working there for a long time is uncertain at best due to excessive outsourcing."
good,"Only offshore operation which is very tiresome"
good,"Review six product lines at Baker Facility's (60% travel) for internal API, Q1 & ISO 9001 compliance audits. Perform supplier audits adding to Bakers Approved Suppliers list. Classroom train Lead Auditors and managers in the techniques of non-destructive testing (current ASNT Level III in Visual, Dye Penetrant and Magnetic Particle Testing). Subject Matter Expert (SME) in NDT & Welding Processes (Will be certified CWI in May 2014). Review and approve testing and welding processes and approve procedures."
good,"My typical work day is very fastpaced. I do drumming and toting of chemicals. I make up empty drums getting them ready for filling. I have a various amount of job duties."
good,"Muy bueno el ambiente de trabajo, aprendí mucho tanto en lo profesional como en lo humano. La dirección y gerencia muy buenas, mis colegas extraordinarios. La parte mas difícil del trabajo cuando hubo reducción del personal y tuve que decidir quien se quedaba y quien tenia que marcharse. Me gustó todo en la empresa, su gente, lo mucho que aprendí. Mis mejores recuerdos laborales los tengo de Baker Hughes (Antigua Venezolana de Resinas)"
good,"Medical, Dental, 401 K and discounted Stock Purchase Plan."
good,Great company to work for and plenty of overtime for now. Very safe place to work.
good,solid company I was a very dedicated employee I felt the company was a good company to work for however I wanted to be promoted but it was not possible at this company.
good,"A Joint Venture of PVD and Baker Hughes.  Working day from Monday to Friday. Learn more SAP, Hyperion system."
good,"We had a very high-energy, fast paced work environment. Smaller projects would come in and go back out very quickly. Even some of the larger projects, such as trade shows would have extremely tight deadlines we would have to meet. I was able to learn a lot while working there, not only about the industry but about the products and services we provided. I was on a team of 10 (including my immediate supervisor) we had to work together on multiple larger projects to meet deadlines, each person taking on one piece of the larger picture. The hardest part of the job was the demand, even though there was so much demanded of our team and individually we somehow were always able to get the job done and meet the expectations of each client. The best part of the job was definitely the people, I loved the group I worked with, not just my team but the people I would interact with everyday."
good,"I worked here for several years and worked my way up from painter, to assembly mechanic, to inspector. The pay was much better than what I was used to initially. We worked 60-80 hours a week, it was great for me at the time. As time went on and I grew I found that it was very difficult to get a pay increase, based on knowledge and certifications. Typically additional certifications translates into pay compensation, but not at GE. The pay rate you start at is where you will stay, and if you don't have a degree then it is unlikely you will get promoted. The operations leader role is a position they do not take seriously because they put people in the role that have no clue what's going on. Another issue is that the operations leaders think that the best way to save money is cutting overtime so now everyone works 40 hours. It put several employees in a tough financial situation because their salaries were reduced by 40-50% with no hourly rate change to compensate for lost time."
good,"A typical day at work: Confusion. Our customer does not always order everything they need which causes extra work and excessive cost."
good,Work on average an 8 hour day. My time at Bakers has taught me leadership skills and the importance of team work and deadlines. I am responsible for Health and Safety in my department and am also a trained first aider. I feel increasingly frustrated  at the lack of opportunities for someone of my age and experience. I enjoy the work I do but need a new challenge.
good,will I learned what fracing was allabout.management was ok.the hardest part of the job was riging up& riging down.the most enjoyable part of the job is when coil tubing went down hole.
good,"the job is ok,long hours.work on trucks make ready for road trips.pms on engines an equipment.other than hours like it."
good,Drove cement/ nitrogen equipment to locations for work all over the United States.
good,Busy work environment. No room for advancement though. A change in employee housing made it tough to adjust too. Over all good company but lacked a challenge and refreshing daily duties.
good,The compay is great to work for. Air conditioned shop. Only work every forth weekend. Hollidays paid. Start off with one week sick leave and 2 weeks paid vacation. That being said the company is very hard to move up in tech levels and upper management. Unless you satisfied working 7-3:30 with low potential and not in a hurry to advance.
good,"ter compromisso com a empresa"
good,Highly evolving and faced paced drilling tool shop. Everyday provides new challenges. This shop puts out more tools than any other Baker Hughes shop while maintaining HS&E and following procedures.
good,Its strength is its weakness as well.  Everything is by the book and expericnce is nothing..  Only degrees matter
good,"Pros: Great team members, lots of different systems to learn, laid back atmosphere"
good,"E uma empresa boa de se trabalhar, oferece muitas vantagens aos  e uma estabilidade muita boa aos funcionários. Como em toda empresa existem os bons e maus colegas, mas procuro fazer o meu trabalho da melhor forma e com toda segurança e me dar bem na medida do possível com todos. Últimamente o que me motiva mais a saír é realmente a vontade de voltar a atuar na minha área de atuação antiga e por questão de promoção que a muito tempo não sai"
good,"As a process field specialist and account manager a typical work days require a large predisposition toward on-site client management, constant ""after-sales"" support, and process troubleshooting. This takes place at site-specific facilities in a common effort to produce adequate sales-grade oil in the most cost-effective and efficient manner."
good,"long days, and long nights... truckdriving and pressure pumpingg..."
good,I loved the management. My co-workers were great. The job was not challenging. I loved the commute
good,Bakers Hughes was a good job until I got laid off. They have really good benefits I wish I was still employed there.
good,"Not much to say, short term contract, not enough time to evaluate company although it does seem like a good company if you are an actual employee."
good,"management wasn't the best, and i left because at the time it just wasn't very busy"
good,A typical day at work for me would be engaged in a team environment providing support and celebrating success. I've learned that engaging employees in a positive way helps to promote success. Managers are a critical resource in employee development and growth within an organization. My co-workers are always willing to help when there is a problem that needs to be resolved. The hardest part of my job is finding my home life and work balance because I never stop working. The most enjoyable part of my job is my customer and employees satisfaction.
good,Good work schedule considering its an oil field job. Per Deim could have been better. Training wasn't what I thought it would be. Promised a lot of stuff but never delivered.
good,Working for this company is a great opportunity and being able to learn all the functions of cementing in the oilfield.
good,"No job security but a good working environment, good career progression and good benefits, standard training for new hires but top management decisions are poor"
good,"Can't really speculate, as I worked there when it was just GE Oil & Gas."
good,I found it to be a boring  job. Monitor  drilling  operations and log into reports. I didn't  care for it bc I'm more  outgoing and  likes to be able  to  get outside  and do activities  besides  being  stuck in a box all day. Not a job for me
good,When it was BJ Service enjoyed working there then sold to Baker Hughes things changed how they ran things company wide. more worried about making money instead of trying to keep experience people to do day to day operations safely. Do more for less.
good,Ottima possibilita' di crescita professionale. Situazione piu' difficile per chi ha famiglia
good,it was a very good job i learned a lot and i found what can cannot do in the work in the work place i was at at the time i got to learn more than i thought
good,"Normal day consist of monitoring tool functionality on computer workstations, taking directional surveys and insuring all down hole data is valid.  About 10 to 20 percent physical labor on days when having to rig jobs up or down.  The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with other employees."
good,the company has very nice culture and friendly management and teams. the bad part is the long work that has bad work-life balance and adds a lot of stress.
good,"I work as a field employee. The pay can be very good, but when you're working you'll work at least 12 hours a day. When you're not in the field you're on-call and can pretty much just do what you want and get paid a guaranteed 40 hours per week. Learned a lot of technical knowledge about the drilling tools. Almost everything I've learned is not applicable to any other industry than oil and gas. Management can be awesome and understanding, but occasionally seriously drop the ball, forcing you to work more and/or for 36-48 hours with no sleep."
good,Good place to work but poor organisation makes it a frustrating place to work. Salary/benefits all very good but could be so much better place to work at.
good,"i  had a  bad  supervisor ,  was  not  fair .  they  need    to improve  and be  fair   with hard workers .    But working with compeny was good.   "
good,"Supervise and train other Field Operators while maintaining a high level of safety awareness at the well site. Coordinate employee activities, handle personel functions and verify that needed items are available. Work closely with my team to maintain a high level of safety and always looking for opportunities if improvement, using Guardia to submit safety related observations. Promote and maintain good customer relations. Rigging up and rigging down equipment at well site. Maintain well site and DOT records and communications as required. Service mechanical devices and building logging cable heads. Preparing jobs and performing tool maintenance, pre-job and post-job tool checkout."
good,"Solid place to work, has its pros and cons. Lots of the enjoyment you get from your work is finding the right location and or group to work in for you."
good,Ample opportunities to shine on highly complex and technical projects. Multiple high performing individuals drive a culture of excellence. Leadership turnover is a constant issue.
good,"Hectic working day, too much fire-fighting, good quality culture within business, good opportunities to train and progress, enjoyed the travel, generally working with good people, but business initiatives are initiated at corporate level without consideration of their effect at the coal face"
good,"We were laid off-"
good,Worked in this company for over 5 years. Harsh lay-offs due to O&G business climate.  There are multiple avenues for advancement if you are willing to work within the system.
good,"I had fun from being a worker to a lead man to a supervisor. Unfortunately when i became a supervisor and a mentor, everyone was getting paid more than me and the company didn't want to raise my pay. So I got stuck getting paid less than my leads and other advance workers."
good,"Went through mergers which offered many new challenges and changing processes"
good,"Good company to work for since its a big company and secure, but jobs are not really secure since you can be put on hold or layed off depending on the project"
good,"-Agréable"
good,"Management are very approachable and they will listen to what you have to say."
good,"Demanding company to reach business goals, difficult to keep balance between work and family nevertheless the right place to learn to work in a multicultural, worldwide company"
good,"Oil Field downturn was the reason for not still working in this industry, enjoyed the compensation. Would love to be back in this job routine. Everyday is a new experience in the oil field."
good,"a typical work day start with cup of coffee. then with a safety meeting on a particular safety topic of the week, and the review of the safety issue of the previous week. "
good,I was there for a short time but got a very helpful and patience trainer. Great environment especially lunch areas.  Likes the 2 breaks and 1 - 20 minutes pay lunch.
good,"The work atmosphere is not conducivie to a productive environment, you never know when you will get a pink slip.  That may have changed with an uptick in oil and gas jobs, but when they were being bought out by Halliburton they were only concerned with the shareholders, not the ones that were getting the job finished."
good,"Typical Day"
good,It was a good 6 years but unfortunately oil has effected hours of work. Would stay here but doesn't look like much work is forecasted. Therefore looking for a steady career.
good,No job schedule makes personal life hard to manage. Overall the work is pretty good and most people you work with are enjoyable. If there was a set schedule it might not be such a bad job. Lots of travel and being away from home
good,"Operations is where to go, If you work for a high revenue sector you will be paid well. AMO is not worth working for unless you are in the rotator pool."
good,Great benefits and co-workers were always eager to help. The downside is the amount of time on the road and out in the field away from family. But the time away was well compensated by the company.
good,Many friendly colleagues but not a rewarding environment for those that like to work in a high performance culture or want to make things more efficient and challenge the status quo. Most times mediocre is good enough. Lots of room for improvements
good,Fast paces work in the production world.  Your are challenged often to perform at a very high level but they pay above average.
good,The company cares for their employees by giving them access to numerous training courses to help them develop of his/her career path. They have very competitive wages and incredible benefit packages.
good,"Learn great skills and full support from ex-manager"
good,"Lots of work when it's busy, sweep the floors when it's quiet.Angry bully type management. Finger pointing for mistakes. weak training practices. Strong safety culture unless a job ""had"" to be done."
good,When the market is up your constantly working long hours but long hours means a lot more money. Most of the co workers are great to work with which is good because sometimes the place can get overwhelming with the work load. Management is constantly hovering over you about work even when you have finished a job.
good,"Maintained quality standards by approving incoming materials, in process production, and finished products; recording quality results."
good,"I do not want to review Baker Hughes, this is a big company, but it is disappearing, merged with Halliburton. There will be no Baker Hughes in several months."
good,"OK place to work, not much room for growth. Lately a very unstable job security due to oil prices. Work/life balance is good. Depends on position. Compensation is competitive."
good,"I learned more about myself working here, because of the people around me. I am thankful for that."
good,Baker Hughes was once a great place to work. Yes the Oil and gas industry has its ups and downs but Baker Oil Tools was notorious for not laying off as badly as the other companies or even within the Baker family. Their were great people to learn from but that is all gone and so are the people. the culture is one of fear and dread of being layed off to make numbers for the corporate office.
good,"Everyday was a day filled with surprises, good and bad. As being at the end of the supply chain, onus was on us (manufacturing/build team) to deliver the customer what exactly they wanted in time and 100% quality."
good,"""assistant supervisors"" are at the mercy of their ""current"" managers (which are constantly changing)the pay is good but you end up wishing that you were back on a machine."
good,"we did not have a high turn over rate, everyone had at least three years working there.  That made it easy to understand and accept day to day operations in the shop and in the field.  we all got along great and worked well as a team which made it easy to have a SAFE and Productive work day."
good,"Challenging day to day, which was a good thing.  Hardest part of this job is being gone from home for weeks at a time, especially with a family. Awesome  comradery with my coworkers."
good,"Overall a good place to work with its set of upsides and challenges."
good,"An engineer will find the environment challenging, fast paced, but with opportunities to gain valuable experience on a variety of projects. This is a large organization and there are frequent changes in leadership. It's easy to feel lost in this kind of environment, but if you join a group that is stable then you will enjoy your job and learn a lot."
good,"Nice place to work, with great co-workers.  There was a lot of red tape and politics with certain supervisors.  The most enjoyable of the job was working alongside my colleagues, learning from them and share my experience with my colleagues."
good,"I am challenged every day.  Great work environment.  I learn a great deal everyday."
good,"Was a good company to work for, I liked my boss and the people I worked with for the most part, but the hours were too much to keep a happy family. 100 Hr. weeks can take a toll on your body and after 3 years was too much to try to continue.  Was 24 hrs on call every day of the year except for my 10 vacation days. Was very difficult trying to get a day off sometimes only once a month, and even the days off would be to play catch up on paperwork. Boss was good about letting us sleep if we told him we absolutely couldn't drive but would push you until you said it absolutely couldn't be done."
good,This is a good place to work for self starters who want to make a difference but not a good place if you are looking to learn best practices from a top company.
good,"Facilitate employee engagement and help drive safe culture throughout Permian Basin."
good,I worked for the coiled tubing division and they shut down the whole product line.  Therefore there is no longer an Account Coordinator position for Baker Hughes Coiled Tubing.
good,"Of the big three oilfield services corporations, probably the best to work for."
good,"Typical work day: "
good,"job duites were awesome benfits were the best ive ever seen with a company just no place to advance, best co workers, horrible hours, great pay."
good,"I started from basics, went on job by job daily routine tools preparations, equipment maintenance, from on call jobs rig up and running the tools in the well. Until they promoted me for my hardwork and technical skills display."
good,"The day starts at 8am preparing reports about deliveries and internal stats, looking for the daily activities of the team and helping the team to solve daily issues. Contact suppliers to manage the order placed until all daily issues are closed"
good,Need to be a very mechanicaly inclined person to work there. There was a lot of knowledge to gain in regards to the oil industry.
good,"La empresa debe hacer  cumplir con las políticas corporativas y de seguridad sin distinción desde la más alta gerencia al nivel mas Bajo,"
good,"The upside: When I first started working at Baker, I only had a class 5 drivers licence, I was flat broke, and wasn't expecting much. After the first month, they put me through training and paid for my class 1 licence, dozens of safety tickets, and all of my ppe. By the third month, I was making good money and after getting laid off, Baker gave me a huge amount of money for a severance package. I learned A LOT working for Baker. How to work safely, work on the trucks, even how to act in the field - It was my first oilfield job. Lots of heavy lifting. Managed to lose 10 pounds working for them and my arms got huge. The management at Baker was great. Really good guys (and girls) working in the office. Very well mannered, professional, and fair. A lot of the older guys I worked with had a great sense of humor"
good,"The work was challenging and engaging. I heighten my organizational skills and learned to keep proof of conversations. The co-workers/working environment was welcoming. "
good,"hard cost reductions"
good,"Office and Field Experience, Mixed review between both. Each division and field place is different from the rest, depends largely on manager."
good,"Within my time working at GE i ahave learned a lot and improved my mechanical knowledge. I have always worked for engineering based companys and GE provides a good challege and room to learn."
good,"Everyday at work comes up with it own challenges but most notable was yesterday experience where we nearly lost a contract from our major client due to logistics issues.After the investigation we were able to find the root causes and put some corrective actions in place to prevent a re occurrence."
good,Empresa consistente e totamente envolvida com a segurança dos funcionários.
good,"Its a busy place always something happening ,good co workers ,im always learning which i enjoy."
good,"Um dia tipico de trabalho engloba trabalho em equipe, pressão, comunicação, dinamismo e principalmente proatividade. Existe situações dificeis no trabalho como a estadia em uma plataforma de petroleo, as vezes em condições ruins, porém também beneficia pela folga."
good,"12 hour shifts"
good,"Writing daily reports, inspecting the entire site, finding and resolving problems that may occur during drilling."
good,"This is a good company, a good place to work."
good,"Drive semi truck to locations, rig up, install cable and submerible pumps or pull pumps."
good,"Strong company , stable,and great benefits. Well maintained equipment."
good,Stable company with locations all over the world and endless work
good,"When I have time to sit down and think of this topic on a more extensive basis, I will come back and elaborate on my overall review of my current company ."
good,"•	Provided onsite safety training to 20 workers on Monthly basis"
good,"A typical day at work is stressful, it involved lots of heavy lifting. What I learned here was a lot of things about the oil field and the safety protocal. The management was somewhat good but stressful at times. The workplace culture was not very diverse. The hardest part of the job is dealing with brownnoser and backstabbers. The most enjoyable part of the job was driving out of town delivery."
good,Awesome introduction into the oil and gas world. Helpful teammates and great workplace atmosphere. Fast paced environment which tested my ability to compromise or have a plan B and C in most situations.
good,People there were friendly.more breaks.lots of job security because there was always work.you can also learn different things from different department
good,"Working at Baker is productive.  The hardest part of the job is the pay is not equal to the cost of living in the community in which I live.  Over time pay is available, which I complete on a weekly basis."
good,Average place to work. Good work/life balance. Smart employees and generally talented work environment. Sometimes too much uncertainty in direction of the business.
good,Worked with a group of great people but there are several issues where leadership was lacking in holding persons accountable which creates a culture of pockets of people avoiding responsibility.
good,"Work in remote locations and in all weather conditions., lots of hours spent driving. Great benefits and wage. Additional training provided both within the company."
good,"I am legacy Baker Hughes.  As a BHGE employee, I am having to learn and strive in a new culture. I am not as confident in Talent Management as part of the new company. I feel less secure in my job and especially with career advancement opportunities."
good,"The company culture praises the engineers and those in the gas field, while business support staff such as HR, Technology, Accounting, etc. do not receive the same level of recognition."
good,Very difficult to advance.  Do not get the feeling that this company values their employees.  Management seems to make one decision after the other in that they exercise poor judgement.
good,Quick paced environment due to oil and gas market requirements. Many organizational changes in a span of 5 years that make long term strategies challenging to follow.
good,Baker Hughes a GE Company is evolving as a new company. Company is going through Post Merger stages and environment is still changing. Both company's cultures are still being aligned. Lots of headcount reduction.
good,managers were doing very good when it was at the other company that was before until GE came along and fired all the personal with the experience and business went down and were doing lay offs and then it came to me. What ever that they had promise to get better and more money and no raise for 3 years.
good,GE taking over which limits upward mobility for legacy BHI finance employees.  Workplace morale is currently shaky depending on product line.  Great experience but caution should be taken to ensure GE takeover will not make you redundant.
good,Baker acquired BJ services with whom I had been employed for 15 years. the combination of a manufacturer buying a service company and then facing a drastically reducing market was very difficult. Eventually I left to take a retirement package.
good,"It was a great company to work for. Like any big org, lots of office politics and constant changes. Lots of layoffs (i included) so the atmosphere during my tenure was unstable at best. With that said, I would not mind another opportunity with GE O&G now BAKER HUGHES a ge company."
good,GE is a  wonderful company to work with. Provides you with opportunities to be a part of a company which is going to change the world. Ample learning for business leaders and core domain experts.
good,I really enjoyed working here.  Great people work here with great loyalty.  Strong technical knowledge is a standard and you can learn an assortment of product in the oilfield
good,"During my time in the company,"
good,"Hours are long some days, but great people to work with overall. Plenty of benefits, both incentive wise and non-incentive too."
good,"Great benefits, opportunity for growth, but not much of a life work balance.  I suppose it depends on what division or field you are in, for my field and expertise the life work balance did not exist."
good,Substantial income - very unstable company.  Thousands of lay offs.  Merger with Halliburton fell through.
good,The location I worked at was shutdown about 2 years ago becuase Managment lost ALOT of money on a job and so they let go most of the employees to try and counter the loss and that blew up in there face.
good,There were good times and bad as is usual with any job but working with the HR department was more difficult than it needed to be.Management was a generally good bunch and days were very long. The worst part of the job was enforcing the vast amount of safety and environmental policies mandated by the state and federal government The best part of the job was the people that I came in contact with on a daily basis!!.
good,"Good Management system"
good,"Any work schedule"
good,"Typical day consist of traveling to a client site testing, commissioning our ILI tools, conducting site specifics, safety orientations, working along side various crews, understanding operations for each particular job. Sometimes having to deviate from plans due to safety risks. The most enjoyable part about my job is I travel nationwide 100%"
good,its a time to learn something and reach my  target and Great Infrastructure. The culture is great too. Mysore training is like heaven. Perfect start for freshers.
good,"Baker Hughes is an okay place to work.  Priorities are all backwards and the BIG WIGS are all money hungry and just care about their pockets. Co-Workers for the most part are all okay.  Typical day all depends on the department.  Most enjoyable part of the job is 55 o'clock.  Let's be serious, nobody wants to work, we have to."
good,"Det er mange kjekke kolleger på arbeid, mange av dem er unge. Under min tid på Baker Hughes har jeg lært å takle tidspress på en positiv måte, samtidig som jeg får lære bort noe som jeg kan til andre. Det er stor lærlingmiljø på arbeid ettersom bedriften satse på lærlinger. Det er vanskelig å bli lagt merke til av det man gjør ettersom firma er stor. Lederkultur i bedriften forandre seg hele tiden ettersom firma skifter ledelse nesten hvert år, noe som jeg syns er kjedelig. Mest av alt så er arbeidsmiljø ganske bra på jobb."
good,I loved going to work every morning and the working atmosphere was excellent. I loved doing my job and working hands on with their tools
good,"A typical day at work included many meetings and interactions with colleagues.  I learned a lot about the oil & gas industry and most recently learned about being a business leader.  Some managers have been good mentors but for the most part they have allowed me the freedom to be autonomous, which I like.  The hardest part of the job is trying to work in a matrix environment where goals and objectives are not necessarily aligned.  I really enjoyed working internationally and meeting customers all over the world."
good,"Typical day was being called in by Dispatch not knowing where you going to be sent. Learned to work different groups and multiple managers. Management well what can i say not very organized. "
good,"Typical day at work called in to either drive a truck to location or whatever they needed. Learned to drive long distances on the road to different places out of Texas. Management well, very undecided on the decision making. Co workers very easy to get along with and very helpful on training different pieces of equipment. The hardest part of my job is not knowing what they had planned for you to do or where they would send you. And trying to adjust to unplanned decisions and changes on the go without warning. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my fellow co workers learning the ropes thru them."
good,objetiva resultados utilizando tripés sólidos de avaliação e possui um ambiente bom de trabalho.
good,"Management is good, i work by myself with help from"
good,Good people with a good family environment. Good pay and benefits.
good,"A friendly place to work with good facilities and excellent benefits, but mediocre management. "
good,"O trabalho na base se resume a organização do setor e manutenção de equipamentos que estão prestes a embarcar, muito importante para adquirir conhecimento. Tais como manutenção de bomba triplex e operação de unidades de bombeio, conhecimentos específicos como a igualdade das medidas dos pistões e sua máxima pressão e vazão, quantidade de barris bombeados tendo resultados como tempo e vazão por exemplo. Equipe de coordenadores e gerentes altamente qualificados pois adquiriram bastante conhecimento em sua história de empresa. Boas amizades dentro da empresa com os colegas de trabalho. A parte mais difícil é a escala de embarque já que não é uma escala fixa impossibilitando a conclusão do ensino superior para quem tem como objetivo a formação superior."
good,Baker Hughes was an enjoyable place to work. My coworkers where great. I got to meet many new people. Hardest part of the job was the drive
good,"When I got hired on full time I was pretty stoked. I had heard a lot of great things about Baker. However, either a lot has changed since the ""glory days"", or people were being slightly misleading. The health/dental/401k benefits are awesome, as well as being able to balance work and home life. Management is generally willing to work with you so that you can get on a shift/schedule for you to take care of your family. All of the co-workers are pretty easy to work with as well and your day is planned out for you when you get to work 90% of the day. That's all they have going good though. When you're trying to find better job opportunities through Baker (via another plant or department in the plant you're at) they play a bunch of political games and block you. Regardless if you're moving up in shift (such as 3rd to 1st), or if you're getting paid more, or both. And to top it all off, the raises are pathetic. Unless you get into the ""inner circle"", as it's known at Baker, you're not going to get to advance unless you've been there for 20 years. Also, Upper Management has a bad habit of straight out lying to your face about job opportunites/compensation."
good,"The minute I step foot in my office, I hit the ground running. I receive 100-150 emails per day that must be read and most of them require replies. I work closely with the redistribution warehouse and Logistics on all shipments that are going export. I ensure NOR's are accurate and ready dates are acceptable to meet the projects and/or customer's deadlines. I follow up with my vendors on any open and existing orders as well as keeping lead times updated for all raw materials purchased.I create purchase orders, sales orders and review RFQ's once they have been approved by Strategic Sourcing to ensure material requested is available to meet the customers required date(s). I back up all domestic buyers as needed."
good,Large company were you are just a number on paper.  the people are great for the most part and the benefits are wonderful.  Managment does not have much of an idea what we do or have to put up with in the field.
good,"I worked for BH for 12 years.  I was unfortunately laid off during the downturn in 2015 - 2016.  The oil & gas industry can be a great industry, but there are some very volatile moves up and down and in oil prices and this can cause significant hiring episodes as well as massive lay-offs when things go south."
good,"Empresa demandante, onde se trabalha muito, mas com retorno interessante, tanto de aprendizado quanto financeiro."
good,I enjoyed working at BHI during my time there.  The culture was dynamic and fast paced.  Being in OFS you're always going to be compensated a little differently than at a major or at an independent firm. Don't know how culture has changed now with BHGE.
good,The GE management allow you to have a flexible work time frame to allow you to cover the task that life throw at you during day time. Also able to work from home.
good,Great place only stressful because job security depends on economy and supply and demand of oil. Experienced a lot of layoffs . Pay deduction and hour deduction. Other than that great job.
good,"Excellent management. Poor work life balance. Good compensation and benefits, would be better if a rotation was offered. Extreme amount of hours worked."
good,The company has certainly changed a lot since it is part of GE . I did not find the culture very constructive when I was there. There are debates as the pertinence of Predix in the O&G sector
good,GE in Jacksonville was a brand new facility that was built without the proper structure and foundation in place from an operational standpoint. Communication and accountability was poor at the time
good,"When it's good, it's great!  But when they aren't making money or doing well in the markets, it's bad.  No job security within this field of employment."
good,Lots of hours in the field and on call during work rotation. The pay was good. Not real flexible with time off. Requires a life style change. Would work there again.
good,"I have nothing bad to say about Baker Hughes besides that every 5-6 years (it seems like) Lay-offs happen. seems like some people get favored, but other then that the company is a great place. good people and a good place to learn."
good,"Great learning experience. Co-workers were great. Hardest part of the job was leaving the family for long periods. Management has ups and downs, but for the most part they were great."
good,"Quisiera formar parte de esta empresa para poder tener un salario digno , para poder aprender y crecer día a dia"
good,"Multicultural environment with a lot of possibilities to develop your career and grow in knowledge in many different areas."
good,"Not the company it was when I worked there before. To much bureaucracy now. Felt like I was not part of the team anymore the last year I worked there.  It was just a job, not a career. For the most part my co-workers were good."
good,"Overall a decent company to work for, a typical work day was very busy. Excellent benefits, wonderful coworkers, team atmosphere."
good,"Good overall experience.  With the downturn in the oil and gas industry, management changed with diversification and lost its ""family"" feel.   Many program and standardization changes made it difficult to be completely productive."
good,"Creo que en esta gran empresa hubiéramos dado mas un servidor y varios de nuestros colegas, siento que don de se dio la debilidad fue en las partes a nivel gerencia"
good,Uma empresa que preza pela boa convivência de forma geral. É claro que existem exceções.
good,"Uma das líderes mundiais de prestação de serviços de petróleo e a cada dia adequa ainda mais os funcionários a uma cultura interdependente. Possui uma excelente equipe de trabalho com pessoas extremamente competentes.  Sujeita a possíveis impecilhos que serão acarretados devido a uma mudança de localização de base, onde futuramente terá de dividir um espaço menor que o atual com diferentes linhas de produto e compartilhar das mesmas ferramentas que antes eram exclusividade."
good,"A typical day at work for me is quite slow, I keep track of fuel and work in SAP on a regular basis but most other duties are monthly and don't require much upkeep throughout the rest of the month. I am looking for something where I can be busy throughout most of the day. There is not much room for advancement in my position and that is certainly something I am looking for. I work very well with my coworkers when the need arises and the hardest part of my job is finding things to keep me busy. The most enjoyable thing is certainly the people I work with."
good,You can make a lot of money and hours in the oil and gas industry. There is not much time for personal time with family.
good,"Interviewed for, and offered one position. Showed up for work where I  was told I was in a different position. Too many others to list"
good,"Meu dia a dia na Baker é muito corido, pois atendo aos solicitantes internos, fazendo cobranças de materiais a serem entregues. Dou suporte aos compradores. Não vejo dificuldades, pois sou muito dinamica e quando tenho duvidas, eu busco conhecimentos para ajudar aos solicitante, e com isso obtenho mais aprendizado."
good,Typical day at work we would relieve day/night shift and start our task caping guns or breaking down guns. There’s also times we would rig down or rig up move our equipment to or from location.
good,"At Baker Hughes, you get to meet a lot of people at different levels of management, interact and learn from them. Everybody is approachable. The work there is also challenging, which will help you as a beginner."
good,"Baker Hughes was a solid company. It recognizes ""high-potential"" employees and seeks to maximize their development and visibility. I was one of those and appreciate all of the experience. However, now having worked for another company for three years, I realize that BHI has much work to do in terms of aligning priorities, minimizing ""politics"" and driving speed within their supply chains. Support was not always given for critical requirements, and you were asked to make do with limited resources, even for a billion dollar business unit."
good,"Flexible day and multi function exposure along with the opportunity to manage the teams and work with the management, very well diversified culture."
good,Every day was different and exciting.There was alot off changes that came with my work.But i was very worth the stress .I can say it was a great work enviroment.
good,Baker Hughes is very employee friendly and is the best place to work. The company provides a lot of opportunities for growth and development.
good,Driving the lean continuous improvement program through the business.  Weekly review of cost of quality for scrap and rework.  Business is slowing down due to the oil industry downturn.  Team are working hard to bring in more orders.  I am passionate about culture of the business but finding it hard in the current climate of uncertainty.
good,"Recommends"
good,Baker Hughes strives for the success of its employees. They better the value half of each employee and make it a safe environment for everyone to work at.
good,"Was a great job to of had. Baker Hughes was on outstanding company with Integrity, Teamwork, Learning  and Performance and Safety. I've Recently Retired and now looking for a Part-Time job to compensate my social security."
good,Baker has great training good managers and is a good place to have a career don't expect to get ahead overnight but if you stay in for the long haul its a dang good place to work
good,Enjoyed working a Baker Hughes. Strong Company and technologically advanced. Management is good and advancement is very real. Baker believes in work life balance and has a strong focus on safety and continuous learning.
good,This company has some management problems however at the end of the day Honestly they treat their workers well! 
good,I love working at Baker Hughes. It affords me a good salary and good working conditions but wayyyyyyyyy too many meetings which distract the operations that we have to complete on a daily basis
good,"Worked in several functional areas in Finance, for more than 22 years. Special focus in the last 7 years was in Manufacturing Finance, Cost Control, Inventory Management and Internal Controls."
good,Company is all about the numbers and cutting back due to the slow done with oil production and buy out from other oilfield company
good,My focus was to help the compagny grow and assisst my colleagues to work as a team.To achieve a quality job for the compagny
good,"Seeking a Long Term career with a strong and progressive company. I bring with me great communication skills, leadership, loyalty, and honest hard work."
good,"Did daily task of servicing equipment,cleaning and getting reports and mud weights.  Learned to communicate better with fellow workers and bosses.  Management was ok Needed to comminicate better with there employees.   My coworkers was fun to be around and work with.  Hardest thing about the job was the weather but u deal with it.  My enjoyment of the job was being outside and working with my friends everyday."
good,"Typical work day is pretty busy, training is always in session, the culture of the workplace is growth and forward movement. "
good,Empresa séria em treinamentos e respeito com os seus funcionários e com o meio ambiente.
good,"Foi uma grande experiencia de aprendizado profissional, a GE tem muitas divisões e eu estive na de Oleo e Gas"
good,"Great place to work, awesome atmosphere here in Canton, Ohio.  Very helpful and supportive local managers.  Great benefits."
good,"i read Mechanical Engineering and i have Technical experience that will be a good benefit to yopur country."
good,"Well & Good "
good,My two last reviews had about 5 min of personal feedback and 25 min of plans for the group for the next year.  Management is not in the least bit interested in employees only bottom line.
good,A typical day includes most of the responsibility put on night shift only to get the days job done. The company does not provide any advancement or certifications.
good,It's really annoying being yelled out by 22 year old managers fresh out of college whos last job was a drive thru window operator at dairy queen 6 months ago.
good,"Baker Hughes es una gran Empresa, se aprende muchisimo, el equipo de trabajo excelente."
good,It is a very big company to work at and a lot of different department you can work and get promoted at.
good,"i would like it more if it was in my hometown, gets in the way with work and life balance"
good,"Baker Hughes, a GE company is an organization that sets high goals but doesn't have a plan. Day-to-day is reverse engineering to meet numbers. Give 300% or die trying."
good,Building data books is so time consuming but exciting. You get to learn to much about the company and about what they do. Its exciting to see how all these Oil and Gas Parts come together
good,Things will improve with BJ Services getting out from under the Baker Hughes Management that never understood the business.  Hopefully the new (old management) will return success.
good,Enjoyed fellow employees.  Great pay and benefits.  Lots of time away from family as work/life balance does not exist.
good,"In short, but to the point I need a job in Michigan (west michigan) my wifes mother is in bad health and I need a transfer my location but try to keep a close as i can get to what i make now. Which is over 20.00 a hour. Regardless of everything the move will take place i currently live in Conroe Texas and have been to Muskegon Michigan with my family. We have the funds to move just need a job in order for are relocation to go good. If Indeed could help place me in west Michigan I know there would be great feed back from the company you place me at and that company wouldn't have to think twice about going back to your company for your services, I promise you that. As far as working for Baker Hughes it has its comps, the co-workers are great. The management is terrible and they make dumb and risky chances with are safty even though we have a safty meeting once a week. For some reason are safty issues never get resolved. The hardest part of my job is the 3rd. shift hours. They are currently are teaching me Hard Facing, they are pretty good about letting you learn new skills when they are short handed. I just need help using a scout to help me find jobs in west michigan otherwise I don't think I would be leaving Baker Hughes but, as we all know are family has to come first and mine does so this move is my maditory permanant fix for our famlies wellbeing"
good,"I was told this was a contract to full time position, but it never became full time. I like the job, but pay could be better and is ok for starting out but not for a mid-career person looking to finish out."
good,"Foi um dos melhores momentos profissionais da minha carreira, desenvolvi habilidades e assumi desafios, apenas alguns detalhes quanto à gestão do pessoal mas nada que diminua a grandeza da empresa de maneira geral."
good,The issue that plagues this company at every level is the poor managers it has in place. It seems to reward people based on incompetence instead of their work ethic.
good,Didn't really care for it. Very temporary environment. The training was very poor and the technology at the local work place was very minimal. They were not highly organized locally.
good,A typical day at the warehouse would be. The crew would get there about 7:30. Then we would make sure the shop was clean. We would  transfer chemicals from totes to totes. We would make sure all the trucks were ready and loaded on time. The crew would help other crews get their work done. At about 4:40 the warehouse crew would make sure the shop was clean again. Constantly cleaning and organizing the shop.
good,"The company as a company you could not ask for anything more!!! "
good,it was amazing to see that when employed there that my saving the company $150k per year was noted on my review because the VP of MFG said that managers had to find a flaw in our performance... at least one... it was time to leave... not sure why that was the case but it did not feel right so I had to find another home after many years of being at BHI...
good,"I believe General Electric as a whole, is one of the best to work for in the entire world. The problem seems to be within some of the outlying or new departments such as Oil and Gas."
good,Typical petro company.   Very good while the petrol economy was doing well but very bad once it crashed.    Horrible upper management decisions and personnel.    Peers are great but management is horrid.
good,"Very boring long 12 hour shifts repetitive and awkward times awake on days off, really not good for anyone under the age of 26-30"
good,The best part of my job was having the relationship with the client to be able to work with them from the planning through execution of the project.
good,Good company with great benefits and pay. Job is subject to the market demand. Work/Life balance is not possible given the demands of the job.
good,"•Assistant to the Managing Director along with support to senior executives of the business."
good,I am honored to serve this company as this is the best company in terms of professionalism and work atmosphere. Opinion of each individual matters in this organisation unlike other companies I had worked with.
good,"The company wouldn't be bad to work for with the right people in the right positions. Unfortunately that wasn't the case when I worked there and poor planning, no leadership, and constant mis information played a part in the yards closure"
good,"co-workers are friendly and working as a tight team and they support and take care of each other."
good,"Currently as a contractor, company is very fair to employees and contractors"
good,"Excelent pay, very low on being a people company. Advancment is good but only for BS, Masters or PHD's"
good,"Overall good company for the industry they are in but character flaw: They [BHGE] want the best, most talented, hard working support staff, however they want it at bargin basement rates. Raises are a myth unless its mid/upper managment."
good,"good salary,  good pension,  good benefits."
good,Did not treat employees good.  Did not advance people.  Pay was too low.  The management used intimidation to manage people.  I would work for another division
good,Its a job and no more  You are just a number there and that is all   hard work is not rewarded but lateness and laziness is allowed  If you want to know more then call me and I will let you know personally
good,"I joined in the Pipeline inspection division, almost 4 years ago , the pay was not great , but compensated with   a good Job Work/Life Balance ,unfortunately  the merger with GE  has changed a lot of things  for the worse .  it no longer the same company ."
good,"Good Company to work, but too many distractions (merges, downturns). Poor selection of managers and directors. Company managers are morefocused on personnel goals than what is better for the company."
good,"Delivering is everything, yet fail to consider many safety aspects of products being delivered.  Management without experience or exposure to CE compliance leaves managers non- the wiser to legal requirements of min safety required in industry.  Customers requiring ATEX rated products were sometimes provided with alternatives, not safe to use in allowed areas, without consideration of use.But they did make a lot of money."
good,Good place to learn the pipefitting industry. Overall experience is good. Can't complain work is in doors. Pay rates need to improve though. I would recomend.
good,"Work is straightforward but the click is there, bust your hump with no recognition and do not ask questions of management. Good company and facility but bad on the top end."
good,"I was wanting more out of this company, just didnt have the right  connections. So when it got I got layed off, really liked the traveling with these guys. could've gotten better wages"
good,Everall really enjoyed my time at GE oil and gas had a great bunch of guys I work with towards the end of my four years their management really went downhill and you were more of a number not a envoy work slow down to almost a hawk and was not make enough money to provide for my familyv
good,If you have a technical related job the send you to school and provide excellent training to further your career. They also provide good benefits.
good,"There are multiple locations around the Houston area to commute to, and you may get lucky and have a short drive into work."
good,Working for Baker has given me an opportunity to learn about the drilling side of the oilfield. I've enjoyed working with the people here at the Super Center.
good,"GE Oil & Gas is essentially a collection of somewhat disparate business' acquired over the past 12 years or so. Some are very close/adjacent to the technology and operationally ethos of the traditional GE business - and they are more effective and better integrated."
good,The most rewarding part of my job was that I was able to help in the warehouse.  Working closely with other inside salesman gave me the advantage of learning all the equipment
good,"They gave me my foot in the door in this industry, promoted me up, trained me, and sent me travelling for work, which I love. Unfortunately they shut the tubular division down and we all got laid off or I'd still be with them today."
good,"Baker has a good culture compared to some of the other major oil and gas service firms.  The pay is very good, but the work life balance is not"
good,"GE Oil & Gas purchased Cameron Compression in June 2014.  The company seemed like a good stable company and has many markets, unfortunately, the Oil & Gas Industry is at an all time low and therefore, my position was eliminated due to a reduction in force."
good,"Ever changing High Technology environment. Working under very challenging conditions and varying political context. Encompassing various cultures, improvising to deliver high reliability under less than optimal conditions. Needing to accomplish a very wide range of services such as repair , maintenance, certifications, calibrations, upgrades, testing of various electronics devices. Dealing with import/export rules in countries with challenging rules and restrictions . Upholding the Foreign Corrupt Act practices, in countries less developed . Dealing with local management who will most likely reduce costs recruiting local talent less qualified, but supported by local political interests. Love the travel in many countries, and observing local customs. Love multitasking and the fact that I had to use knowledge in construction,  teaching skills, driving safely in very difficult and varied road conditions."
good,Management is a little left of center and in emergency situations when an employee is injured and needs immediate medical attention that should be the first step getting him to Medical attention not calling the office first
good,I worked all  the time and had no time for life. I did make very good money but had no time to live. I did however love my job and loved what I did there. in all it was a good place to work just had no time to have a life.
good,"Llegaba al trabajo, revisaba correos, llevaba a mi jefe lista de asistencias de capacitacion a nuevos empleados, los compañeros siempre muy amables y atentos, la parte mas dificil es cuando se formaban las carpetas mensuales, se juntaba con trabajo diario, lo que mas me gusto fue la aportacion que realice al hacer lay out de extintores."
good,Great company to work for. good people. friendly work environment. opportunity for growth. great benefits. good place  to retire from. company who cares about their employees and workers.
good,"I think GE is a great place to work. My issue is they keep calling me back to work contract, but they never wanted to bring me on full-time."
good,"Clock in at 7 am"
good,"Good pay, good people, work life balance is minimal, benefits are great, overall good place to work hard if you want family."
good,"While working in the Australian Outback most days began well before sunrise and could finish well after the sun went down. The days were varied as the nature of the work would quickly change depending on activities in The Cooper Basin. I learnt that The Outback is an extremely large area where it is easy to become disorientated if you are not given the right training. Managers at the coalface had an extremely hard job to balance the internal and external requirements but did the best they could under the circumstances. We worked very well as a team to keep our field personnel's equipment in the peak of performance and make sure when there were any issues they were dealt with in a timely manner. The hardest part of the job was being away from my family for extended periods, some long days and the difficulty in getting parts quickly to a remote area. The up side was the camaraderie, resilience and ingenuity among the workforce,"
good,Hughes Christensen is a oil well drill bit research and manufacturing facility. They employ a full size bottom hole simulator to test drill bits. The similator can actually simulate down hole conditions in a variety of formations.
good,Safety is tied into managements bonus program so they completely overkill it to the point it makes your job difficult at times. Upper management changes every two to three years but the supervisors have stayed the same for the last three decades so nothing really changes just what they like to harp on. It goes in cycles every few months it will be quality then production then downtime then it all starts over.
good,"The work itself is really enjoyable. The people you work with really become your second family. My only complaint is the management staff. If you are not part of their ""clique"" then you will NOT succeed in the company. Management will constantly remind you that your position is easily replaceable with a person from a temp agency. Not to mention the constant feeling of being uncomfortable by management, they will literally gather around and watch you work, while loudly critiquing your every movement. This review should not be of Baker Hughes as a company but simply one warehouse, their Frac Point location in Houston, Texas."
good,"Great job, but our management was a shamble no accountability and no coordination among field managers. I always had a great team that I managed on my drilling site. The hardest part of the job was working 350 plus days a year. Having a successful project and seeing different parts of the world."
good,"rebuilt drill bits using sandblas,torch,machines,welding,grinding,painting, cleaning,washing, learned how to cut with a torch and weld, learned to sandblast and grind,my co workers were hard working and fun to work with,management was on point, the hardest part of the job was working in the oven with the bits putting on the teeth we were always gettin our hand burned, what i enjoyed about it was my supervisor had musc set up loud and we would dance sing and laugh while we worked"
good,"Empresa de grande porte, que oferece oportunidade de aprendizado. Trabalhei na área de logística dos produtos químicos que eram produzidos na própria, com isso aprendi muito sobre produtos de risco. A empresa oferece ótimos benefícios, mas os salários estão abaixo do mercado de trabalho, e nestes 03 anos que fui colaboradora, não tive oportunidades de promoção, fato que acabou me desmotivando em seguir carreira na mesma. Ambiente agradável de se trabalhar e ótimo relacionamento com a equipe da qual fazia parte."
good,Baker Hughes is a company the vendors have a great loyalty too.
good,"Going to work everyday is fun to meet with my team members."
good,"Overall, a good place to work. Can come in at any time and close a plant, etc. As the decision is usually made from somewhere else without warning. Subject to oil; price swings."
good,"My time in Baker was good for the most part issue with leadership honesty and integrity. My main Review will be the branch of BJ services that was done after the merger with Allied. Leadership was removed and placed with personal not qualified for the position, making the transition difficult. No training provided for the new personal taking the new management positions and no communication between teams, very dangerous in this type of field."
good,"The crew i worked with was great on every rig. The warehouse on land was iffy, asked for equipment and took months to receive putting us in terrible situations with the client, border line dangerous."
good,"Данная компания была первой иностранной компанией в моей трудовой деятельности, изначально (с 2007 года по 2013 год) была одной из лучших компаний по отношению к сотрудникам, карьерным возможностям и руководству (присутствие иностранных менеджеров), однако вернувшись в компанию  (в 2018 году) в надежде увидеть ту саму компанию, был очень разочарован, кроме имени ничего не осталось, в корне изменился подход к сотрудникам, руководство и качество выполняемой работы, что не позволяет показывать положительные результаты и рост."
good,Not sure how comfortable I am with this company cause all the work positions and jobs are all based on the price of oil. If there is a shortage or spill of oil they tend to do layoffs
good,"I worked in the field, which is a huge difference than what one would find in an office environment. With that being said I have a different take on things. Baker Hughes is an oil field service company and makes most of its profits by supporting client needs in the field. This would leave you to believe that the organization should pay more attention to the field and have a culture of the office supporting the field. However, the culture is more pointed to the ideology that the field is supposed to support the office. It is very clear that the office and corporate side does not have a good grasp on what the field needs and how it works. Direct field managers have little to no authority to make needed changes. The amount of “Red Tape” is oppressive and cumbersome, stalling innovation and preventing efficiency."
good,Baker Hughes is a relaxed place to work with great people. Does not pay as much compared to competitors and benefits have declined in recent years.Little room for advancement for engineers
good,"typical day: worked with very little supervision, worked primarily with the craftsmen and their supervisors on the floor to determine what had been done on the previous days and was ready for inspection. Also worked hand in hand with customers representatives and contractors that were brought in"
good,"Poor life/work balance, but the pay is nice. Gives plenty of opportunity to learn. "
good,"Baker has treated me very well and I love working for them.  Recently we’ve had some challenging times with the down turn and numerous take overs which limited our growth, both personally and company wide.  This has been frustrating since iam very dedicated to them.  I feel like we have been at a stand still for 3 years and there’s not a lot of room for me to progress."
good,Will work 24 plus hours per day. on rig up days will be physically strenuous and on pumping days there will be long wait times without much to do. Basically be ready to work at any given time.
good,met veel plezier jarenlang in de olie en gaswinning gewerkt. Jammer dat het nu op zijn retour lijkt te zijn.
good,"GE is a very diverse workplace and the learning experiences are endless."
good,"Productive and fun work place to work.."
good,"Great salary & benefits, but starting to become less so over the past 18 months.  The support & priority of good project management is hit or miss depending on the department and/or the direct management.  Working from home is not a very wide-spread practice.  Job security has become issue since the drop in oil prices & after the merger with GE."
good,"Life was good before the Halliburton acquisition efforts and the economic downturn. The culture was happy. Then, everybody starting getting laid off and everyone was always scared it would be them next."
good,"Working here was like anywhere else you have your ups and downs, good times and bad, but overall working for Baker was a great learning experience, it teaches you alot about the wireline side of the oil field with lots of experience in the field with the guys you work with."
good,"it was a good company to work for, the company treated us fairly but the department i worked for was shut down so i was made redundant but until this point it was ok"
good,"very demanding and driven to improve. Never settling and always looking at ways to make things better, easier and quiet without compromise of quality or health and safety."
good,"Good place to work, great benefits , lots of challenges,  great pay.  Overall I would advise anyone to work for them. The personal are hard working and share the ins and outs of the work day. Lots of help most of the time. Must deal with many people who may not look at things as you might"
good,"Since I worked through a staffing agency, there were no benefits and definitely no job security. All it took for the manager that didn't like me was to make a phone call and the staffing agency told me to not show up at the job anymore."
good,its a great place to work at. Every one is supportive and understanding. Teamwork is very important to this company you must be able to communicative with everyone and be able to work out any problems you might have.
good,I really like to fast pace work and I hope to get back into oil and gas. A company where you are able to move up the ladder. Hard work with this company will be able to get you moved up.
good,Very demanding job. many responsibilities and many hours of down time and time on job. Chain of management was sometimes difficult to follow many changes at last minute. Learning to deal with severe weather changes and driving conditions. Also dealing with co workers could be very frustrating at certain times during operations. But still interesting place to work all ways learning new safety procedures and skills related to job tasks.Overall environment was lots of adjusting to weather conditions and equipment failure issues. Safety was the main concern and keeping a safe working environment was key to overall success of each job worked.
good,"Proffessional"
good,"It was really nice joining BHI the work here is really challenging and it requires brain using in each step of work, in the same time the team work culture is very helpful , you just feel that every body around you want to help or motivate you to do the required job"
good,"Una excelente empresa, que valora las normas de seguridad establecidas, con colegas de trabajo preocupados por cumplir las normas de trabajo y con ganas de enseñarte y manifestarte sus experiencias. Lo que más me gusto fué el compromiso de mis colegas por enseñar su conocimientos."
good,Hoje estou a procura de uma nova oportunidade pois tive que ser transferido e tenho planos na cidade de onde fui transferido.
good,"Overall I was happy working at Baker. I was able to advance very quickly and wages were high. Technology is state-of-the-art and there are many opportunities with Baker. They live by their core values."
good,aside the poor communication it was a good place to work .you have room to learn and grow.hardest part of the job is being away from home for long hours .
good,"The work was ok,but the layoffs was to much. The pay was above  standards and the benefits was pretty good. I dont think this company is promising."
good,Loved working with my crew and the coil tubing units.  But I have issues with how they laid off and discared their experianced staff.
good,"Much of the management were too concentrated on their own job security to perfom their jobs properly. Some blamed it on managerial pressures but it was evident that they were not suited for the job positions they held. Much incompetence."
good,"With impending acquisition of Halliburton, too many quality senior managers have been packaged out.  Sever lack of experience in current Canadian management group.  Employees no longer matter and current management does not know how to motivate employees, especially in tough market conditions.  Hopefully, Halliburton can save this sinking ship."
good,"Went from Rig to Rig and ran down hole equipment. met a lot of people in the Gulf Of Mexico. This job had a lot of opportunity to advance, by cross training with different tools. The pay was top notch but you were never home to enjoy it."
good,"After many years if being trained in all aspects of my division and possessing experience unmatched by anyone in my division, advancement was quickly overlooked. Experience is trumped over who you suck up to."
good,Decent company will hold you back depending on management. Long Hours and they will work you like a dog. You will make alot but at the cost of your familes time. I have seen a ton of divorce over the years because of the time away from your family
good,A normal day was to expect to work all day and night.I learn how to ripped down mud motors and core barrels.Hardest thing was never home. The easiest was that I had some good friends there.
good,You are gone a lot and work long hours. The pay is good but it is hard to be away. Typical day involves creating and sending reports to customers.
good,Baker Hughes was a good challenging job that tests your ability. I learned about how oil field tools run and how much goes into them.
good,Great company while it lasted. It's the end of an era. Great benefits. Great pay. Good reputation. But it is soon to be gone. Enter Halliburton.
good,"Baker Hughes has a rich history of Innovation and providing solutions to difficult problems in the Oil and Gas Industry. Unfortunately after 100 years the company is being acquired by Halliburton. The Baker Hughes name will cease to exist. Its divisions, products and people will be stripped away and sold off to other companies. Whats left will be absorbed by Halliburton."
good,"Acquired by GE within the last few years, gaps in system abilities and processes can make the site a tough place to work. There's been a lot of focus on the site and good people have been added, but resources are stretched so workloads are high. It's a great place to learn, but you have to be ready to sacrifice some work/life balance to get everything done. That being said, the employees get along very well together, sharing information and creating a very friendly environment."
good,The hours were horrible but in all it was a good place to work.
good,"Duties as stated in resume.  I have certainly learned a lot over my work life with this firm and am grateful for that.  While I enjoyed the work and my co-workers, most of us felt that we were over loaded with the demands of timelines and constraints."
good,"Good company to learn something new. Good work and life balance. Good pay. However, less technical support from management."
good,"There's so much change that seems to be waffling between who they once were to what they think they want to be. "
good,Very physical job with lots of overtime. May not be a good gob for anybody who likes their wife and kids.
good,"•	Lead and have supervisory responsibility for the Hiring and Onboarding shared services team for Eastern Hemisphere"
good,"Baker is a very good company.  You'll get back what you put in.  Work hard, move when necessary, etc. and you stand a very good chance of having a satisfying, successful career with a top-notch company."
good,"Good place, Progression is ok, but requires specific profiles. "
good,"I am an instrumentation engineer ,with experience of almost 3 years. Presently working for GE oil & gas on contract basis. Looking for good carrier opportunity in the field of projects and engineering."
good,"A empresa tende a super explorar o funcionário, os treinamentos são bons e feitos no seu tempo de folga com oportunidade de treinamento fora do país. Porém o salário não é dos melhores, fica muito a desejar em relação as outras empresas."
good,"Een zeer professioneel bedrijf, waar aandacht is voor de mens."
good,very stressful job with long hours but you make a whole lot of money.
good,"Worked a 14/14 schedule, pay was mid ranged, housing was good, could work long hours, up to 40 hours straight, time off was always a plus, benefits were average"
good,"- Ambiente organizacional adequado."
good,"Boa empresa, pouca possibilidade de crescimento, mas no geral Boa de se trabalhar"
good,I would like to work again in this company as I been trained to dubai for the mixing and pumping cement by the seawaok pressure pump.woul like to get more experiency on calculation like squeez job caculation.
good,Overall it is a nice work environment as colleagues are nice and helpful. Company is a bit understaffed hence not easy to get real support when you need some help.
good,It's normally easy to make a positive contribution. Most functions require input from other functions in order to perform their role. Many colleagues are very experienced and are happy to facilitate.
good,"Excelente  empresa, da oportunidades de  crescimento para quem é  interessado. Muita preocupação com a segurança,  na saúde e ambiental."
good,"This place had everything a machinist wanted and provided the necessary tools to complete job orders but Management sucked and they always hired from outside, people who had NO knowledge of machining where in charge and caused a lot of problems and constant stupid changes to departments/ cells. got old real quick"
good,"I definitely woould recommend a friend to work for Baker Hughes. I was in leadership and i Truly enjoyed my time there!! Blender Operations was the most interesting and yet challenging part of Baker Hughes.  The training department was a little behind on procedures, however still learned a great deal!!"
good,"typical day would be to service customer needs in regards to chemical performance and optimization, complete internal reports and forecasting/ordering stock. "
good,"One of the few best places left to work in the oil and gas industry, a great place to work its some times testing and fun working with great individuals talented and result driven"
good,"Definitely a place to teach and learn every aspects for the job, Alot of on the job training. Stressful at times but always educational. Employees were very helpful and made you feel right at home"
good,"a great place to work.I got to travel all over the US. Meet people"
good,"Empresa com ótimo ambiente, onde todos estão dispostos a ajudar."
good,"The legacy GE Oil & Gas business has great quality, and risk management and offers a respectable benefits package. The addition of Baker Hughes (upstream services) to the portfolio brings GE closer to their core customers."
good,"Although travel was often necessary to larger offices for meetings and courses, the benefits and work schedule were generally positive.  There were also many resources to improve ones career and output - whether that was in the office or in the field."
good,The company is quite good and flexible which they let their employees complete their tasks at home. Working there helps me to communicate confidently.
good,Wonderful work environment if you are familiar and enjoy a manufacturing envirnoment.  The most difficult part of the job is the system is outdated so it makes processing cumbersome.
good,Management is good. Transparent workplace with good exposure. Has good career prospects for engineers with field experience and a good chance for relocation abroad.
good,"GE was a great carrier opportunity. Gained a lot of knowledge from the accounting roles. Had great mentors who helped guide me with my role at GE, Inc"
good,good company good team and well organised. company left town due to relocation and moved operations north. not bad place to start career in oil and gas service industry
good,"Normal day involved driving a truck, and lifting heavy equipment. Worked alot of hours and was gone from home alot but did pay very well. Being on call was tough but I was able to get a full week off after being on call for 2 weeks."
good,Working for BHGE is like becoming part of a family. Everyone is friendly and a relaxed working environment. That being said they work you hard. There is always work to be done and they expect it to be done whatever it takes.
good,"Good benefits, "
good,Baker Hughes was a good company to work for. They strive to make you the best that you can be. They provide opportunities  for you to excel in the corporation.
good,"Baker Hughes is one of the leading integrated oilfield services company with its advanced and state of the art technology being its most unique advantage over its peers. It is one of the leading companies to have performed extraordinarily in maintaining high standards of health, safety, and environment. Its learning and teamwork oriented culture provides a myriad of opportunities to learn and improve your understanding about the energy industry. Failure is not punished, rather learning is encouraged."
good,"typical days, can be hectic. plant is closing due to lack of work. Contractors and vendors seem to run the majority of our site currently. Management has had several major changes."
good,Empresa boa de se trabalhar com boas oportunidades profissionais em várias partes do mundo
good,"Little time at home, lots of hours on the job.  Mostly good people to work with in the field.  Little notice to be on site.  Little social life.  Long days, but typically easy work."
good,"Designs the first mono-bore completions in the Maracaibo Lake. This type of completion reduces the cost of well interventions because of the big size tubing and full access to the perforations with having to move a rig to location. Designed the first triple completion in Venezuela. Designed the HP/HT sour service (CO2/H2S) completion"
good,Baker Hughes will provide you with challenges if you are willing to take them on. Great place for career advancement and the job security has been great if you are willing to perform. Great place to work if you are self motivated.
good,not a bad place to work. But they do lay a lot of head games. Examples are dangling a raise or promotion in front of you that rarely meets fruition.  Not difficult to work for as long as you do your work
good,"Pay is good, a lot of work when the times are good; so a lot of over time. When times are bad they have lots of layoffs and the people that stay only work 40 hours a week."
good,"repaired tools, delivered tools, picked up used tools, would have stayed but company terminated position, enjoyable place to work, provided housing or paid for houseing"
good,No career advancement and no compensation for increasing job responsibilities. Lead men did not know what they were doing for the most part and taking credit for work workers would do as their own.
good,"very structural place to work, this place had a lot room for grow, but in some areas was very specialize skill set, the various projects that i work had an excellent pmo and was a lot of structuring going on into the projects, some was overseas projects."
good,"Large company.  If you catch oil on the upswing you will get incredible training and the ability to be part of something that is second in technicality to NASA or the military.    If you want to move up, you have to be aggressive.  I saw lots of good people get destroyed by the ego's of management.  The job is the job, its not a lifestyle, change happens fast, horrible decisions are occasionally made.  Its a place for the person trying to get somewhere from ages 22-35."
good,"Pays well in a cyclical industry.  Great benefits, but a lot of days away from home.  Fast paced, must learn quickly and on your own most of the time."
good,"- A typical day at work involves answering phone calls, responding to emails, helping with issues in the shop, etc.."
good,"Nice hands on training options , lot of different skills you can learn as diversify company , I worked in PPS - pressure pumping department so get a chance to learn a lot , indulging subsea testing  to N2 pumping"
good,"good job.  political at times.  Changed bosses frequently, and this was a little difficult to adapt to.  Might be because we were an acquisition, and ge had to have control."
good,Entire team works together to accomplish each goal for the day individually. You can count on your fellow co-workers to help with just about anything you need in the workplace.
good,"A typical day involves 3 or more meetings with suppliers, or business stakeholders regarding current projects in process or being considered. "
good,"trabajo bajo presion diaria"
good,"Lost focus as the down hit. unable to understand what it took to secure work. short sighted vision! Changed Managers and with that moral was down , no direction , not winning tenders and loss of manpower. Perhaps not the Manager to lead at that point in time ?"
good,"Hired on as an offshore drilling rotation field engineer. Rotation not followed, communicated, or explained. Lack of support/guidance from management. Emails to management with concerns deliberately ignored. Devoted several years of hard work with no acknowledgements or appreciations for personnel sacrifices. That's only the experience within my drilling services departments. If opportunity to transfer departments became available I would not be exploring other opportunities outside of the company."
good,Baker Hughes is a great company that employs some of the smartest people in the industry. Nice collaborative environment with everyone willing to go the extra mile.
good,"Baker Hughes was one of the best companies in the oilfield service industry to work prior to industry downturn and subsequent acquisition activity.  Even today the news is hinting that they may be divested, which means more turn over and more new faces as your boss."
good,My time with Baker Hughes was a very good learning experience for me.  I was provided the opportunity to advance in my role and Leadership was exceptional
good,"Working on a research team in Egypt wasn't as expected; however, I believe working in a research team in BAker Hughes abroad will be much more useful."
good,"Worked closely with the Creative Director, Product Marketing, and Internal Customers to design and produce corporate brochures, trade show graphics, banner stands, powerpoint presentations, product sheets, white papers, direct mailers, magazine ads, client event invitations, sales promotions, postcards, logo designs, web banners/graphics, evites, iBooks, and other collateral items that adhere to the existing Brand Identity of the company"
good,"Company has great benefits and opportunities across the US. The issues with Oil & Gas is that there are people outside of the industry making decisions for the business direction, which negatively impact day to day functions."
good,"Enjoyed working for GE Oil & Gas. Great team work but could use restructure. Benefits were great, however I will say to always get your salary in writing."
good,"Typical day at work was overseeing completions operations on location. Learned about completions design. Management was good at encouraging progress. The workplace culture was positive and everyone was there for the same reason. The hardest part of the job was the hours and lack of time off when working. Also, living conditions available for the area were a downside. The most enjoyable part of the job was the time off every few weeks for rotation."
good,As the company has aged it has become overly Bureaucratic. There have been too many mergers and/or Acquisitions which has led to increased volatility within the company.
good,Management was very good. Great compensation and benefits. Workplace environment was very laid back and professional. Overall it is a great company to work for.
good,"I enjoyed working here with complex engineered products and a wide variety of people.  I learned about the oil business and NX8.5.  The culture was professional and relaxed.  The management was stuck in the past, unable or unwilling to bring their manufacturing processes up to date.  A lot of money left on the table."
good,Baker Hughes like every other company that manufactures parts for the oil industry has been struggling. The only way to survive is to get lean and mean and that is what happened at Baker.
good,well in baker is very good multi culture company every day i have new lesson on daily job  team is always encourage by team leaders and managers one of the best thing in baker hughes is open door polices and safety and quality culture i learn so many lesson thru this culture

good,A melhor empresa que trabalhei até hoje. Com uma gerência comprometida e humana.
good,"It has been in a bit of flux lately which the down market resulting in massive management changes and layoffs. People act differently when they are constantly scared of losing their job. Great way to make a sizable income, but stability is never guaranteed."
good,I went into the oilfield and did not know anything about it. This company devoted their time and money to train me and provided me with the proper tools to succeed.
good,Signed up knowing that hours would be long. Did not sign up not knowing when or if I would be able to have some time off without having to take vacation.
good,"i think the summary says it all."

good,"Empresa de grande porte no setor de prestação de serviços para o setor de óleo e gás. Focada na perfeita formação dos seus funcionários, dando muita importância para o suporte técnico e científico."
good,"Overall I think BHI is a great company. They treat their employees very well with competitive salaries and great benefits. Some product lines are far better than others, however, and technology can lag behind. This causes jobs to be lost and employees to be cut. They should look deeper into management and sales teams to make sure that they are keeping up their end of the bargain. It was a great experience to work there to be brief."
good,Baker Hughes is a good employer for an engineer coming out of school.  The fast paced environment and work load allows you to assume responsibility quickly and gain real world experience.  Training acquired through the company is a great asset to someone starting out in the oil and gas industry.
good,"At Baker Hughes I quickly learned how to work together with customers with given well data to create an ideal system that would work best for the customer.  Engineers work closely with Sales to get the proper equipment sized and installed as efficiently as possible.  Engineering also works with the shop troubleshooting issues with parts and equipment.  Every part of the office works together to get quality equipment in the ground for customers as efficiently as possible.  The work environment could be stressful at times, but very rewarding."

good,Its the type of company that you wouldn't expect to care for its employee's but they do.  Leaving corporate America for the oil field was the best thing I ever did for myself.  The company was great...

good,Good company and good place to work. Challenges with the oil and gas industry but always challenging to be efficient. Everyday you learn something new
good,"My four years working with Baker was very positive for me. The people were great to work with and I made many friends during this time. Unfortunately the stress placed on Baker with the Halliburton merger and the drop in fuel demand, the company had to make tough decisions to survive the current market down turn. Unfortunately I was one of the effected employees to be included in the reduction of force. Companies have to do what's necessary to survive. Moving forward, I hope that a new opportunity awaits me in the near future."

good,I cannot give a good review as I don't work for this company any more as I was let go because of the price of oil but I liked the work and the guys I worked with were great
good,lack of family life because of the travel back and forth. Good pay just wish it was close to home than maybe a perfect job. Quality of life and health was not good because of the position.
good,Would have been an excellent place to continue working but decided to move the plant to TX.  I actually had a History Teacher as a Supplier Quality Engineer so the actual degree meant nothing to GE>

good,"GE Oil & Gas is a good company. There are lot of things to learn provided we are in the right position. Since we moved from Cameron to GE as part of acquisition, it seems moving up the ladders seems difficult.  I am looking for a career change to learn new things."

good,"I worked for Baker Hughes for 13 years in everything from Field Operations to Operations management to Business Development and Global Product Line management. Like most any company, the experience and satisfaction with any position was always directly correlated to the leadership and wisdom of my direct manager. Some were the best I have ever worked with while others were lacking in clarity and direction."

good,a safe and secured work environment. balance work and harmonious team in the company give me a new motivation to increase my work output.
good,While working for Baker Hughes there was a strong emphasis placed on continued education. This was accomplished through attendance in class room settings where an instructor with first hand knowledge of the material would teach the subject to employees.
good,Overall while working for GE OIL has given me true growth opportunity bad allowed me to improve upon my leadership skills
good,"12 hour shifts."
good,"A typical day at work was dealing with day to day issues on trouble jobs, I gained a great deal of experience through these types of trouble jobs. Learning how to deal with customers needs as well as other employees. The best part of the job was earning the trust among the employees and being able to help each other out."
good,"pay is good and hours are good, only problem is the oil fluctuation and a couple of management decisions that are not always in the best interest of the employees"
good,"Já trabalho a 8 anos nesta empresa, onde inicialmente se chamava Wellstream e depois foi comprada pela GE Oil & Gás. Tenho muito agradecer a está empresa por todo o investimento feito em mim me tornando um analista fiscal. Excelemte relacionamento com os meus colegas de trabalho e reconhecimento dos trabalhos executados. Hoje procuro novos desafios dentro da área fiscal ou financeiro."
good,The company is a good company if you fit the culture and part of the value process. Experience is valued within divisions.
good,"I loved the job and the people, but upper management was in an extreme hurry to lay off everyone.  I was an engineer with excellent marks and they refused to transfer me elsewhere.  To them, you're merely a pawn in a chess game."
good,"Decent company with a very challenging schedule. On call 24 hours and sometimes, undesirable weather conditions. Good money when the rig count is high but very hard to make a living during slow periods."
good,"Very flexible hours (people start/finish at a wide range of times) and it's generally a nice place to work - the management and staff are mostly  pretty ""laid back""."
good,"Their internship program was very well put together. I learned more during the summer than I had learned the previous year in school. Sadly, the program has been cancelled this year amid massive layoffs."
good,Working in the oil and gas industry has helped me gain more experience within working in a busy office and where working to strict deadlines is an everyday task.
good,"Baker Hughes is a great company to work for and offers many opportunities for growth. Due to the current oil market and Halliburton/BHI merger, there is no longer job security."
good,Great work environment with the people around me. I enjoyed that every day was different it was never the same.We were a team at every rig site it was never about individual.
good,"BHI is definitely a good company to get your foot in the door to the oil and gas industry. However, be prepared to have a very rocky work/life balance. Management rarely speaks to those in the field and there are issues of management having no clue what is going on with their own people. Their management style is ""the right hand typically doesn't know what the left hand is doing"" type of thing. People tend to be put in leadership positions that have little to no experience and on the job training is minimal. Pay and incentives are being cut in my district at the moment and with the uncertainty from the Haliburton take over to the price of oil, things are beginning to get tense. However, when things are good, you are busy all the time if you are in the field. A rotation is not offered unless your managers are flexible and allow you to be dedicated to a rig with two other people. The vacation policy is ""use it or lose it"" with only two weeks a year making time off rare and precious. The hardest part of this job is definitely the work/life balance. From my experience and what I've seen, it's very difficult on marriages and family especially if you're used to a rotation schedule. The most enjoyable part can be the coworkers. It's a team effort and those in the field seem to know it. We're all in this together and going through it together so there is a mutual understanding. The atmosphere ends up being like a family."
good,"You will learn a lot about what it really means to be an engineer in the world world here at Baker Hughes. The company has great benefits, vacation policy, and working atmosphere."

good,Nice workplace to work with. We worked as a team and had fun while working
good,"Great company to work for - very multicultural. Employees from all over, collectively working together to achieve common goals."
good,"Lead crew to the site to cement casing in the ground for gas well productions. Supervised the crew in the rig in/out operation and lead them during the cement jobs. Supervised and guided crews on equipment issues that arose and maintained equipment. Learned a lot, because every job was different and met with a lot of different people to ensure the job was done correctly and safely."
good,"Baker is a great place to work, and the pay and benefits are good. There are a few things I would change, but every workplace will have things that your personal preferences would like to change. The Halliburton aquisition causes some unrest, which may cause some workers to look for other employment."
good,Surrounded with great people that were willing to teach others about the company and equipment. Entire team was supportive and helpful. Wonderful equipment.

good,team work was great lots of friendly people to work with and a very family oriented place to work.

good,"While the pay does not compare to other oil & gas companies in the Houston area, the culture is diverse.  There is a focus on great management."
good,Baker Hughes was a great place to work.  The people are interesting and Baker Hughes looks after them
good,"Everyday was a learning experience for me at Baker Hughes.  Managing a team of 7 throughout Alberta and Ontario had it's challenges. The logistics did not allow me to have a hands on experience with each of them.  I built the team up so they became self sufficient yet knew I was only an email or phone call away to address any problems, concerns and provide training and assistance when needed. I held a weekly conference call with all of them to just ""talk"".  I felt this was a good way for us to learn together and offer suggestions and support, not just by me, but by all of us.  Having the administrative team report to me allowed us to unify the way we preformed the daily duties requested of administrators.  Any one of us were able to cover sick days and vacation time at the other bases without any disruption to the business.  My co-managers coached me on becoming a strong team leader. I had a lot of respect for them.  I was able to take what they taught me and apply it to my team gaining the respect and support from them just as I had for the management that taught me.  My experience at Baker Hughes was invaluable and grew me in to a confident team leader and player."

good,"I loved working at Baker Hughes in Perryton. If afforded and opportunity to work and learn all aspects of the Frac/Stimulation and the cementing side of the oil industry. However due to the was Baker Hughes has messed up the internal operation of the BJ Services side and policies the implemented (i.e. 2 years a current position/location before transfer or promote) as well as their ""standardized"" promotion program through Achieve, it became a nightmare to continue to work there with the prospect of advancement. Also a lack of pay raises (but the 100s of VP and CEO received their bonuses), cuts in per diem and inadequate reimbursement for travel also contributed to my leaving BHI."

good,"Introduced me to a very diverse and truly intellectually equal work environment, where feeling as indifferent due to my various views and opinions or ideas.  I now feel as though I am not only among peers, but also among so very many mentors to contribute to my constant desire to learn at least (1) new thing daily."
good,I have learned a lot since I have been here but the management system in place has become worse and worse.
good,"a typical day at work is fully packed with one 1hour break."
good,"Excellent equipment to work with, however advancement is very limited. I have had great success with learning at this company, and management is friendly and easy to talk to. "
good,"The typical workday was filled with administrative tasks such as answering the phone, mailings, and paperwork. Management was great at this job and really made the place desirable to work at.  "
good,"The environment is very stressful and the work life balance is always at risk."
good,local people are great management is new overall a good place to work. just not busy right now in my location.
good,"I did not work there for very long but I did learn a lot about the fracturing process, shale gases and hazards of doing such. The people I had the pleasure to work with were quite nice and fun to meet/work with. The job required some heavy lifting and endurance."
good,"Great company to work for. Area HSE guy a micro-manager,. He made job more stressful that what it is........"
good,Baker Hughes is a great company to work for just dont like the cold and the district i am working out of.
good,O ambiente de trabalho encontrado na empresa é agradável assim como podemos destacar também o comprometimento da gerencia com a empresa e seus colaboradores.
good,"Baker Hughes was a good place to work, however management and supervisors only came around if you screwed something up. Little to no direction/orders given by supervisor(s)."
good,"Le giornate di lavoro non sono mai le stesse spesso per la tipologia di lavoro che svolgo, questo per me è stato un nuovo lavoro, e tuttora sono ancora in fase di apprendimento, è la atipica occupazione che la si conosce mai fino in fondo ci sono sempre dei risvolti che bisogna affrontare, l'azienda è una multinazionale a gestione tipica piramidale , divisa per reparti e tipologie di lavoro con superiori subalterni e paritari di servizio, ci sono delle situazioni che ritengo impegnative e che mettono alla prova la resistenza fisica e mentale, ma a volte capitano periodi di assoluta tranquillità e benessere. Tuttosommato è difficile descriverlo, bisogna provarloe viverlo per rendersi conto di cosa possa essere la vita nell'oilfield."
good,I would Drive a tractor and trailer haul bulk cement to rig locations rig up and perform pressure pumping
good,"Great Company To work For,Lots Of Benefits Room For Advancement"
good,running capillary/coil tubing units
good,"Baker is a nice company the salary is good, but the main draw back is the big lack of organization and rules. There are no rules for getting promoted quite often good professionals get stuck and quite often stupid one advance in the career, you have no life usually works 12hs/day sometimes 7 days a week and sometimes you lose your holidays in the work, but the money is good, specially in operations."
good,12 to 14 hours a day. learned a lot of what probloms there is in oil and gas production.
good,A typical day is filled with learning new ways to extract data and analysis via excel
good,Good work place with multiple opportunities for career development

good,"There was always room to grow at Baker Hughes, if you wanted to learn there was always someone who was willing to to show you the proper way to do anything"
good,"It’s oil work so it’s very prone to the peaks and valleys of the economy.  All in all it’s a great company, but no job security due to the previously mentioned issue."
good,"the work and safety culture in this job is the best i have seen, but this job is extremely demanding and the biggest issue i have experienced is with management of associates and liability of tasks and assignments being handled lightly."
good,Not good not bad but it’s ok. Decent paycheck but the out of town work kinda sucks for home life.  You get a minimum of 40 a week so you at least know you will have some money coming in.
good,"Great opportunity to work with Baker Hughes EHO Ltd,Dubai team. I am handling DC export shipments. Nice team, good management, I am happy to work with BHGE."
good,"The group has great professionals from the executive level right down to the floor and the work culture is good."
good,Great job it is what you make of it and you have to put your self in a position to where they need you  just like any job in this country. If you are not need and it comes a time when cuts need to be made you are gone . YOU have to trust in your ability to work not on management.  Because they have to look out for what's best for the company not you. So it's all about work not about suck ups.
good,Co-workers are amazing people.  Everyone authentically cares for each other.
good,OK place to work. Was on night shift. Six in the afternoon till 6 o’clock in the morning. They run everything by seniority would’ve taken me a long time to get to dayshift.
good,"This was not a typical job. I drilled oil & gas wells. 2 Weeks on the job site - 2 week at home."
good,"In an overall company is was an excellent experience working for Baker Hughes, except for the fact that it was only a contract work.It was also a very working learning experience"
good,Managers were great. Same cannot be said for lead administrator. Was a miserable human being that created an extremely hostile work environment. Was disappointed when let go.
good,"Looking to get into the oilfield? Cementation with baker hughes is as good a place to start as any. Money is good, but you have to work at it. On call job. Always remember, live on 40 hours a week money, and always put your family first. Otherwise, you will fail."
good,"Pay is good"
good,"**My review is strictly based on one location and may not be an accurate representation of other facilities.**"
good,hours where  long but the pay and benefits where great. the first manager was horrible the only way the project got finished was by replacing them. that is also why the plant closed.
good,"Ge was a good company to work for, but sometimes the bigger you are the slower it  takes to react to customers requirements."
good,"Massive company so every experience will be much different. Lots of resources to support you. SME's are just a phone call away. Management team has reacted to the great crew change by shifting decision making up and driving outcomes through rules and metrics. Makes middle management a paper pushing, checkbox completion exercise and often results in perverse incentives where an employees accountable for performing in a way that is contrary to the company's best interests."
good,Fine place. Management may be somewhat oblivious to what really goes on among employees when it comes to personalities. If you can navigate around them it's a fine pace.
good,He is a great company to work for if your into the political portion of the corporate life. Very hard to be recognized for the work you perform and compensation
good,"Its A good company to work for, I learned a lot about oil drilling process, learned to drive lass A Trucks. Got to buy A house and never had no money, winter north of WO just isn't for me. Would do it again besides winter."
good,"Started in 2012 at what was previously a BJ Services base. Worked was varied and exciting, then the threat of selling our division, our company, etc became the norm and it greatly impacted all aspects of the job. 2015 to 2018 were awful years at the company."
good,"GE Oil & Gas had great people to work with. The work environment is fun, and everyone is friendly. However, processes move by inertia, bogging down innovation."
good,"One of the better paying companies in the industry.  The environment can be very political at times, def one of these ""who you know"" not ""what you know"" places.  Very difficult to balance work and life, but I was in field ops, so my situation is a little different"
good,"I have no comments on how they can improve management and staff. "
good,Empresa seria não atrasa salarios e tem otimos beneficios mas peca na parte operacional por não valorizar os verdadeiros colaboradores que se dedicam em favor da empresa.
good,The majority of the managers are cool and not bad at all. There are the few that you do not want to work for. Biggest problem is the company will not fire someone that is a horrible employee. As long as you show up on time and hit that time clock you pretty much have a job. Its an 80-20 place for sure. 20% of the employees do 80% of the work. There are ways to move up and make more money but the pay is low for hourly and high for salary.
good,productive work environment with good benefits overall it  was a good place to work and learn new things the worse case was the mass laid off  we had due to company relocating.
good,It was a great job only down fall is that you are never home and if you are family man that is not the job for you. If you  are single and looking for
good,"A good place to work, but provide no opportunity to advance in learning. Repetitive and easy work. Management is decent, and very friendly people to work with."
good,"Co-workers were great, pay was great, oil & gas industry very unstable at times.  Very stressful work environment, past times.  Lots of learning opportunities and advancement.  Mostly men in upper management."
good,"This is a great place to start, but the bureaucracy of being a big company can get in the way of making it a great place to stay as it is sometimes hare to get work done."
good,"it was a great job i loved staying on location for days at a time and loved the hard work and long hours , and moving form location to location to finish the job"
good,"I worked 12 hour shifts, mostly unsupervised.  I learned to work petrel and monitor well logs.  Management was mostly invisible. the culture was relaxed.  the hardest part was working late nights alone.  the most enjoyable part was the time spent learning."
good,most of the time did not know when or where was your next job site.a lot of hours but little labor. no life on call 24/7 even on holidays. a lot of things to learn
good,I learned about the oil business and NX CAM.  The culture was professional and relaxed.  My manager encouraged my questions and was supportive.  The hardest part of working here was watching the inattention to manufacturing details.  A major shortage of manufacturing engineers contributed.
good,"Baker Hughes Inc provided me a lot of oportunities to upgrade myself. The Company spent time and money to send their employees to various trainings on both technical stuffs and soft skills such as negiotiation, interculture, presentation, selling skills, ect. It's a multiculture company gathering people from all around the world. The culture there is not very hierachy. Individuals are encourage to speak up and recommend solutions as well as taking their own responsibilities for their tasks. Bosses encourage their employees to grow and upgrade. I had my good time and experiences there before having my career break with my first baby."
good,I merely went through training and didn't start actually working at my station because the oil prices dropped dramatically and they decided they didn't need all the workers that they hired to fill the positions.
good,"This was a good company to work for, but they shut the location I was working at down. I would recommend this job to other people but would let them know that it is a hard job and they pay you well for what you do."
good,"Unless you like to travel a lot this is company with made you travel from north to south and east to west."
good,"Realizar inventarios de las distintas cabezas y combinaciones para cementar, así como también de los distintos accesorios, realizar mantenimiento general a todos los equipos que llegaran de a bordo. Embarcar con antelación los materiales y equipos que van hacer utilizados en un trabajo en particular. proveer al personal de todo lo necesario para la correcta ejecución de los trabajos a realizar a bordo. Dar mantenimiento a los silos de cemento, arina cilica y arena cilica de la planta, mantener en condiciones de operación la planta de cemento."
good,"GE was a great place to work. I really enjoyed the team environment and the layout of the office. "
good,Por la posición de trabajo era una actividad muy a gusto ya que conocía muchas personas ya posición permitía ayudar y colaborar en diferentes áreas de trabajo
good,Baker hughes was a great place to work. Work based on oil and gas industry has its highs and lows so layoffs are expected.  Decent starting pay. Limited advancement where i worked. Overall good place to work.
good,Typical day at work is very hot. I've learned how to assemble and test pressure relief valves. Management is very decent. Workplace culture is amazing. Hardest part of the job is the long days. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I'm saving someone's life.
good,"Great working culture based upon easily attainable core values and an emphasis on safety.  Unfortunately, management is not in touch with employees as they claim.  Even rare talent is consistently sacrificed in the name of cost cutting agendas.  Work and production is demonstrated regularly as a priority over family.  Training opportunities are not often offered due to costs.  When the oil industry is on an upturn things are faantastic.  When there is a decline in production worldwide... either pray or take the initiative to look for another job."
good,"Typical large corporate environment, your experience here will all depend on which group/manager(s) you belong to. I had experiences on both ends of the spectrum, where I had managers that genuinely cared about their employees and their work/life balance, as well as their career paths. I also had managers that strictly thought in terms of profits with no regard to how their employees were treated. The culture overall is positive, some better training to managers would be a benefit to keeping skilled employees."
good,"Big company, good work when it there but a lot of people don't have any respect for people from a different country. I work very hard to get my next promotion but I was always talk down by my supervisor witch maid it not easy."
good,"The work load is not bad and you have good benefits. "
good,"As I was in the same role for so long I was not challenged enough. "
good,"Lot of career opportunities. Be prepare to work long hours. Good compensation and benefits. Multiple locations in the Houston area, so chances are you will change offices (nothing bad with this). Very talented employees and leaders."
good,"Great people, products, benefits. Company not focused on customer and market. Slow moving to make changes or business decisions. Top heavy in upper management."
good,"Some chances for advancement if you demonstrate the right attitude to your work. Most of the personal are willing to train new personal, whilst there is still the stigmata that if they show you too much you will take there job."
good,Promotes personal career growth. Baker Hughes gives great knowledge and understanding of the oil industry with great training. Keeps employees in the loop with information that needs to be needed.
good,"Running mud checks and conditioning mud. Always adhering to safety."
good,Fast paced environment yet provide flexibility in work deliveries. Very resourceful and people oriented organisation. Job rotation between industries are available and people are friendly and helpful.
good,"GE has great benefits and they pay well too.  When things are good, they are good.  When it's slow, watch out.  It's a great company to work for but business is business.  I'd recommend this company. Room for advancement too."
good,"What a rush, hard work but all worth it in the end. That's if your strong enough to make it through successfully. This job can really test a mans perspective on not only work ethic view but life!"
good,Internationally reputed multinational Oil & gas service company. Equal opportunity for all  in this company. Excellent R&D and employee training programs.
good,"Really enjoyed working for G.E. Oil and Gas but the job security after G.E. bought Cameron was horrible.  There were several lay-offs and the morale was horrible as everyone really enjoyed working there, but never knew when they would be layed off."
good,Good company with overall corporate support but the mix of business unit ideas and strategies tend to silo their efforts rather than align resulting in maverick approach to simple business ideas that don't follow any specific best-in-class performance measures.
good,There has been a shift of focus over the past couple of years which was to be expected with the downturn of the oil and gas sector - problem now is Baker Hughes is probably on the back foot for when the turnaround occurs and will be left scrambling for qualified personnel in order to meet the customers demands.
good,Great employer with flexibility and a workplace that fosters growth.  All co-workers and peers were very friendly and helped one another grow.  The hardest part off the job was the long time periods away from home. The most enjoyable part was the flexibility and ability to expand as I saw fit.
good,"2 Client meetings, operations follow up P&L work. Products forecasting, consumption estimation. supervising 6 drilling rigs. and 4 work-over rigs."
good,Had a good experience. Got caught up in the recession. Learned about drill bits and how the oilfield works. Made many friends along the way. Hardest part of job was negotiating price with customers.
good,"Everyday at work was fun with awesome co-workers. Learned a lot of things about completions and well work activities. The company should give more opportunity to the seniors rather than taking new employees. Company management was reasonable. Salary and allowances are highly paid."
good,"trabalho em equipe , de muito aprendizado e companheirismo ."
good,"1) A typical day at work was comprised of an often-consistent workload and continued improvement. "
good,"When oil is up, they are great to work for. Management seemed to genuinely care about you most of the time. Career advancement opportunities come faster than most industries. If you're looking to make a lot of money fast, they'll work you until you break...and you will break before they stop working you. If you value family and friends, you will have neither when you get back home. This can be a high stress job and isn't for the weak minded. "
good,"Bardzo dobra atmosfera , swietni pracownicy."
good,"overall I liked Baker, I believe the merger plans with Haliburton caused the upper management to stop focusing on Baker and on how they would personally survive"
good,"10/2015 - ATUAL - IFF - IND. QUÍMICA DE FRAGRÂNCIAS. ( temporário de seis meses )"
good,Before work would start in the morning me and other coworkers would sit in the break room area and talk about the day before whether it was about home life or work related. We start work with a safety meeting & talk about projects for the day or week. Something new could always be learned at shop & offshore on a daily basis. Management was involved every step of the way in our daily projects and making sure it was done safely. Maintenance on the units when chipping cement and getting in & out of tight spaces I would say was the hardest part of my job. When I do a good job for a customer offshore and he greets me with a handshake and a smile with a look of confidence in me.
good,"•	Supports all production/process by designing related drawings as well as assist in the execution phases of capital projects. "
good,"Boa empresa para se trabalhar ."
good,Good place to work that always kept you busy and had a good management.good group of workmates and learned a lot of new skills from them
good,"The pay is good in the oilfield, the time off is far and few between.  Hard to plan family life.  I did really enjoy my job though, the guys I worked with were like brothers."
good,"Ótima empresa, cresci e aprendi muito nesses 3 anos, foi onde dei início ao meu conhecimento em equipamentos de Petróleo e ampliei muito minha rede de amigos"
good,"Working in this geo market is a tough one, we are very isolated at the top if the state of Alaska, making daily operations more difficult. We work 12 hr days 21 days in a row and receive 21 off. Management is promoted from with in and are very skilled in operations but have no management experience, which makes it very difficult to deal with sometimes. The oilfield teaches you common sense, to watch each-others back, hard work, dedication, time management and many other valuable skills. All of this becomes worth it receiving the 21 days off. I use them to travel often and continuously  experience new adventures in life."
good,"lots of hours spent on the computer, but every day was different. loved being able to compare the old manufacturing methods to the new ones, and realize the 50 year old Baker Hughes design was significantly superior in certain profitable ways. however the lack of social interaction, and proper upper management, made it very apparent that people were not valued."
good,"poor company performance due to overall deterioration of oil & gas"
good,"GE is a great company to work for. The co-workers are exceptional people. The company takes pride in having good employees and the many years of service they provide. The company currently is not looking to advance any employee career at this time due to oil prices. This was no surprise to anyone. The hard work I have put in is now going unnoticed. This doesn't make working here as enjoyable as it used to. I hope that one day this company will be a great career path for someone, but at this time I do not feel that it is mine."
good,"Good company with a lot of opportunities in the past, however with the buy out its a little bit unstable.  Upper management is not concerned with the concept ""rain day fund"".  Material waste is chronic.  However, people are smart and well qualified with years of experience."
good,"opportunities are for those who love to spend all their time to network with managers and not doing what the business is required. "
good,Conservadora con Burocracia para tomar decisiones; gran campo en el desarrollo de carrera dentro de la región.
good,"I worked for Baker Hughes Coiled Tubing. When the price of oil bottomed out, Baker shut down the entire product line. Every Coiled Tubing employee in North America was laid off."
good,"Worked on a frat crew, the yard was good and the people were good. don't know how it will be now because of the buyout. Most of the people that i know don't work there anymore."
good,"There is an extraordinary amount of development opportunities within GE and with a good manager, these training are plentiful for high performing employees.  GE has a lot structure and sometimes seems there are processes in place only so some people can have their jobs and the process adds no value to the business; many opportunities for improvement."
good,"If you work hard and make the right connections, growth can be achieved. As with any Oil & Gas company, job security can be an issue during an economic downturn."
good,"everyone is like family when working together"
good,"I enjoyed working there. work was 12-14 hrs (included drive time). Learned a lot of equipment and Management was there when needed. Got along with 95% of the other co-workers, hardest part was rigging in 3"" Iron in mud up to my knees. Some of the best times were the drives to different places, and during the summer and the Coil broke down, could relax and read a book or clean equipment at a nice pace.  A shame that it is no more."
good,"Great safety and service culture.  Unfortunately purchased by Halliburton so the future is unclear.  "
good,if they were still around I would still be with them.  Halliburton bought them out.  I liked them.good company too bad they arent going to be around
good,fellow employees had great attitudes and made the day enjoyable. had a great time working for the company. if had the opportunity to go back and work for this company again I would definitely do it again.
good,Overall good experience. Liked what I did and who I worked with. Had a good experience with contracting for Quicksilver. The people were a lot of fun to work with. I just wished the industry was not so up and down.
good,"The working culture is awesome in the company."
good,"Poor management, lack of direction, lack of things to do in a day to day basis."
good,Physical labor as well as technical skills needed daily to complete complex electric submersible pump installations.
good,"on call basis, used many different applications in assisting the customer. i loved that each job provided a different challenge. working outside in all types of weather was fun unless it was during a blizzard which would present its own set of challenges. each job meant new people and new challenges. the management was active in supporting me in the field but at times would make promises that they could not guarantee. daily and weekly reports as well as billing were a regular aspect of my job. keeping a task list along with a strict inventory of tools being used was a necessity, and regular communication with my managers and the customer representatives on each location was key. my job had so many variables that success was based on how much we were able to save the customer."
good,"Daily emails communicate management changes, but communications at lower levels are not detailed enough to fully understand changes."
good,good environment good hours helpful co-workers very good management most enjoyable part of the job was getting out town on you're hitch
good,My time with Baker Hughes was a great experience just to get a feel for the oil field and how things worked. I worked with a great group of co workers we handled any task accurately and in a timely fashion. The hardest part was handling task when we were short handed but we managed to get work done.
good,"Oilfield company with a diverse portfolio in fishing, completions and fracturing.  Go to work and come back home every couple of weeks or so."
good,Nothing but great projects and opportunities. Very Enjoyable culture and environment.  Many great locations commute wise
good,I liked working for Baker good benefits and wages just not enough business in California for wireline product line.
good,Global roll outs. Wave releases.Enhancements with a copy of 70% of existing set ups.
good,"Bently Nevada offers a very relaxed work environment with almost no penalties for compromising safety or quality. On the flip side, there are virtually no goals other than show up and complete each project. "
good,"Review costs for two projects:"
good,"Uma empresa muito boa de trabalhar mais nem todo o lugar e o lugar perfeito de se trabalhar, baker tinha muito a oferecer a seus funcionarios a respeito de segurança mais deixava outros casos pedentes e o caso de avaliação de seus funcionarios e planos de carrera."
good,Learned how to manage  hectical office administration works
good,Tienen un excelente sistema de evaluación en función del performance y valores corporativos.
good,"Is a great place to work , can work at own pace . But no advancement for me here , and I am not even 50 yet . Work is physical at some phases of the job , but nothing to complain about ."
good,"Maintained good relation with Vendor’s and Management."
good,"- Ambiente dinâmico e ativo com muito trabalho, aquisição de conhecimentos e amizade."
good,"Good co-workers, descent pay, management seems to treat workers as step children. No room for advancement. Good ol boy system!"
good,Review daily assembly schedule and assign work tasks to appropriate assembly staff.  Schedule deliveries of finished units.  Insure proper inventory levels for assembly requirements.  Interface with upper management on any problems that may occur and suggest solutions.  The hardest part was the short notice usually given on orders.  The best part of the job was that it was never boring and very fast paced.
good,"My team had been without supervision for a year and a half, therefore initially it was very challenging.  Within five months we had shown marked improvement in all areas and where on our way to becoming a great department."
good,"Great company, However much of their best employees leave this company to higher paying competitor companies. The pay at Baker is lower end but the benefits and training is very good."
good,"Baker Hughes has a very laid back work environment - as long as the work is being completed correctly, management is happy. Along with the laid back work environment, the wardrobe is laid back as well - not too professional and jeans are allowed."
good,Good to work if you have a good project. GE Management practises are the best in the world
good,The particular location of employment does not represent the Corporation well.
good,"awesome place to work, great people who are willing to teach but too many layoffs"
good,"Baker Hughes is a great company to work for if you don't mind long hours. The pay is very competitive. The only downside is the oilfield industry is not the most stable, this however doesn't reflect on the company itself."
good,"24/7 on call work, new dist. manager is great, a couple managers need help.. great co-workers"
good,"Baker Hughes is a great place to work from challenging opportunity’s "
good,"Work starts prompts at 8 am, lunch at 12:30 pm, ends at 5 pm.  Proof read price books in offshore production department.  Very tedious.  I really did not like this assignment, but it paid fairly well."
good,"20-30 hour shifts beginning when customer requested.  Repairing equipment in the field on the job under all weather conditions.  A great time with co-workers and learned a great deal about industrial equipment and heavy trucks.  As well as learned about the oil production business.  Very long hours, great pay and benefits.  2 week on 1 week off schedule.  Many expenses covered by company, per-diem and lodging covered and travel."
good,Otimos trabalhadores e competentes
good,Stock material pull work orders and drive forlift.
good,"I enjoyed most to create business Units from scracht. BHI was a fantastic Company and a good place to work. After the last reorganization in 2009, the Company lost the core values culture, which were key to develop a competitive workforce, provoking a lot of people migration to different jobs."
good,Its good to start work with and learned a lot. Good for freshers and starters
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar, gostaria de poder trabalhar novamente um dia."
good,"Surrounded by good colleagues thus it is a good environment to work at. Flexi work hours, transported provide to the doorstep & many departmental events to appreciate the teamwork!"
good,"Started as a gun loader  and now I'm the manager of the gun loaders."
good,Baker Hughes is known for its collaborative and teamwork culture.  The companies biggest asset are its employees.  Employees are encouraged to take on new challenges and learn new skills.
good,The majority of coworkers have great work ethic and strive to make a difference.  Leadership focus is on what is right in front of them and do not see the long term and big pictures.  Priorities shift too frequently.
good,"Baker Hughes' benefits and competitive pay make this a good place to work. The downfall is when the market is down, like all oil/gas companies, they have reduction in employees."
good,During my time at Baker Hughes there were several opportunities for advancement and courses that were offered to help with advancement.  The company has a family environment with great people to work for and with.
good,"BHGE has as top priority HSE, Quality and Compliance. With this 3 pillars, company is always focus to offer the best and the better solution to our customer/partners."
good,"I undergo my internship here for 6 months duration and i totally love their culture, management and the way they appreciate their workers. the most enjoyable moment in this company was during the closing where we need to stay till late night to complete the work but we are rewarded with free foods :)"
good,"GE es una empresa maravillosa, encuentras todo lo que deseas: experiencia profesional, crecimiento y beneficios economicos"
good,"I learned a lot by leading projects such as plant consolidations, etc. Very cyclical environment due to being an O&G service company. Merger with GE O&G has created some culture shifting that is not always adapted."
good,"La parte mas dificil del trabajo es el factor humano, las maquinas pueden programarse pero el personal necesita supervision en cada momento, es necesario tener un buen liderazgo y coordinacion entre los elementos que conforman el ambiente laboral para que surga un buen engranaje en el personal y las exigencias del trabajo puedan salir adelante."
good,"Learned a lot about chemicals and the oil refining industry. Met a lot of industry people that helped me network to the next stepping stone career. Worked diverse jobs such as labs, tank farms, process units, etc."
good,"Very fast pace, deadlines on projects and challenging. The  hardest part of the job is to meeting deadlines on clients requests. I have enjoyed most of my time here."
good,Overall it is a great place to work. The only cons would be that there is not a lot of advancement. The management is not that great at the moment but i do feel like there is better changes to come.
good,"If you don't get lost in the shuffle of thousands of employees, advancement can be easy to come by.  They are BIG though, and perfectly good people can go unnoticed.  Regardless, their benefits are top notch and their training is quite good."
good,Great support from Corporate.  Decent leadership.  Developed good working relationships with good people.  Needs some attention to management response and accountability
good,"Over all a good place to work good benefits nice environment 8 hour work days no over time low pay and pay raise were not good, not fast past relaxed place to work"
good,"Un dia de trabajo normal es, como en cualquier empresa de rubro, de 8 a 18. En los puestos de alta responsabilidad ademas uno debe ocuparse de cuestiones excepcionales con un mayor rango horario y fines de semana."
good,A good job if advancement isn't a personal goal for ones self. If u are driven to excel and push yourself look elsewhere. It is a very safe friendly environment though with good benefits.
good,"Great company to work for when the industry is good,  If the market starts to slump as with any other business layoffs do occur in masses.  Leadership within the company can be somewhat undesirable as they seem to be focused on just themselves other than the employees or company milestones."
good,"Orario di lavoro flessibile che va giornalmente organizzato in base alle email ed eventi programmati sul calendario."
good,"Good benefits, convinnt work tmings medical insurance , airticket for family, holiday pakage good work timings appreciation at  work, good employee rewards"
good,"Pay scale was low"
good,"I have no complaint about my time at Baker, I really liked the people I worked with.  The company has a very long history of oil service.  Good place to work, roll up your sleeves and hold on, it is very fast pace."
good,Great place to work if you are task oriented. Great learning opportunities within the job. Unfortunately they prefer to promote their trainee students only.
good,"Fast pace, Challenging, Something different everyday. Very dynamic atmosphere. You will always learn something new.  Very diverse employees. You are the driver of your career."
good,"Always have challenges in work , so it gives very good knowledge and professional experience to enhance my skills and ability to perform and achieve my goals."
good,"BHGE has a collaborative environment, and with them joining GE, they become a powerhouse. The will provide you all the tools you "
good,The work environment is challenging since priorities do change from day to day.  There are a number of opportunities for internships and GE does offer an Edison graduate degree.
good,Overall this is a great company to work for its just unfortunate that all 3 locations I have worked at is plagued by horrible management. They to find new ways to find better leaders to put in place at the manufacturing level.
good,"Good place to work for, I just don't agree with some of the recent management changes and actions that I have been put through because of others actions."
good,Love working at GE. It was challenging at times but was worth every minute of it. People would help and very courtesy when you had questions about any job assignment.
good,most days were watching machines run and cleaning equipment. hardest part of the job was being out in the weather .most enjoyable part was having a week off every three weeks.
good,"People were nice to work with, work was easy. Excellent manager both times I was employed at Baker Hughes. Would still be there if there had not been lay offs."
good,A regular work day would be 10-12 hours.  We worked indoors and outdoors and adjusted to being in the elements.  I was able to train in other departments and learned new tasks.  The hardest part of the job is that it is contingent on how the Oil & Gas market is.
good,EDP made skills diversity a priority.  Exploring my ability to contribute is a great privilege.  Females are not prioritized as assets unless they are key contributors.
good,"Turned out to be very good starting point. Have some great co-workers. Good work/family balance. Fair pay. However, R&D management lacks certainty and direction. Cannot provide any solid guidance."
good,"* Fast paced work place"
good,strong safety culture with extensive training.  hours go off rotations that provide excellent pay.  work is monitored and evaluated for continuous safety.
good,"es una empresa que cuenta con tecnología y programas para desarrollar el trabajo muy buenos, lo que hace que sea una diferncia entre otras empresas lo único malo es que no valoran al personal y puedo decir por experiencia las personas hacen la empresa no ella a ellos por lo que deberían de tomar encuenta los comentarios o sugerencias para fortalecer el crecimiento, por que es una buena empresa."
good,Baker Hughes was a work experience where it was very gratifying to make a difference and it was a tremendous learning experience. No other company provided such an extensive and comprehensive list of opportunities to develop and harvest.
good,Constant review of procedures and compliance with client and Customs requirements to fit with internal processes and company operation set-up and compliance.
good,Company  did  not  seem  to  care about  the mud  loggers  as  much  as  the  other  divisions  with  in  the  company.  The  fellow employees for the most part treated everyone as a family.
good,At the beginning I really enjoyed working here.  Then things changed and it was all about work and no home life.  When we had changes in management it all went down hill.
good,"good place to work , met lots of good guys there 12 years  CNC machinist , did my own set ups programing .  good machines & tooling . had day shift 8 hour days   . lots of help if needed to preform a task someone always willing to help out .  on site cafeteria was a plus at lunch time ."
good,"The typical day at work is, work work work work! "
good,Worked for BHGE for a summer internship and enjoyed it greatly. Supervisor and mentor were both great to work with. Work life balance was ideal. Would love to work here as a full-time employee.
good,"Being part of IT Operations, Client Services my job allows me to be in touch of almost everyone using computers & networks, but I never faced any negative situation. Everyone here are very understanding and supportive and committed to their work."
good,"Long hours away from home rewarded with excellent pay and benefits. A great learning experience, that will help you develop many skills to propel your career"
good,Great company to work with but with changes and merger its harder to advance. The department I'm in is ok but I'm looking for growth and can't find it here.
good,Opens up doors to experience and travel the world. I found myself working in multiple countries and the pay is also very good. Great opportunity to for exposure to the energy sector.
good,"The typical day started at 8:30."
good,Enjoyed the work environment but the Oil and gas industry is too volatile for my comfort level.  There was plenty of opportunity for advancement between layoffs for the person who was forward leaning and took the tough jobs and succeeded in them.
good,Baker Hughes Inc is a service company and I was reminded of that every day that  I went offshore. This was a great experience and something that I will never forget. Working offshore is something that everyone should get to experience at least once.
good,The company offered many benefits and profit sharing. The people here were not so great. lack of Management and supervision lead to much chaos with in the company.
good,Only issue is the over abundance a career climbing young adults who never bother to master anything. Only interested in their next step up the ladder.
good,Baker Hughes has a great group of people working them.  I'm enjoying the experience.  I'm in a contract position and can only speak to the company from that perspective.
good,work at the shop or drive to rig site and supervise operations. talk with company rep and do job that is required. head back to shop clean equipment and do paperwork
good,"Overall rating"
good,"With frequent changes in the company I see a bright future within the company."
good,Baker is a good company with great benefits.  Progression is tricky but is available. Everyone I worked with across the 7 product lines was knowledgeable and helpful.
good,"Good job, but certain people just should not be managers, (M.E.)"
good,Baker Hughes gave me the opportunity of a lifetime for anyone wanting to sell directly in the oil and gas industry. My experience in the BHI Sales Academy was great! It was a full year of both classroom and field application learning. My experience working as an Account Manager was fantastic and everything I thought it would be!
good,Very diverse working atmosphere.  Ability to learn many different techniques from colleagues is a bonus.  The camaraderie throughout the levels/departments/facilities are genuine.
good,"Good place to work. Opportunities domestic and international. Most management are motivational and let you do your work. Pay is on par with other service companies.,"
good,"Empresa do seguimento de Oil e Gás, com boa oferta de emprego, profissionais dinâmicos e treinados."
good,"Never a dull moment with lots of different tasks to perform. "
good,"To work in an environment that will allow me to utilize my hydraulic, electrical,  problem solving, management, and mechanical skills, gain experience, and eventually manage a highly productive group of individuals."
good,"great coworker,cean environment,free lunch every now and then "
good,"Good management team, but quick to judge at times. Some of the people they used for training should not have been in that position. Overall they were above the average I have encountered."
good,"Great work place, will fire  you once yearly sales quotas are meet according to business and state policy. This company  is a great place to work if you find it easy fitting in with the crowd they treat you well. Be weary if you stand out they may assume you're secretive with introvert personality, they're all about building relationships with workers there's a lot of favoritism with this company if they like you, you may've found your dream job."
good,"I started with Baker as a TST trainee in 1976, and advanced to Specialist in Sand Control.  I was able to travel and help out internationally when asked."
good,"I learned a lot at Baker Hughes, very hard work at times but normally interesting and challenging. Traveled to many different countries."
good,"Professional med over 10 år i det industrielle marked, som kommer fra aeronautiske sammensatte reparationsservice; udvikling, afprøvning og certificering af tunge erhvervskøretøjer; og i de sidste 6 år har jeg atained the teknik anvendt på produktet processer, design og fremstilling, i olie- og gasindustrien."
good,"Working for Baker-Hughes was amazing, they had everything and more you'd expect a great company to have (great pay, benefits, room for advancement, pool table, etc...) however as the company grew and switched to Baker One the job basically felt like working for a faceless corporation. Started bringing in people from the outside to run the shop and pretty much killed the culture and chemistry we worked to build together as a team. Amazing first 6 to 7 years though."
good,"A typical day at work is pretty much the same thing. Work lunch work and leave. Nothing exciting happens on the typical basis. "
good,"Good working environment and peoples together."
good,"A typical day at work includes duties such as in site tools inventory and daily drilling operation reports. I learned the basics of drilling and also the basics about drill bits, then I was able to apply my knowledge in the drilling processes. The most difficult of the job was to stay away from home for long periods of time."
good,"Genoeg afwisseling en een prettige werksfeer."
good,"Flexible work schedule on the top side.  On the down side, multiple layers of management can make it challenging to get things done. Very good co-workers and a friendly environment."
good,"Good working environment, friendly colleagues and managers. Provide trainings for new staff, good career advancement and is a good place to work at with work life balance working style."
good,"It can be a very fun job when working for the right managers. For some it is hard to continue evolving with the company. This tends to be a fault of mgmt, they don't all want to put the time and effort into helping other succeed. Not with all individuals or managers, but its a big company that can afford to pay someone else to do it."
good,A lot of turmoil. A difficult place to work.Every one is in a survival mode and just trying to hang in there and make it through the merger.
good,Excellent company to build a career with. Good training and support. I really enjoyed my 11 years working for BHI overseas. I would work for them again.
good,"This company has it's ups and downs just like any other company. Working in Customer Care, there are constant changes and shifts in management which keeps us with questions due to inconsistent leadership. It started us off with us being more focused on the customer to morphing into a major call center (in which they told us this wasn't). There's always SOMEthing to do. If not, they'll find something to keep you busy (which I don't mind)."
good,"Empresa com cultura de compliance, segurança e qualidade bem difundidos. Bons profissionais em ambiente com oportunidades de crescimento."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Baker before the downturn of the Oil Field the group of guys I worked with where awesome the overall experience was great and the room for growth was there, long hours 20 plus a day but if you can handle that days off and the paycheck makes it great."
good,"Excelente empresa para trabajar,  con excelentes prestaciones superiores a las de la ley y con un equilibrio perfecto entre la vida personal y la laboral con mucha flexibilidad."
good,Baker Hughes gives you a chance to build a great career and future for yourself and your family. It's a great company that has positions worldwide and a company with great benefits.
good,I have no complaints with Baker Hughes. I simply want to work closer to home. Working on the road makes time spent with co-workers extensive but luckily all my co workers are easy going and we all work well together.
good,Typical day included monitoring the drilling that was constantly happening. Making sure the wellbore was drilled in the proper direction while taking into account collision avoidance of other wellbores. Was able to work with a team of coworkers that never changed and performed very well together. Were able to efficiently and consistently drill some of the fastest wellbores ever in the Williston basin.
good,"GE over all is a good company they pay for certification and help you with a lot like education and assistance with family, work is good and scheduling is good, they work with you if you have family issues and will help any way they can, little micro managing but push you to be a leader and set the pace for others. benefits are good, health dental vision ect, discounts on GE products and insurance for car, home and life. good work environment and excellent open door policy, they reward the hard working and let the coaster pace at their own desire. paid holidays and 2 floating holidays to take in conjunction with paid holidays 14 days paid vacation a year."
good,Great local culture and leaders. Did not enjoy working with or being dictated to by Houston/OKC. Great sales training. Great technical support. Great engineering staff.
good,Working for Bakerhughes has been a very interesting journey to say the least. Hours were long and the pay was good. Not much time for family and friends. Everything was going great until the day they laid off all the frac workers. The buyout and never happened!
good,"A typical day can include enquiries from the machine shop, various engineering queries, varied design work."
good,"Working for Baker Hughes was exciting and I feel that poor Managment was an issue. There were no promotions and pay raises, or recognition for a job well done."
good,"Learned a lot during my 19 years."
good,"Great company with excellent salary, great benefits and talented employees. Management can be demanding and job culture promotes new ideas."
good,Get to work and attend safety meetings daily. Learned a lot of new things in the oil industry. Management was always changing so cant really say anything about that. Coworkers were great. Hardest part of the job was being there for so many hours. The most enjoyable was being able to work on equipment i hadnt seen before.
good,"Been with Baker Hughes for almost 2 years. Great company, great benefits. Typical day at work was come in, address any emails, and then see what orders were due to the next morning. Then start checking and making sure all the correct parts were pulled and check all quantities for the order. Enter the order into SAP."
good,"Clean, well lit and ventilated shop space. Quality equipment to work with. Good training and strong safety culture. not much advancement unless employees pushed."
good,While working for Baker Hughes I learned a lot of new things on a daily basis. It seemed like everyday you were either travelling or learning new techniques to complete jobs.
good,"Lavoro ad alto contenuto organizzativo, necessita' di sapersi districare in situazioni lavorative sotto pressione, ambiente lavorativo estremamente dinamico ma ottimi colleghi. La parte piu difficle e' il costante stress dovuto al momento dell'industria, quella piu facile l'orario e il tempo libero."
good,"A typical day was long hours but a great experience. I learned how to manage certain situations on my own and how to observe and subtract problems from occurring while performing my duties for various customers. Management had its ups and downs throughout my time with Baker. For the most part management for me was a great experience, I had no complaints. My co-workers were very diverse and open to conversations, I got along fine with everyone. The hardest part about my job was being away from home at times weeks even a month or more depending on the circumstances. The other thing was at times I didn't know when I would be going home due to the constant changes in our off-day schedules. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting the opportunity to take over certain jobs and become the supervisor in most situations. Also meeting a ton of new people just about everyday and learning how every thing within the operations came together to make the job successful."
good,"Typical day at work would start at 4am. would last around 13 to 14 hrs. It would involve several meetings safety and operations, assigning jobs to shop hands, evaluate shop hands work, input work hours, inventory shop supply's, help train shop foreman's over all the aspects of there job, review JSAs, make out lift planes, Help the shop hands assemble and repair equipment, review job work packs, work with the inventory dept. to get jobs lined out for the rest of the week. Good learning working in a different country good challenge."
good,Got alot of orgainizing to do. New to the oil and gas industry.  Has no pay scale you might get hired and make more than someone that has been there 10yrs.
good,"Have worked the weekend shift for almost 3 years."
good,"I was the operations coordinator for Baker Hughes Iraq. I set up the pressure pumping base in Basra, and managed the day to day running of my product line. I managed the P&L account and ensured that we started in budget, But meet our customers needs. One of my responsible was to manage the crew rotations and visa requirements"
good,This is a good company that requires a small tweak at the very top and this company can give their major competitors a run for their money
good,"Busy work days in Baker Hughes that requires time management, multiple tasking. Every single day deadlines to be met. Good team work ."
good,"Baker Hughes is one of the leading oil field companies providing various oil field service.  Overall their Baker Hughes Inteq department located in OKC was a great place to get a start in the oil field making good wages.  Aside from the great wages there was a lot to be sacrificed such time outside of work.  The overall culture and mentality of the company when it came to the blue collar workers is that you belong to them, and your life needs to soley be based and revolved around being available even when you were not on call.  During my four year tender with the company my work schedule was changed in excess of 8 + times, anywhere from days to night to seven days on seven days off and revolving weekends on call sometimes even 48 hours on call.  Often times middle management would leave after a normal 8 hour business day and it would be up to the shop lead to fulfill supervisor roles, sometimes having to resort to a phone directory to find proper contact information to complete an operation because management become mysteriously impossible to get a hold of  after business hours and the next day you would be held accountable for what not able to get done in their absence.  Several of the supervisors would go days without even attending work and would try to communicate to there shop leads via cell phones on their convince around their personal lives.  Before the recent regression in the oil field, several member of management  and certain shop leads were receiving illegal kick backs breaking company conduct policy's.  HR and management were very close at this location.  The last"
good,"empresa boa para de trabalhar,muitos amigos dentro ,aprendi bastante no periodo que eu fiquei lá,a direção é boa,os colegas de trabalho a maioria são ótimas pessoas,a parte mais difícil do trabalho é que são montagens diferentes ninguém grava todas assim tão rápido,a parte agradável é que não tem correria,com calma sempre até mesmo pra evitar acidentes."
good,"Baker Hughes was an excellent place to work when I started there in 2012 but as more management has left Schlumberger to join the ranks at Baker Hughes, the company has become much more cut-throat and less employee oriented."
good,coordenaçao de operaçoes offshore para acquisiçao de datos petrofisicos para avaliaçao comercial
good,A great group of people. we were like family. our work was organizing and loading chemicals for use in the field each day. we worked with very little warehouse space. That made the hardest part of this along with the winter months when we used reefers to store our chemicals in.
good,"Baker Hughes has been a great place to work. It offered me a great career with training, opportunity, and competitive benefits and compensation. With the decline in oil prices and pending merger with Halliburton, many decisions are being made to try and shore up profits at the expense of over 35% of the workforce.  They will never be able to replace the vast amount of experienced workers that they are losing, and the workers that are left are under pressure to do more with less every day. Senior management is also protecting their own and it is middle management and the regular workers who are feeling the worst of it."
good,I have already entered my evaluation on Baker Hughes on the pervious request.  Great company to work for as long as the price of Oil is up.
good,It seems that the easiest way to advance is by being friends with management on a local basis. Besides that the company is a good company to work for.
good,"Il mio lavoro è stimolante. Non è facile definire una giornata tipo visto che eroghiamo corsi, sia a Firenze presso il Florence Learning Center, sia presso le sedi dei nostri clienti."
good,Excellent company for undergraduate engineers willing to put the extra personal time to develop their skills in the company.
good,"GE Oil & Gas is a company that is forever changing. The job you do today may not be the job you do tomorrow. Just as the person you work with today may not be the person you work with tomorrow. Overall the job is interesting, the salary and benefits are good. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the sales guys. They were smart, helpful and gracious."
good,"Family orientated, great management.Decent pay,decent benefits, hour lunch weekends off.I loved my job and I loved my boss but when oil prices slumped layoffs began and I was laid off. I would recommend Baker Hughes to friends."
good,"Ótimos benefícios, salário e ambiente de trabalho."
good,"lay back environment to work in. good pay and benefits, vacation, sick great days off .the most enjoyable part of the job was go out to the drilling rigs."
good,Limited opportunities to advance based on recognition for good performance.  Good people and quality products although quite a few personnel have left for advancement opportunities outside the company.
good,"Days would start with safety meetings on future tasks."
good,Was a good company to work for. Team members in my department were treated as responsible adults with little supervision required from management.
good,I worked with this company for over 24 years as a senior technician / Team Leader. I ran all functions of a 4 person production team. My team built analyzer systems . My responsibilities were making sure the drawing's and BOM's were right and I was responsible for training and inventory . Also I was responsible for all documentation for all certified part's and component's . also I interacted with three engineering groups when it came to the design and function of all the system's that were built . I have done a lot of manufacturing processing design an lean projects .
good,Its where i really learned about down hole tools and the way tools can set or not set. The company was very good about teaching you about the mechanics that goes into building and redressing down hole tools.
good,Day to day operations with a lot of webex meetings and a lack of focus on the business and industry. I learned that a large company  needs to work with the field staff - who have a better perspective on the market place in their area and a better understanding of customer needs. I found that in a huge company there is more focus on numbers than on strategy on how to achieve greater numbers. Management performance was almost inexistent and only contacted you when they needed an update on financials. I had a great team of co-workers who went above and beyond to help build our success. The hardest part of the job was to watch a new company come and take over and dismantle everything and everyone who made our previous company a success. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting and meeting new people and building a successful business.
good,"Enjoyed the people I worked with, very easy work schedule. Was rarely challenged and had no opportunity for advancement, even if I was pro-active to move to different positions. I left this company for that reason."
good,The psl I worked at wasn't a bad environment. Management wasn't the best and the facility was a little old but other than that it wasn't a bad place to work.
good,"I was working for 29 years with Baker Hughes and it is good place for work with good salary. "
good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho."
good,"Is a good company to work for, and the people are generally very easy to get along with, and very helpful. the benefits are grate"
good,"Employed for 18 months as a field engineer."
good,My last position was a buyer at a Houston manufacturing plant. I originally started as a drafter at the same plant. I enjoyed all my years and was saddened by the RIF.
good,My experience working for GE Oil and Gas was Ideal. Great company. Treated their employees very well. I left because they offered me another contract instead of hiring me on full time.
good,"Looking after the training of 600+ global subsea engineers meant that no two days were ever the same. "
good,"There is no usual day at work you come in to something different every day its exciting and new, though its not for everyone it takes a toll on you mentally physically and also a huge chunk of your personal time. The people you work with in pressure pumping you will be around as much as if not more then your family. I would recommend this job to someone single or who is looking to retire young."
good,"Exelente empresa, con mucho dinamismo, poca posibilidad de crecimiento profecional dentro de esta."
good,"Responsible for maintaining the chemical warehouse in an ordering fashion, making sure the inventory is correct, scheduling trucks for pick up, loading trucks.

Also travel around to offsite locations to do inventory checks, other responsibilities has included dealing with the mechanical side of the warehouse, disposing chemical waste doing all the GR’s for the company, an managing assets.]"
good,Baker Hughes is not shy when it comes to training their people.  They have a first class training program.  You always know that you are working with well trained individuals in the field.
good,I've enjoyed working at Baker.The pay is competitive. Schedule is good. Mostly cool coworkers.  Self supervising shop.
good,I was in charge of a 4 man crew servicing gas and oil wells. The employees were dependable and hard working and kept the equipment in good working order.
good,Day starts a 5am with a briefing from the previous shift rounds are made to ensure proper working function and controls are in order make sure parts are up to company standards.
good,"Ótima empresa para se trabalhar, onde investe no profissional e dá total condição de crescimento dentro da organização, salário compatível com o mercado, pagamento em dia e ambiente bom, só precisa melhorar na qualidade de vida dos funcionários."
good,"Revisar equipos y  herramientas que estén listo para instalación."
good,"I work on a variety of equipment: the Falcon, Bulk Trucks, air trailers and booster pumps.  Before the Falcon leaves the yard, I check to see that all the valves are working correctly, the pmp, micromotion, knife gate, and the panels are in safe working order.  Before the Bulk Truck leaves the yard, it is checked for the right type and amount of cement for the job.  All heads and manifolds are checked to be sure that all is up to date and ready to go out on a job.  Cement and water are checked for accuracy for the job.  Once on location, responsible for the trucks to be set up in the best working positions.  All cement is checked again for the correct chemical mixture that the Company Man requires on the job.   Cement and water are checked again for the job and checked that the silo is filled.  Work with the fill up of cement, iron rigging it up from the Falcon to the rig floor.  Watch for hazards and safety for the crew when on and off location.  Once back at the yard, equipment is cleaned and maintained for service on the next job."
good,"We would start out with an overall safety meeting, and then delegate work to be performed. Would have to prioritize units to be completed. Scheduling for third party repairs as needed. Compounded a list of parts needed, then would verify parts ordered. Would utilize spreadsheets to keep track of parts and time line of work. Diagnose mechanical, hydraulic, and electrical problems. Gave daily reports, manage budgets for specific units. Mentoring the new employees. Positively encouraged employees to strive for excellence, and keep on track with company guidelines and training. "
good,"This company has a very quality standard and quality control. Offers a good salary and benefits. but, workers expend too much time on the phone and meetings and presentations"
good,"I enjoyed the people that I worked with. My last job was Well Planning, my day to day included: "
good,"I came from and built a team composed of talented people that were building commercial software for resale. Switching to the buyer side of the equation we tried to convince management that developing in-house software was the most cost effective and productive (time to market) option available. Management preferred to purchase a COTS and attempt to configure it to meet the needs of the company, it did not and resulted in a multi million dollar mistake which became shelfware. I advised against the option and of course am no longer with the company. I am looking for a forward thinking company that is not afraid to take a risk and understand this is where the separation occurs. I have a proven track record of providing exceptional solutions to problems. I can assemble a team that delivers, just provide the need."
good,"Management is good and safety is emphasized. They will work with you to accommodate days off when needed. Coworkers are very very fun. They abuse the heck out of you when you make a mistake, but you usually wont make the mistake again!!"
good,Job and pay are good. Really enjoyed the job and the people that I worked with. Management is probably the biggest problem with the job. Not many of them are qualified to be managers and because of this it is difficult to advance. No real push from good leadership to do well. Company has a hard time wondering why people don't want to work at this facility or they just simply don't care.
good,Class preparation meeting the learners. Start the day with a good story relevant to the daily activity. Engagement with good collaboration is the key to adult learning.
good,"As I spent my most of the time in the field so i had little knowledge of management and work culture in office, which is really  totaly different from field, i learnt may new things by working in office as a Sr Tech Support Engineer for cementing, coil tubing and Reliability and Tubular running servcies.Overall it's a good  experience by working with Baker Hughes India."
good,"Great work environment. "
good,Baker Hughes is a company which was one of my dream come true. After a  long time got back to work in an oilfield company. Baker Hughes is a multinational company. Timings are good. Working in a multinational company work load is more so have to sit for a long time but have no issues in it as its my work. Salary pay is good. My colleagues are very co-operative.
good,"Work life balance is good.  "
good,"Baker Hughes é uma grande empresa de petróleo e como tal a remuneração é excelente, paga curso de inglês, táxi para casa se passar de 10 horas de trabalho diário, tem café da manhã (pão, manteiga e capuchinho) paga lanche nas horas extras. Volume de trabalho intenso, ferramentas de trabalho excelentes que nos ajuda a ter rapidez. Baixa oportunidade de crescimento. Paga hora extra. Não tem PL. Plano de saúde muito bom. Muito precocessos pra efetuar tarefas simples. Ruim pra começar carreira.  As decisões são tomadas pela Baker da Ameríca Latina sem análise exatamente a filial de determinada região."
good,"Worked with Sales Engineer on job design and provided support during job execution."
good,I am glad to be surrounded by smart people working to envisage and develop what the industry needs. The teams i have encountered are very innovative and resourceful
good,"BHI is a good company to work for.  If they were not moving to Edmond, I wouldn't even think of leaving.  I want to work closer to home and that is south OKC"
good,"I have grown in this company from Helper to Field Specialist."
good,"15 days on 6 days off. Steady work, great people and great benefits."
good,enjoyable job and great benefits.....even doe we worked long hours they were good about letting you have breaks at your pace as long as work was getting done. And they were good about helping you maintain good work and doing it the right way.
good,"I like this job, but the job security is not great neither is the training"
good,"A good company overall. People are very good. "
good,I have been with Baker Hughes for almost 7 years. Each day I am learning something new and love to be challenged.
good,es una empresa comprometida con la seguridad de sus trabajadores y el medio ambiente así como la mejora de sus trabajadores mediante los cursos de tecnología y evaluaciones.
good,You are compensated for the work that you do and the atmosphere is laid back.  The people are great to work with.
good,Safety was secondary. Production came was the number one goal of the supervisors.
good,The shop is climate controlled but the temps inside the shop reach 80+ degrees. Some of the lower management are lacking in skills to say the least!
good,Baker Hughes is a huge international oilfield services company. they provide very good medical and financial benefits.
good,"From Dec 2009, I work in GE Oil & Gas Sourcing Dep. My first year was in Vibo Valentia plant, from 2011 I live in Florence working at TM Headquarter."
good,"I hauled cement or sand out to job sites in Saskatchewan, Alberta or Northern BC.  I enjoyed getting behind the wheel of the trucks and driving with some physical activity of helping rig up the equipment at times.  The worst part of the job was being away from the wife and home for weeks at a time but it also made you appreciate those things and not take them for granted.  Would still be working there but they shut down the southern district for pressure pumping."
good,"we would show up on location, have a safety meeting, "
good,"emailing customers, weekly conference calls, entering orders. un-creating moving tools and subs from receiving dock. hardest part of job was seeking lost tools or subs and feeling great when you found them. even if it took months to almost a year to find."
good,"Typisk dag på jobben kan være alt fra venting på været til trykktesting og sementering."
good,Baker is a great place to be trained. The company focuses on developing its employees.
good,"A good place to start out, it seems like there is good opportunities longterm, but not everyone is going to get them.  The training is overrated.  It is not very challenging and does not thoroughly prepare one for the field.  I have heard that they are working on improving it.  But the job is easy and the coworkers are helpful, so it is easy to get caught up.  There are however ways to get ahold of everything you need to know if you are motivated and build a formidable knowledge base, but a lot of that will have to be on your own time."
good,"When I started at GE I had little admin experience. I started from the bottom with very little knowledge and gained more experience than most admins at the company. I learned Oracle, Syteline, accounts payable and recievable in a short period of time. The management is outstanding and constantly provides an open door policy that has always been easy to trust. My co-workers are amazing people to be around, always exhibiting the greatest respect for team work. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be the fact that we were all like a family, if any of us had problems, we helped each other."
good,Baker Hughes is a good place to work at. We learn about safety and how to use the tools and the machines. They give us benefits. I give it a three star rating. They give us 30 minutes to finish our lunches. we have healthcare if we work at Baker Hughes.
good,"- I personally like the work environment, good and kind people."
good,The company is a great place to work. The Manufacturing Dept. is stressful at times but the people in the group are wonderful to work with.  The team feels like a big family.
good,"Challenging Work place. Metrics are very important."
good,"Al ser transferida a Usa, los companeros de trabajo fueron muy colaboradores y amigables siempre tratando de que se diera una adaptación rápida a la nueva posición. desde el primer día se presentaron bien establecidos los objetivos a lograr y bien implementados los procedimientos de trabajo."
good,"Ótima direção, aprendi a trabalhar e superar os desafios do trabalhos Offshore."
good,I work offshore with Baker Hughes. I monitor the well and view many parameters along with analyze cutting samples while drilling. We provided reports while drilling and work with others consistently on a day to day basis. I am in the SLS department and we work as one unit which is teamwork across the board. The difficult times are of course when you are away from the family for long periods of a time. Above all I like the company and what they stand for.
good,"Baker is a great company, but it seems as though advancement is impossable when tring to transition from the field to office."
good,"Needless to say this job is an oilfield job, you have to be built for this kind of work. The days can be long and hard, safety has to be your number one priority. I can't stress this point enough, things could happen and happen fast. YOU HAVE TO BE SAFE!!!!!! not only for you but the people that work around you. not to mention your family needs you, as well as mine needs me."
good,Big organization with complex business being run and an environment which always provokes self development and chanllenge
good,I worked in the refurbishment lab.  It was a new facility and many of the process bugs were being worked out.  I was treated fairly.  My only complaint was that the compensation was not conducive to the cost of living in that area.
good,"Uma empresa multinacional Americana, com uma forte cultura estabelecida, onde exige muito do funcionário a entregar seus objetivos e KPIs. "

good,"I have only worked in the retail buisiness, so it was a wonderful change to be able to learn the oil industry. I have worked with SAP, and feel that I can navigate through efficiently and accurately. I have initiated updated in the global routing system for Baker Hughes materials and codes."
good,Forever grateful to my supervisors for the work environment and all the opportunities offered to me to learn more valuable information.
good,Alot of changes recently. Long hours and alot of overtime. Continuous schedule means working holidays.
good,My job at baker Hughes was full of excitement meaning you never knew what you assignment was going to be throughout the day!!! Management team was available when you needed them but they wasn’t an on hand operation.. other then that a gtreat job to have
good,38 years with Baker Hughes. Overall it was a great experience. Benefits are really good. Good training and most direct reports were helpful. Job opportunities all over the world.
good,"Enjoyed my time there, but the oilfield is a volatile field to work in. The people were good and they sent you for training that helped to further your career."
good,You perform the same task nearly week to week. I learned a lot while working her dealing with the finishing procedures of the equipment. The managers were great and the team that I worked with were wonderful as well.
good,Good place to learn new things. The working culture fairly good. The hard part of my role at there is we did not had a fixed working hours. They do send employee for oversea training.
good,"I learn most of my skill while working at Baker hughes . "
good,"Baker Hughes, a GE company is the world’s first and only fullstream provider of integrated oilfield products, services and digital solutions. Drawing on a storied heritage of invention."
good,Baker Hughes merge with Halliburton try to go threw first but it did not go threw and a lot of people got laid off and then Baker Hughes merge with GE.
good,Its a good start to get into but if you're looking to advance have to kiss alot of butt On top the upper management does have their stuff together and ppl are always looking to burn someone  Like I said great start but wouldn't stay more than 2 years
good,"overall: good working places, work/life balance, have chances for new tech, nice managers. Top management have some bad decisions, bad with GE merger, bad with outsourcing/contractors."
good,"I started in April 1987 in the mail room, the company had just located from Ca. to Houston bringing all top Exs. It took some time to make sure I was doing the job they wanted me to do."
good,I started at the very bottom and was able to work my way up level by level.  Hard work and good work ethic were appreciated there.  Long hours are a custom but the compensation is generally fairly high for the hours put in.
good,"Worked for GE Oil & Gas for many years prior to the merger with Baker Hughes.  All the GE corporate leadership were replaced by self centered, aggressive industry types.  Became an unpleasant place to work."
good,"working in a very challenging and international environment as Project coordinator. During this time I've achieved a solid experience in Administration& Coordination role. "
good,"Enjoyed my role, however the job security was not secure being we could not secure a new project. "
good,"Excelente empresa, com grandes oportunidades de crescimento pessoal e profissional. Obtive muitos conhecimentos e aprendizagem, participei de varios treinamentos quanto segurança e meio ambiente."
good,"I spent almost 8 years working for Baker. In that time I transitioned into multiple roles. With each transition I took on more responsibilities with higher demands to meet extremely poor planned deadlines."
good,"Supportive colleagues"
good,"Baker Hughes es muy buena empresa, pero ha estado en re-estructuración en los últimos 8 años."
good,Have gotten to be more independent and plenty of opportunities and support to work in an environment like Baker Hughes.Friendly people and smart in what they do.The culture differences are matched even.y and in good spirit.It can be a little frustrating when you are not able to understand the language so you can communicate better but the nice part is people are patient and willing to take on the chance.
good,"Management is weak in merging and buying other business units."
good,Baker had a good work environment. When times were busy it was fun and challenging to work there. The management encouraged independent thinking and solutions oriented activities. Vacations were easy to schedule and Baker encourage it.
good,Ambiente de trabalho agradável e ótimos benefícios.
good,"we always got travel an seen new things and areas , and they were always on top of providing us with training and advancements with in the company. if you ever needed to speak to any management they were there and they would listen to any onions people have as far as the work place was concerns."
good,MFG plant was struggling to keep afloat and had big layoffs. Currently schedule to close the plant by the end of 2018. The benefits are good and management was supportive.
good,"Through my 10 years at Baker Hughes, management implement several paradigm shifts in how the business operated.  The first 5 years or so were great, but after that, it seemed to go downhill.  There was no rhyme or reason to how they did layoffs as far as who was let go.  It seemed as if there were letting go 2-5% of workforce it would come equally from each group instead of strategic planning to cut true fat and use this opportunity to move employees around for some cross training."
good,"Ambiente lavorativo stimolante, dinamico e formativo"
good,A typical shift would be around 12 hours per day on location and 8 hours on yard days.  While yard days can be boring they are necessary to get everything ready for next well or general cleaning around the shop and maintenance.
good,"Ótima empresa, bons beneficios, porém é muito difícil novas oportunidades e chances de crescimento o que acaba desmotivando o estagiário"
good,"Possibilité de mobilité au sein de l'entreprise locale, nationale et internationale."
good,"Great to work, oil and gas industry extremely slow, created workforce reduction."
good,"I think to work for any company , you have to love and believe of what you do . "
good,The work is great.  Most of the people are great.  They just switch managers up to much and their is no consistency. I have learned a great deal of the production side of the oil field.  I have been working around it for more than 20 years but this is defiantly more tailored to the west Texas area.
good,"Good place to work job friendly and"
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with my customers and co-workers. Management was average. Lots of politics. Enjoyed the perks that go along with sales. Typical day  was making at least 4 sales calls a day.
good,"the work environment is very organized and professional, with a developed health, safety and environment management system, they offer continuous trainings."
good,"focus on global strategies and execution."
good,"Challenging, every week something new to learn, programming , material, shortcuts to productive, management now will knowable to some jobs or machining. teamwork and helping each other. the hardest was looking for tooling to do the right job correctly and the most enjoyable was teamwork."
good,"Friendly co-workers ready to help and cooperate. Very tiresome number of meetings per day, some could be just resolved on a one on one call. i have really learned a lot in terms of Leadership, management and workplace and healthy environment culture."
good,"Good people, management decisions were questionable at times, very slow to hire people and procure equipment. Merger with GE did not go well, and frustrating at times. Will be good when things settle down."
good,"1.You can learn a lot from innovative people around you. "
good,"The job is sometime difficult and some time easy but it is a good plateform to learn different things,sallry is little bit ;ow due to oil crises but i hope in future it will be better."
good,Enjoyed my time at BHI and enjoyed the group of people that I worked with over the years. Enjoyed the work and had the opportunity to learn quite while there.
good,This is great company with ample opportunity. It is very large so it is easy to get lost within the company.  I gained of ton of valuable technical skills and was able to travel and learn how different parts of the business worked.
good,"Good experience of fast-pace competitive corporate work environment. Gathered knowledge in Oil & Gas, which is always a plus. Learned SAP and more advanced Excel skills."
good,"Company is a joy to work at. Has the tools and collaborative resources to get the job done. Work group is congenial, professional, experienced in the business and has the desire to deliver excellence for company. The organization is geared for a win."
good,"Funções exercidas: "
good,"Typical day of work started very early due to traffic, that usually took me one and a half hour from Home to work and almost two hours on the way back. Work day starts with Conference Calls that sometimes are 3 to 5 a day. Usual email responding and sometimes check the Workshop."
good,"Productive and great people to work with. When we clock in for the day, we have a short meeting to see who is present for work and the jobs or tasks we have for that day. Once you receive your job for the day, you will get started. If you have any questions, your lead will help you. I learn how to assemble the LMRP and the Lower Stack, I learn how to bore sight, I learn how to operate a crane, the scissor lift, man lift, and fork lift. I learned about the importance of safety and was voted as the Chairman of the Safety Committee, and I learned how to read the documents to assemble different parts of the LMRP and the Lower Stack. The hardest part of the job was finding the necessary equipment to do specific jobs. Management was brought in from outside the company which means they didn't know the job of an assembler. They knew leadership but they didn't know as much as they should know for that position. The most enjoyable part of the job is completing your mission, task, or job for that day."
good,"Excelente empresa, com ambiente desafiador e repleto de oportunidades."
good,"Everyone knew their job, when the product had to be shipped and worked well together. A person could not ask for more in such a big company with so many engineers and supervisors."
good,"GE has a great combination of businesses.  I was fortunate to work in several of them and I have to say that you can not rank or summarize GE as a whole because all companies operate a little different. "
good,I truly enjoyed working for Baker atlas and the people and management there.   They took good care of their employees and treated us all as family.   It was a company for the employees and they employees were for the company.  I still miss my Atlas days.
good,"Worked hard and played hard.  Great education programs.  Management was attentive but didn't follow through sometimes. Great workplace culture and the people are outstanding. Job wasn't difficult just very technical, and loved interacting with coworkers and customers."
good,Decent company with good pay and benefits. Averaged about 20-22 days on a rig. My coordinator was ok at getting things I needed and helping out. It was difficult to get promoted to the office. Too much nepotism.
good,"Culture is good; everyone help each other...this is a good team environment where problems are solved with team effort and collaboration."
good,"This was the best employer I've ever had. Very few complaints from me. My only complaint would be that management is not necessarily department oriented. So a financial management position could be held by someone with no finance experience. Same for IT, HR, and other departments. It can be very difficult to work for someone who has no idea how you perform your job."
good,"General Electric offer numerous advancement and careers . GE  has many sub companies , and acquisition businesses. GE offers virtual careers , flex time and the ability to work at a location close to your destination. "
good,"Empresa dinâmica e agradável para trabalhar."
good,Weinig vrije tijd gehad maar daarentegen veel ervaring opgedaan en veel geleerd over de off shore wereld.

good,"Start early complete tasks get off early,learning experience was great management was always ready to help with any problems,a very safe working culture, stop work was greatly enforced,the hardest part of the job was being productive in bad weather circumstances.The most enjoyable part was the sense of accomplishment from helping a customer figure out problems."
good,"Normal day consist of moving parts around"
good,"Great company to learn from and institute best practice and overall development - no matter the position.  Good systems, and, most importantly, good people / management running the company."
good,"If you are working as a direct hire employee, you get tons of benefits; however, GE does hire a lot of contract employees.  I took a position as a contract employee because it came at the right time and there are lots of employees who get hired direct by first being contract.  Unfortunately, GE does not have a lot of programs in my field of expertise and that is why I chose to leave."
good,"A typical day may include cutting cables, assembling potheads, hydro testing, and shipping.  the experience taught me how the oil industry supply works.  Management was there to assist in the work and to teach tips on increasing efficiency.  The hardest part of the job was the length of the shift.  The most enjoyable part was working with a great crew."
good,I was allowed to step up and get things done that weren't otherwise getting needed attention.  I was able to demonstrate my value and it was acknowledged.
good,"Excellent communication, interactive skills,redpondible,positive and team player,focused and performance oriented, quick learner with ability to adapt to new environment"
good,I love working for GE Oil & Gas. The hours are long but the benefits and compensation is great. If you're in production work is steady. Most work is done inside at this location.
good,"Good environment, good people not so good management. It was difficult with the lack of activity and they didn't care a lot about the people. Great people in there."
good,"BHI is a great place with great people to work with unless they are upper management, great benefits, pay and opportunities.  Management is destroying the company."
good,"Baker Hughes is an excellent, fast paced and technologically driven company.  Much of the time the work is very demanding but it is also very rewarding.  There is a lot of room for growth and personal development."
good,"very knowledgeable teams. family atmosphere, but only started advancing their internal policies and HR regulations after 2009. product lines are still separated in spirit, with minimal image exposure, except within the segment. management is not yet catching up with the HR, technical & top management & policy changes. promotions are rare and late. pay differs based on gender, ethnicity and nationality."
good,Baker Hughes was a great place to work with lots of opportunity for advancement. Located near Bush airport traffic was never an issue. Safety culture was backed by management and each employee.
good,Company gave us hours and tried to help as much as they could even in an economic downturn for the Oil and Gas industry. Overall I had a good time working with the company.
good,Baker is a great place to work with all the diversity they incorporate and the opportunity to advance and lead is one of the best.
good,"Enjoyed this work place.  Due to the Oil industry not being good now this position was eliminated but the opportunity I had here was good.  I enjoyed the people and the environment.  I was close to home so the commute was enjoyable,"
good,Had a good time working here and also willing to work here again anytime in the future. It is a company that really gets its employees ready for the future
good,Although management was not that great. We as supervisor had to keep moral up and keep the employees going. As we would fight for them and what was needed for the employees to conduct their job.
good,"good benifits, forget family life. lots of work stable good management severe lack of training, no organization. thats all no more. blah blah blah blah blah blahb"
good,"High expectations and payoff provides wonderful recognition.  Play hard but work hard.  I enjoyed the culture, benefits, employees, and teams."
good,"A GE, por ser uma das maiores empresas do mundo, atuando nas mais diversas áreas, oferece inúmeras oportunidades de aprendizado e, de crescimento tanto no lado profissional, quanto no pessoal."
good,"I would recommend this company to my friends and family. My typical day at work would be to load bulker with either sand or cement and drive to different locations throughout Alberta.  Complete the job on site and afterwards pack up all tools and equipment in a safe, orderly fashion."
good,"I had a wonderful experience working for BHI. But like so many, I am a product of the downturn. I've survived a few - this last one is one of the worst. Noting the caveat of the O&G industry, BHI is a dynamic environment that allows a motivated employee to advance."
good,Baker at one time was a great company to work for and I appreciate all the training and chances they have given me. I am not thrilled with the choices the upper level management is making.
good,Great place to work where everyone is helpful and were people trust you to do your job without micro-managing.  Company offers great benefits and work life balance
good,I would love to work with this company full time and get hired permanently. This particular plant is closing and will now be located in Jacksonville Florida.  This plant will no longer be union and will now be considered a non union plant.
good,"Great opportunities when organization was booming.  Training and work environment was bar none the best in the industry."
good,"Typical work days were fairly busy and rarely overwhelming.  The people you work with are great people.  Everyone was friendly and always willing to help which the most enjoyable part of the job.  Management underwent changes frequently which could lead to confusion at times.  The most frustrating part was having to wait to have things such as testing done.  This would lead to working over the weekend, and there were times when nothing was done with those hours.  I feel that comes with the industry however.  There was not much community outreach or events to bring the plant together and enjoy themselves.  Overall, this was a great place to work and I enjoyed my time there."
good,"great place to work at meet new people everyday, get to work on something different everyday. go to different locations as well"
good,"I loved working there gained a lot of knowledge "
good,My current company is dynamic and proactive to provide opportunity to progress within. Wide technical domain and supportive network to deliver core beliefs. The company always strives for innovative strategies that will drive the business forward.
good,"Great company to work for in the oil and gas industry.  Higher compensation can be found at other companies, but I have not seen another company treat their employees better than Baker Hughes."
good,"Baker Hughes provided an excellent atmosphere for creative contribution. There was innovation and excellent compensation making BHI an outstanding  employer. The oversupply of gas and reduced drilling activity took its toll on the employees. Baker Hughes initiated a series of work force reduction measures.spread out over two years.The promise of a Halliburton buyout, which never materialized, paralyzed many decisions to movie forward. Potential growth, even in a down market, was neutered. A pall of inertia fell over operations preventing the recapture of lost business, even as the DOJ reversed its position on a HAL-BHI merger.  It will be interesting to see how the company will perform with so much talent dismissed and so much dead wood retained."
good,BHI is a well managed and successful company.  I have enjoyed my time with the company and have had the pleasure of working with lots of clever and commited employees.
good,"Excelente Empresa Ótimo ambiente"

good,"Технико-технологический контроль строительства скважин. "
good,"Big and established company with presence all over the world. Offers pretty good compensation for Polish market, but it is still way less than in western Europe. Flexible working time, opportunities to travel worldwide."
good,"Overall good pay and benefits. As an EO when things are busy 100hrs/week are not uncommon depending on the location and crew you work with. Moved into the lab after my 3rd year with the company. Things were still pretty fast paced but not as many hours as in the field (60hrs). I worked mostly frac and cement. Frac is more planned but cement works with smaller crews and is easier for rig-ups. Work conditions are typical oilfield, heat, cold, rain, snow ect. Baker was good at providing necessary PPE including FR thermals & coveralls."
good,"Ambiente molto interessante per la internazionalità che si riesce ad acquisire"
good,With my job I always got to work with different people so I learned to work with a diverse crowd and have developed a lot of friendships along the way.  With Baker Hughes you are given all sorts of training that can help with all aspects of life.
good,"good company to work with.baker hughes provides its employees with safe environment to work. safety is their number priority, they make sure every employee go home safe."
good,"Great company to get lean manufacturing principles. One should focus on hitting the numbers and being a ""yes-man"" if you want to succeed in the traditional corporate culture. This is the case with any large global entity."
good,I enjoyed the people and working for the company. Would go back in a heart beat if they called me for work. Probably the best company I have worked for in the oil field. Had a lot of red tape to go through to get hired on. Took about a month and a half. After hired on things started to fall into place. Much expected I guess with any good company.
good,I have worked for Baker Hughes for 15+ years.  I enjoy the people that I work with along with the management.  They believe in giving you opportunities to better yourself.  They have a program that will reimburse you college tuition.
good,Great place to work always steady and working on your own was expected.People there were willing to help in most situations.
good,GE is a great company.  The industry(Oil &Gas) I currently work in is a downturn and is somewhat unstable.  There are too many uncertainties.

good,"while working as expat in this company I had a very good time."
good,"my time at BHI was a learning experience, with new views at management in a repair and rebuild setting. I learned a lot on time and labor management. our district manager did everything possible for our location even thru the down turn in the o&g industry. We had a great group of guys in the work force, we all looked out for each other on and off the job. the hardest part of the job was watching as my co-workers were laid off. and the most enjoyable was taking a machine down to the ground and build it back up with improvements and watch it come to life again."
good,"Get out in the field and stay out of the office if you go to work for Baker. Great pay, great benefits, and lots of opportunity to change jobs internally and travel."

good,"Over all the company and it's employees were were good people to work with. However, there is a lot of disorganization within the management structure. The hardest part of the job was getting reliable data out of the system.  The most enjoyable part of my job was accomplishing personal goals on a daily basis."
good,"Baker Hughes is an extremely large company, so it is very corporate in its structure.  It is very hard to move up and feel challenged on a daily basis. "

good,I got to learn a lot working with this company. The management was helpful in all ways. Overall i had good exposure and experience.

good,Baker me dio la oportunidad de aprender mucho y desarrollarme como profesional.
good,"Typical day very busy. "
good,I enjoyed working at BHI.  The best part about the job was the people I worked with and the technologies I learned about.  The hardest part was spreading myself across 5 divisions and the long hours required to complete all the responsibilities.  There were excellent opportunities to take advantage of my skills and to learn and develop in other areas.  Overall a good company to work for.
good,got layed off while in training with a lot of good people made some new friends while i was there. the training was good they where mostly about safety and getting the job done but making sure you got home as well

good,"A great company with opportunities to work globally. Very well regarded by oil companies and the staff are amongst the best in the world. Good graduate intake program with training provided at overseas locations."
good,"Baker Hughes is full of energetic and highly motivated people who oftentimes are required to work independently with limited guidance.  They are responsible for drilling wells and ensuring no one gets hurt while working around highly explosive natural gas and crude oil wells.  The work is very complex and I've found it exceptionally rewarding.  "
good,Baker Hughes is a company that both compensated and deals with their employees in a way superior to that of their competition.  But with that said it is still an oil field service company and as such is susceptible to will swings in business and job security.
good,"Mucha presión"
good,"Understaffed, long hours.. besides that it's a great company with wonderful people and products."
good,"I really enjoyed my time working for Baker Hughes. I regret resigning from this company to return to school, however I know it will be for the best in the long run."

good,"A top-tier oilfield service company with a century-long track record, Baker Hughes delivers solutions that help oil and gas operators make the most of their reservoirs."
good,Post aquisition business integration has been a great learning experience.
good,"The nature of our business never involved a typical day. Our customers relied on our family and team cohesive effort, in critical situations, to resolve many types of situations. The Field service team was truly a family which included our leadership team. We were available 24/7 with little backfill for rotation, which made for difficult family scheduling and quality time. I really enjoyed and thrived on the ""pressure cooker"" atmosphere and challenges."
good,"I enjoyed Baker Hughes. It is a very good company with great benefits. I had never worked in the oil and gas industry, so this was a very good learning experience for myself."
good,I work as hard as I can all day long until the job gets done.  It gets me through the day and a paycheck at the end of the pay period.  I miss home and would like to get back closer to it.
good,"•	Inter Personal communication skills"
good,"Baker Hughes is like a big family and they are good to their employees.  It is an interesting place to work with plenty  of opportunity for advancement.  Their benefits are good, the pay is good.  Good company to work for."
good,"A typical day at work includes working 12 hours while decoding information that is to be presented to clients at the end of the well. This realtime information is also used to accurately drill the well in order to optimize reservoir performance. Physical demands are minimal. I have learned how to program tools, troubleshoot software and surface gear, and how to decode data and present it in various forms. Management has some issues with communication between those in the field and the office. The hardest part of the job is the workload and job/life balance. Since a rotation has not yet been set in place, you are expected to be on call 24/7, work long hours for an undetermined amount of days and may not get many days off in between each well. An effort to fix this is being made at the moment. The most enjoyable part of the job is the comradery and family atmosphere."
good,"es una empresa como todas en espera de que el personal de el mayor rendimiento, asi como logra proporcionar las herramientas necesareas para un mejor trabajo, debido a su bajo indece de actividades no se lograron varios objetivos prometedores para el personal."

I loved my job and enjoyed teamworking with my cowokers since they where family on a 2 week/1 week rotation."
good,"Adquiri uma boa bagagem sobre a área comercial, não apenas com vendas, mas também em outros setores da empresa como operações comerciais, financeiro, supply chain, serviços.

good,"Employees there are very caring on your needs in the machining world. One of the best teams i have had the privileged to work with on 2nd shift. I learned many forms of threading, O.D and I.D. The 2nd shift supervisor is very informative when needed and if your doing your job, you will hardly ever see him, Great attitude.. Nothing to say to discredit Baker.. I really liked working there but needed day shift for kidos and finishing school at night."
good,"Excellent training programs with great pay and benefits."
good,"The day started off at 8 am and went till 5 pm just like a typical job nowadays, but the people were much more energetic than I expected. This allowed me to stay alert and enjoy working in the office which allowed me to be more productive. I learned to work with my hands because I got to be in the lab analysis tests on different products, as well as, create a design for my own product. Overall, I learned to be a well-rounded intern from understanding how others worked around me and took that knowledge to improve on my own skills. The best part of the job was getting to see how a hydraulic piston withstood 30,000 psi under temperature changes and getting to understand the different aspects of the design process that went into the prequel of that test."
good,"Provide customer with answers to well bore condition and direction. While navigating/drilling well bore according desired to well plan.

good,"Excellent core values, good people, good wages and benefits"
good,"A typical day was a 10-12 hour day on a Monday through Friday work week taking call one weekend a month. While working with Baker Hughes, I learned many new things about the oilfield and the different types of chemicals used. Management made the job worth while and the company one that I would love to work for. The position I was in was very independent and very rarely worked with a co worker. The best part of the job was not being restricted to one specific area every day. I was able to see different scenery every day."

good,Baker Hughes is a great company with lots of benefits.  If your looking for the American Dream this is a good place to help propel you.  I would recommend  anyone to work at an oilfield company.
good,"The company is good , they just need to be giving overtime, the Supervisor’s need to be fair amd they should stop playing games on the junior staff. Due to this behavior a lot of staff have been leaving the job"
good,My experience was good. Benefits are very good. The people I worked with were component and hard workers. Usually if there was a problem it would be worked out quickly.
good,Baker Hughes Inc. is a global oilfield company with great benefits but with the company downsizing there's hardly room for advancement. Great company to work for.
good,"Good company to work for , but like any other good company when work slows down , they  are gonna let you go. But overall a would recommend this company !!"
good,"Cleanliness, safety, quality, and customer satisfaction are the Baker Hughes commitment. 30 minutes daily safety meeting to ensure every employee get safe."

good,"Good company, management always made time for you. Lots of travel to different states. You were responsible for you own decisions, but always had support when you needed."

good,"I have nearly 20 years at GE.  Until recently I had nothing negative to say.  Regrettably, some bad decisions at the top are negatively affecting many who never failed to faithfully serve the company that is now cutting them."
good,Need a better forum to improve the workplace culture to give fair opportunities to all.  Better feedback on performance reviews.  When not excepted for a role accurate feedback as to why.
good,"Baker Hughes is like any other place, you have your good days and your bad. My overall experience was really good with BH. I worked with a great group of guys and women. Always willing to lend a hand and be a team. Management treated you about as well as an Oil and Gas company possibly could. The benefits were above average and the equipment you had to work with met expectations. It's Oil and Gas so your family life does struggle from time to time but overall I would have to say, well...I would go back in a heartbeat."
good,as for most energy jobs Baker has long hours and high expectations. Baker compensates very well across the board. A great long term option to have a successful career.
good,All projects were structured around team cooperation and safety. Working together and helping each other stay safe was a major cultural focus in the work lace.
good,Great work environment! Work/life balance isn't the best at times but I was in a finance role so that's to be expected. The company gives great perks too
good,"Baker Hughes is a very good company to work for because they have their fingers in so many different areas of the oil and gas industry. If you have a warrant to start your career in one area and transfer into different areas, this is a place for you. Pay is competitive and the benefits aren't bad either."
good,Even before the last round of cuts I worked on an R&D Team that was always under resourced and over tasked. Only the Hot Fires would get the focus and resources needed to fix the problems. This company needs to invest in R&D rather than cut if they intend to continue to be an industry leader.
good,"Receptionist Job Duties:"

good,Moved from engineering design to value improvement department manager. Over two hundred projects and reports on the log at any one time. Eight employees reporting to my office.

good,"Good place to work. Plenty of opportunities on engineering and digital.   "

good,Baker Hughes is a good company to work with . I always enjoy work with the company on different locations and with different people . We do logging services for the oil and gas fields company .
good,"Good atmosfere, but slow and lazy culture. Good benefits and the social life is quite good. Flexible times."
good,I had six different bosses over three years. It made it difficult to keep traction. Great employees! The people that work there are wonderful and the folks in my department were great too!
good,"The work at Baker Hughes was good, well paying and steady. However, there were several individuals that had never been in a position like that and would make the job more stressful than needed."
good,Steady paced chemical company. Decent equipment. Usually long days . Good benefits. Typical oilfield service company setbacks. When business falls must cutback. Manager are dedicated and understanding of life ups and downs. Most have started at the bottom and worked their way up through hard work and continued knowledge of field and duties.

good,"Good place to work. Good benefits. GE strives to be a leader in the Oil and Gas Industry, so they are always looking to expand and buy new businesses, This can cause a lot of turmoil when the business keeps getting reorganized. I have enjoyed my time at GE Oil and Gas, if you have worked for a large corporate company then you are aware of the challenges that exist."
good,"Good place to work in."
good,"Good job that pays good. Very hard work but plenty breaks. Sometimes had to drive to other locations after working more than 12 -18 hrs which was dangerous. Some supervisors wanted you to not stand around drinking water in hot oppressive 100 degree plus heat. Once available drinking water source(plastic bottles) were finished no one(supervisors) went out to get more despite temperatures. Most enjoyable free travel home and back,hotels ,benefits and pay. Worst part cold,rain very oppressive region."
good,As a fellow worker of the baker company working with energetic staff that also can enhance your energey to work a stressed out and empressive and ispirational
good,"Good place to work and learn new skills with plenty of veterans to guide you.  The command chain can be a little hard to follow as it seems to change often. Fast upward movement in leadership an management, not so much in supporting positions."

good,"Good Company with great benefits."
good,"Bake Hughes was an overall great place to work.  The culture made up for deficiencies in a clear plans from upper management and very unclear experience succession plans. The hardest part of the job sometimes not having the support of upper management to the job, however, with the help of mid-management, solutions were often found that gave you a new way to look at problems and sometimes better solutions.  At Baker Hughes, you learned to be a problem solver that utilized all resources available to achieve the best possible outcome for your customer.  The most enjoyable part of the job was all of the colleagues that became lifelong friends."
good,This is a good place to work to get experience but also gives pretty good compensation compared to the area it is in. The only downside is the rotating shift schedule.
good,I only had the chance to work with Baker Hughes for 6 Months but in that short time everyone made me feel like family. if it wasn't for the fall in oil prices i probably would still be there.
good,Coworkers are the best part of the job.  Baker has done a great job at hiring good people.  The management is becoming more challenging to deal with.  BHI is a great place to work.

good,Worked 12 hour shifts analyzing drilling cuttings and gas analysis as the oilwell is drilled. The work environment was very high risk as it involves offshore environment
good,"Report to briefing on job orders and hand overs."
good,"Baker Hughes a great company to work for, since they had excellent benefits, along with strong enforcement in compliance with  OSHA's standards. The salary was not the best , but the benefits made up for the remainder. Fun times at work were when safety meetings were conducted, along with a free meal. This organization gave me the opportunity to start my Health and safety career, since that is when I went back to school and pursue my Bachelors in Industrial safety. The only concern with Baker is that they don't hesitate to down-sized when the energy industry slows down."
good,"For the most part, the work came in heavy and fast for the engineers and draftsmen and other departments.  The management was easy to understand what was needed.  I liked my working for the manager of my department.  I learned that working with lots of different people can make for a small family environment.  The many locations was also a benefit."
good,"With the right manager, the work environment was very enjoyable.  Some of the upper management was incompetent.  Some directors were making decisions without consulting the direct manager of the employees affected."
good,Company is a good company over all. Management at the yard I work at desired tremendous improvement. Was more worried about linking their pockets with money than their employees theirself
good,Everyone know their job and was able to get thing done. It was not a lot of leadership that make the company great or more profitable.
good,"Je heb veel verantwoording en de gevolgen zijn erg groot, zowel in financiële opzicht als veiligheids opzicht en niet te vergeten reputatie"

good,"Daily updated Real-time pore pressure project. Completed reports for client and distributed them as directed. "
good,"Great people. You learn a lot and was a fun job. If you don't like getting dirty or working hard, long hours, this job is not for you. Perks are great. Get a work truck with paid gas. Corporate card pays for food and hotel when on job sites. Downside is the long hours (12 hour shifts) and these shifts could go even longer (up to 30 hours at times). Work schedule is somewhat reasonable (7 days on, 3/4 days off), but this varies by yard location."
good,I learned a lot at Baker Hughes and managed to increase my certifications and skills. They pursued my learning and I also worked my way up on one of the biggest deepwater drilling rig.
good,Baker Hughes was the best company for a new person in the Oilfield to train and gain experience. The work ethics within the company were very good. It was like working with a family.
good,"Customer support for 80 customers, building relationships to develop sales. "
good,"I enjoyed my 8 years at Baker-Hughes Artificial Lift, however after moving into a supervisor position I found they did a poor job of teaching me new skills. I wanted to learn more but they did not allow much cross training. However they did recognize hard work with financial benefits and I enjoyed most people I worked with. Lots of overtime available."
good,"All around a great company to work for. I learned a lot of leadership skills with my experience at Baker Hughes. Everyone is well trained and has an outstanding knowledge of their jobs. The company goes above and beyond to take care of it's employees."
good,"There were many good folks I worked with.  The benefits were good.  Job security was rough, but currently there is a bad market.  Upper management seems to be not in touch with the worker base."
good,"I really enjoying working here.  I work on the pressure pumping side and get treated great.  However, the unstable job market and long hours away from home creates quite a burden.  14 days on and then 7 off brings home a lot of hours, but i live in hotels."
good,"The company is great, the work/life balance is lacking specifically for the field personnel.  Management is friendly enough, but should have better communication with their employees."
good,"As Field Engineer, I used to work minimum of 13 - 14 hours per day handling measurements and logging operations while drilling and preparing the services ticket for the operations on a daily basis. In addition to that, I was in charge about the field inventory including assets that generate the revenue for the company."
good,"work culture and employees are fun here. we had a tough project at baker which was working during the night, after some time our work slowly shifted to day"
good,A typical day at work consisted of creating field tickets and/or invoices. File tickets and invoices. Code vendor invoices to submit to management for approval and payment. Keep office tidy. Order office supplies. The hardest part of the job was having to say good-bye to co-workers when I was laid off. Management and co-workers were easy to work with.
good,Great place to work. Co-workers are nice and easy to work with. Management however seems to not have the company's best interest in mind.
good,"- A typical day included either ripping apart dirty tooling that had returned from the fields. Or building new tooling to be sent out to the field for our customers. "
good,Living in the general area this job was fantastic.  Not living close to the drilling rigs was a long commute with long hours.
good,"I was enjoy working at GE OIL & GAS, we are together solve customer's request and support manufacturing about design issues."
good,The company has been laying engineers off because there price of oil is down and the orders for the company are down.  I am worried I will be laid off as well.

good,"Ver supportive management. Always willing to accommodate an employee for personal needs. Very interested in growth of their employees, but the diversity is not a strong point with this company.  I enjoy the teamwork atmosphere and the willingness to get involved in the community. I have been with the company for serval years and would highly recommend it to others!"
good,"BHI has excellent programs in place for technological innovation, regulatory compliance and personal advancement. Retention is a high priority for BHI as compared to the three largest competitors in its markets."
good,"Coming into work was a challenge that i accepted  and enjoyed. I enjoyed helping solving everyday problems to help my fellow team-member reach their daily schedule. Whether it would be vendor issues, warehouse mis-pulled,engineering, ect. By the time we got the material we had to react right away to fix the problem. It was nice having our own machine shop to push the material thru in a timely matter. In the mean time i could give my fellow team members temporary hardware to continue with fit up."
good,A typical day at work consists of loading up equipment at the shop based on the customers needs.  Ensuring all equipment is functional before leaving the shop.  You then complete the logging program which can take any where from 1 to 5 days.  You then submit customer deliverables and head back to the shop.  You inspect and clean the equipment and ensure the client has all of the data they requested.  The hardest part of the job tends to be the long hours away from home.  The most enjoyable part of the job is completing a meaningful challenging job with your crew and the feeling of accomplishment at the end of the job.
good,Several  opportunities for advancement and education. The company is world wide so if were willing to travel and or move the opportunities can be endless.
good,"A great place to work, safety is the number one thing for these people. They match up to 5%. Management is a little whacky with the Halliburton buy out."
good,Self motivation to get your work  done instead of being mandatory. A metrics company which doesn't necessarily give complete accurate picture of the employee. At the time I worked there unbeatable in it's benefits.
good,"Every day had a new order of business. Starts with safety is always first. Never a dull moment. Management, co-workers and clients could break up the day with  work such as  loading and unloading freight or just helping engineers get ready and loaded for their next job. We would help each other where and when we could to make jobs go faster and safely. Maintained  a water re-use system that greatly lowered expenses. Washing loggers, pick-up trucks and tools uses gallons of water that go through the re-use system and can be used over and over again.The water gets bad and is replaced after several week at a great cost. The cost for disposal is high but not having to change it out every week or two is a great savings for the company. Keeping up daily with company, state and federal safety regulations made for good inspections.(MSDS, HMSDS, OSHA, Fire Marshal and others) Drove a forklift to help in the loading and unloading of freight, moving pallet from one building to another and organizing the yard and facility. Kept everything clean and safe at all times making a considerable lowering of accident reports and saving management headaches. Didn't have to do much when the big wigs came in because we were ready every day. Well maybe just dust a bit."
good,In this position I spent most of my time working in an engineering lab where I would build test fixtures for PCB boards and perform several different tests in environmental test chambers.  All though many days were repetitive there were often times where new challenges would arise and I would have to think outside the box to come up with a solution.
good,"I worked there over 13 years. "
good,"I truly enjoyed working at GE NHR location. I learned a great deal about offshore that I had not known working in insurance for oil and gas. It gave a new perspective and allowed me to stretch my mental knowledge. "
good,"Maintain and drive company equipment to and from customers locations. Pump cement down customers well hole on their location to meet their specifations and needs. Every aspect of the job was done in trained safety manner. Learned to work safely with people around u and your customers. This job was a on call job so the hours were always differant, good and bad. Enjoyed working with differant people in all fazes of the job. Learned a great deal about the oil field all positive"
good,Good company to work for and advance with. Currently going through many changes and experiencing a significant downturn which creates a tough environment but management is taking steps to ensure viability moving forward. More uncertainty is being experienced as well with current merger activities.
good,family environment enjoyable part of the job working along side colleagues working out situations concerning rig situations and trouble shooting problems
good,Go out to location frac the wells and work on pumps. I learned to go through pumps work together as a team and learned how to run the line and also run the blender and forklift. Our supervisors where good leaders and took care of their crew. My co-workers got along with each other and would always help each other out when in need. The hardest part of the job is to stay cool when its hot and stay warm when its cold. the most enjoyable part of the job is the experience and the opportunity to make money and support my family.
good,I really enjoyed working with my Team.  I really liked camaraderie that I had with everyone at the Corporate office.  I found that everyone tried to work together to make Baker Hughes a good company to work for.
good,"Fast paced oilfield company with many calls and orders coming in everyday. Communication skills is key to operating a successful business. Very professional atmosphere, very organized and well managed. Friendly workplace it's like having a family away from home. Time scheduling would be the most challenging part of the job, there is no closing time in oilfield. If a customer calls with a demand the demand must be met regardless of any prior engagements. It is very lucrative and stable employment."
good,"Baker Hughes is a well structured  company, with a large experience in the oil and gas business. I learned how big companies work, I met great co-workers. The hardest part of my job was try to have every i field operations to follow the company policies in how to run Jobs  and also how you can use company tools to make the work easy.The most enjoyable part of my job was meet lots of field people with a lot of experience and traveling all over the world."

good,"Great place to work. They give you all the training you need and more. However a great deal of field work is required, generally more so as a newer employee, but is a necessary evil to get on the job experience. Benefits and pay are great, life/work balance not so much."

good,"GE is a great place to work, I have learned a lot about Oil and Gas products and the functionality. I enjoyed working with both of my direct managers and learned a lot from them. Helping my co-workers was the best part of my job, they were always eager to learn and equally eager to teach me about the business. The hardest part of my job was accommodating other countries with not enough time in the day."
good,"Baker Hughes, was a very difficult job the hours were 20 to 30 hour shifts  15 days on 6 days off it was also a fun job you really got to know the people you worked with, I liked it because i knew I was doing a job very few people could handle it was rated the 5th most dangerous job in the world, I would have stayed there if not for being laid off due to oil prices dropping I set some goals for my self, I wanted to become a red hat within 2 years and a treater withen 3 to 5 years but never got the chance."
good,"This is a good place, if you plan on making a career. You wont make any real money on cement, stick to frac. Its also pretty top heavy."
good,"Longevity its a possibility, if you keep your head down and don't make waves. They are safety conscious on paper, but not in practice."
good,The best part of the job is the new and exciting opportunities that come up daily.  I learned a great deal about management and various types of laboratory analyses and equipment.

The company's values are always in the interest of the Company's health, that in return support a fair and equitable place to work. There are no outrageous perks or pay programs for a few, and instead traditional, paternal programs that care for the greater benefit of all employees.

good,The up and down cycle of the energy market can be discouraging and take an emotional toll over time. Expect that it will be very busy at times and when the market is down learn to anticipate what is going to happen. Overall a good experience with a lot of training and development as well as dealing with a wide variety of people globally. You are required to wear many different hats as there are a lot of different priorities handed out from the organization which can be difficult to manage at times.

good,"We worked hard, in all kinds of weather, for days at a time sometimes but it was all rewarding because we worked as a team to complete the task.  The workers were all rough around the edges but that was part of what made it fun.  Was not the environment for everyone.  I learned that I could push myself to do more physical labor in harsher conditions than I ever thought possible"
good,"Great place to work and a lot of exposure to professional growth. Unfortunately they tend to promote only the trainee graduates."
good,"Good program if you want to get a foothold at GE in engineering and management. You need to be able to be self directed and take advantage of the opportunity as there's not many projects / duties set out. You can get exposure to an actual factory floor. No contact with the design process, all Lean and Six Sigma and improving efficiencies. Wasn't a fit for me and the summer dragged on."
good,"Baker Hughes has been good workplace where I spent almost 18 years and worked in many different countries gaining a lot of experience.  The company offers a good progression path and work-life balance.  Even though I was impacted by a reduction in force, I have no hard feelings because it was my time to move on and find new challenges."
good,Great place to work learned a lot & taught a lot. Upper management was supportive HR was great. Awesome benefits package would definitely recommend anyone to work here.
good,"12 hours working then 12 hours resting a day"
good,"Baker Hughes is a good Company in my opinion. Pay is competitive and job security is great, if you are not a slacker, of course. The larger companies like Baker GE (now) have a safety culture that is extensive and frustrating at times but you always know that it is for the best and beneficial in the long run."
good,"Great place to work, learn a lot from management team. Fast pace work environment but BIG on Safety of the Employees in office and  field techs. Great Communication on what is going on in the Business."

good,nice place to work   fair consideration on management  learning new skills everyday  family oriented culture    celebrations most enjoyable         trying to get everything done in a day
good,"I started as the receptionist then went into the billing office, where I trained 2 other girls under me with the intent to move ahead.  That never happened.  BH was a great starter company with great benefits, it was close to home and everyone loved me as much as I loved them, but I wanted more than to sit under a glass ceiling.  After 5 years, I left to work for a different oilfield company.  I have since kept in touch with all of my co-workers from BH.  They made me feel like family, and that was special."
good,"My time starts at 6:45 AM every morning. I check on the work load in the shop. Then I start to work on my paper work, and call from customers. Working for GE Oil & Gas is a learning experience. Everyday we learn something. What I dislike is showing too much favoritism, which in turn, allows employees to slack off on their job duties. I think the hardest part of my job is getting customers to respond to emails and phone calls. Also reversing and order because of a mistake, or giving a credit for over charging. The most enjoyable part of my job. The Holidays for sure, and cook outs when we do something good."
good,"I had a wonderful experience when I worked at General Electric. The people are nice and they are very helpful when you are having a problem. Everyday was nice, stress free, and quiet."
good,It was a good company to work for but there was a lack of advancement that caused me to leave. For the most part everyone that I worked with was friendly and the team made the job easy to do.
good,"Very good corporate culture,good place for work, good salary and benefits,a lot of overtime work, especially in a month end. Very great working experience ."
good,Was on call 24/7. Hard to have a family life.  They paid very well for the sacrifices needed to fulfill my job requirements . There benifits were the best I have ever had.

good,"Good place to work for, has its pros and cons."
good,"This company offers big challenges in a fast-paced, matrix environment where innovation and engagement are highly valued.   The Agile approach to “getting things done” is the predominant methodology.  Job mobility and progression is encouraged."
good,"Great salary & benefits, but starting to become less . The support & priority of good project management is hit or miss depending on the department and/or the direct management."
good,Buen ambiente laboral. Actualmente la organizacion esta pasando por una integracion (GE compro a BHI) es por esto que ultimamente hay mas cambios de lo normal.
good,excelente equilibrio vida laboral y personal. planes de carrera bastante robustos y salarios competitivos
good,Interested to join back if required. no matter where assignment will be given. Interested in onshore and offshore assignment but with proper rotation schedule.
good,"The benefits, hourly wage, insurance, stock options, and discount are just some of the perks available, when working at Baker Hughes. Some management lacked leadership, but I really am grateful in having a job there. The lack of consistency is the only major problem with the oil field."
good,Overall great experience working for Baker Hughes. Learned a lot and gained a lot of experience as an engineer. Work environment stressful at times due to the uncertainty job security due to oil market.
good,Ambiente agradável de trabalhar.Mas infelizmente não aproveita muito bem a mão de obra que a própria empresa treina.
good,"GE has a strong culture determined by the cultural pillars that put the customer at the center of what we do, both internal and external."
good,The company has since been bought out by General Electric. While I was there opportunities were always available for advancement. Unfortunately it is part of the oil and gas energy industry and furloughs are very prevalent due to market forces.
good,"Salary is great, unlimited vacation, training opportunities. However, health insurance benefits are below average. It's also very political - cut throat -- therefore management or sucking up to your bosses is equally important as doing your job."
good,"Aside from the stress of the unpredictable oil and gas industry, GE is an excellent company to work for. There are lots of opportunities for career advancement"
good,"The work culture of GE was highly ethical. It has a good work-life balance. There are opportunities for advancement. It's upto one, how he/she uses them."
good,A day with Baker Hughes was take chemicals to location safely and on time. Load and unload chemical truck. Pump chemicals in to chemicals tanks safely.
good,"no comments. I worked in GE as a contractor. focused on work everyday, didn't feel I was an employee there. No feeling about company but just think it is a big company."

good,"I'm part of the I&E group at the Pasadena location. Overall its a great place to work at. The pay and benefits is not the best compare  to other Chemical Plants in the area, but you can definitely reach 6 digits annually with all the overtime that its offer. The I&E group takes care of all the Instrumentation, analytical and some electrical inside the plan. The Instrument Manager is a great guy to work for, and the other technicians are very knowledgeable and easy to get along with."
good,"O segmento de Petróleo e Gás é novo para GE e , por esse motivo, a empresa não possui uma estrutura de plano de carreira como em outras multinacionais do setor, e como outros segmentos da própria GE."
good,A great company that offers global experience to those who seek opportunity and career advancement. Can be challenging with the high scedule demands but that comes with the territory.

good,"Great organization, good managers, quick decisions"
good,"Overall Baker is a good company but depending on the exact role there a different perks . In my role training was not that available compared with operations and field employees. Also they have a bonus scheme which is not 100% fair to all staff, some years half the office got a bonus while the others didn't depending on the internal grading system,."
good,Plenty to do.  There were always new skills to learn and sharpen.  There were plenty of guys there that were very knowledgeable about oil/gas.
good,"a safety abiding place to work, productive, large enterprise and business oriented. wages not bad, but few hours sometimes, geared towards or striving for excellence"
good,"A good place to work, where I could advance on my career. The management was very respectful and encouraged me to reach my goals. It was a diversified environment of different cultures. I had the opportunity to work with people from all over the world."
good,"The people at Baker Hughes are amazing however the leadership and good old boy mindset makes it difficult to accomplish strategic goals.  As such, Baker Hughes was not positioned well for market volatility negatively impacting it's people.  This is a management issue."
good,Baker Hughes was a great company to work for.  I'd still be there if it weren't for the lay offs due to the crash in the oil/gas industry
good,"always busy trying to stay on schedule and learn a diffrent type of equipment. also management was excelent with all employees and had a great group of co workers, the hardest part of the job was during winter extreme weather conditions but got through it and the most i enjoyed was the group of people that work we me and made my job a lot easier."

good,Both BHI and NOV internships were very beneficial for gaining real world experience to link back to skills learned in the classroom.  Support was given to ensure that questions were answered fully and input was valued towards solving problems on projects.
good,"Baker Hughes was a great place to work, and paid well. Daily work life was filled with hard work and long hours. Management did a good job making sure we weren't over worked. They made sure we had everything we need to get our jobs done in a safe and timely manner. Baker Hughes took pride in their safety record, and never made anyone do anything that could get someone seriously hurt or killed. Advancement within the company was difficult. You had to be patient as higher level positions were almost impossible to obtain unless someone quit or retired. Although the job paid quite well, it came at a price. You'd spend 9 months away from home a year, and only 3 months at home. There wasn't much time to be spend at home with family. The Oil and Gas industry depends heavily on the market. So job security can be a problem if the market isn't doing so well."
good,Excellent place to work and growth as an employee. Baker Hughes is a good place to work. Very mature corporate culture and great people to work with. It gives you a belonging of being a part of Baker Hughes Family.

I have picked up computer skills in this time , i,m no expert but once shown how to complete a task and doing it several times i surprised myself at times. I like to think i got on well with my co-workers never a cross word with any of them , and there was a happy healthy atmosphere in our office . Hardest part of the job was trying to meet impossible deadlines due to a change in how we used to hire in 3rd party equipment, being used to lifting a phone and arranging same or next day collection was replaced by and ordering system which made the same process take several days . I enjoyed most when everything came right when required so OTD,s were met .Sadly due to restructuring in the company my position was made redundant , but overall i had a good time"

good,"Started as Junior Field Engineer and tagged along with Operators to learn the basics and the hard labour before progressing as Field Engineer. Underwent many trainings and learned many types of services. Had a good team working on the job planning, test, mobilization and execution. Good career development program with proper guidance.

good,"I really liked working at BHI.  The dip in oil prices were not conducive to great successes in the oil and gas service industry.  Had there not been a downturn in our market, I would have stayed with the company."
good,"Employees entered the work building with fresh smiling ready-to-work faces.  I  learned about  different job functions within HR  Service Center and I learned about different employee roles at Baker Hughes.   Management listened to our comments, including our concerns. They regularly kept us informed on the organization's vision, so that we could have focus to help meet those goals.  Our feedback was important to the managers working to meet our career and personal needs. A set of diverse personalities from different demographic backgrounds allowed me to work with some of the best co-workers. I also developed long-lasting friendships.

good,"I joined Baker Hughes straight out college because of the people and the work environment I had experienced in Anaco, I had tremendous support from my mentors and peers and I quickly became one of the best field service engineer in east Venezuela and in my first 6 years I went on to successfully carry out over 400 well completion operations in the main completion product segments that we had in east Venezuela.  "

In particular my extensive background in Information Technology and Real Time systems have been a tremendous breakthrough to deliver project on time and solution for the final customer."
good,"Great  People, in depth training and opportunities for a strong career in the oil industry. It was great working environment and mentors that lead you to achieve you goals."
good,"Great job but with the downturn with the oil prices it took a told on the branches overall outcome."
good,This a great company to work for. Besides the layoffs I would say I had no problem working for this company.. I would highly recommend them.
good,When oil prices are up the hours are long and the money is great. When oil prices are low hours are short and money isn't great. Great people to work with.

good,Good Company. Had a great time working there. I was exposed to a lot of opportunity for growth. I would work there again if the opportunity presented itself.
good,"Productive work environment with many opportunities for Learning and Development ."
good,"Good company that treats it's workers very well (even when the market is low). Coming from a 20 year military background, the hardest part of any job is trying to cope with how slow, entitled and undisciplined some workers can be. Also, Baker Hughes Incorporated conducts way too many meetings. Many meetings could be emails but that method of thinking comes from the top down. The most enjoyable parts of my day were being able to assist the technicians on the floor with trouble shooting problems, giving recommendations for repairs/reworks, saving the company millions of dollars annually and providing a good reliable product/service."
good,"Baker Hughes was the best job experience I've ever had, my superiors were always there when you needed them at any time . A typical day at work consisted of traveling to a work location assembled my tools contacted the company man , held a safety meeting before every project. co-workers were excellent communicators and very reliable."
good,"was a good job but lacked true leadership due too so many managers,and supervisors you would be asked for a task and have 5 different conclusions that they would like to see that never matched up. learned how to provide good customer service. and to operate many forms of heavy machinery."
good,"Before hiring on with BJ Services (later Baker Hughes), I had not had much of a 'Career'. With the training and wonderful management over the years, what started out as a way to make some good money turned into a wonderful career. I was provided with wonderful leadership and educational knowledge that I am now able to apply to aspects of my personal life as well as my professional life. Every job has it's pros and cons. With my career at BHI the pros vastly outweighed the cons. I was disappointed that my time with the company was cut short due to the market conditions, but I understand that it was a business decision. I look forward to working with companies that are the same caliber as BHI was."
good,"good company to work for...good pay, good hours. would recommend to a friend. management very friendly and easy to deal with"
good,"A great place to gain workplace experience. Coworkers were very friendly and the majority of the management was hands-off and friendly. There were some management issues, such as not listening to input from coworkers and having an personal agenda that took precedence over the good of the department."
good,Sales position is a great way to network with others.  There are numerous opportunities to interact with customers.  The employees are eager to work with you in order to accomplish tasks as a team.

good,"A typical day at work includes inventory management, quality control, and customer relations."
good,Fun work place with supportive management. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.
good,"My workload consisted of my core research and modelling activity and tasks that I shared with my team. The main benefit for me was improving my skills in quant analysis algorithms and applications. Communication with management were pretty much horizontal and hand reach. I was a normal practice to share the results of your work with co-workers even if they were not deeply involved into it, but could give a fresh look and remarks. The hardest part of the job was rehearsing presentation speech for many times and the most enjoyable part was delivering this presentation without a hitch."
good,Would still be at Baker Hughes if they were not bought out and massive layoffs.  WE were allowed overtime.  Made some great friends.
good,"The whole time with this company was always learning new things. Was able to get my Class 1 license, numerous other needed training classes to complete my work safely."
good,"Baker was a good company to work for. One thing that really spoke to me during my time there was the fact that some of my friends would leave for a few months but then they'd come back and into a higher position. From what I've seen, Baker had some of the best benefits available to their employees. I enjoyed the variety of people that I met and conversed with."
good,Best part of the job was high paced work. I learned how to build mud motors and use programs to track parts used on the motors. The hardest part of the job was not being appreciated for the work we did
good,"Baker Hughes is currently ( 2015 ) having to cut back from the drop in oil prices, however is still a leader in it's industry. I had the privilege of starting work here without any prior experience. The management takes good care of employees that show effort in wanting to learn and progress. Overall a wonderful spring board for my career and a honor to learn all that I did there."
good,"Until I got laid off. But when HR in the big office is just looking at numbers and not merit, you will get the short end of the stick. Good place to learn though."
good,this is a very firm company until the downturn of the oil business. very considerate of its employees with very good befits to all.
good,Professional management and staff. It was a good 14 year experience handling the procurement and taking care of the complete logistics warehousing and Inventory. SAP was a great system to work on.

good,"There are days that sometimes start out at 2 or 3 in the morning on any given day of the week, including weekends and holidays, and will generally run up to 18 hours on an average day. This is not a job that is for those that expect easy work or hours that would reflect a bankers schedule. The climate is one that usually will not agree with your preference, but it is a position that select few will be able to handle. The environment can be hot and dry on some days and cold and wet on others with loud noise constantly from every direction. Although there are times that become overwhelming and stressful the connection with other co-workers becomes deeply rooted into a family type atmosphere that you could not find any other job that is rewarding by the end of the day."
good,"Discipline in time. Each task should be done in scheduled to avoid stack of work."
good,"Supportive management and good team work,all other functions are very well supportive, new learnings and new challanges on every day and i am happy to be with the team."
good,"I am very proactive in my jobs. I end up a day at work by noting down the list of  items that I have to take care of the next day.  Next day morning starts with going through all the list and prioritizing the work to be completed. At the same time, checking on the mailbox for all the new jobs . Working in such an environment has made me a multi tasker to cope up with the challenging jobs."

good,Most of the time you could get supervisors to help with a problem. Operating and maintaining high pressure pumps and other equipment offshore was a normal day.

good,"Company is over all good to work for, good over time, health insurance is good, 401K is excellent, but the company is always trying to low ball the employees on the salary, the salary is to low so they can make you or force you to work the overtime so you can make a good pay check, by far this is the company where I work the most for the less money."
good,"Baker Hughes hired me straight out of college... it was my first real job.  I quickly learned the responsibilities of the job from a guy who, I guess you could say, mentored me.  The Company has a great program for their Field Engineers that facilitates their progression, and with that comes the opportunity to move up, engage new challenges and make more money.  It's a win-win situation."

good,"Maintaining a relationship with operators and those who require continual training to meet regulatory requirements. Develop new training material, conduct training classes, coordinate with vendors for training need, maintain and meet yearly training budget, maintain training records for auditing and records retention requirements. The most difficult part is working with multiple shifts to ensure they meet all necessary training requirements, while maintain current production levels."

good,The work environment is challenging and fun.  The people really make the company in this instance.  The managers are easy to work with and genuinely have the employee's best interest in mind.  The work groups I've been a part of were inclusive and easy to assimilate with. The drive is to always be improving and strive to deliver the best results to customers.

good,Effective and efficient office atmosphere. Good management. Healthy schedule. Good benefits.
good,"On my latest job as an electronics technician at Baker Hughes. I started with second shift for almost a year, before I move to first shift. Typical day at work when we first coming in the second shift. I discussed with coworkers on the previous shift about what they have been working on and do they have any problem during the assembly or testing. What do they need me to finish testing the tool or work on the new tool. I also check with manager about what is a priority tool for that day and when is a deadline to ship to the warehouse. I will receive the job request from manager and start to assembly and test the tool or help my coworkers if they need to assist them to complete their task. The hardest part of the job is predicting when the product will be completed, before all the test is done. The most enjoy part is completed your task assignment before the time and have enough time to help out my coworkers to complete their task assignment at the end of the shift."

I learned how to rebuild high pressure fracturing pumps and what hydraulic fracturing was all about. Management was fantastic however the coworkers were a little off, tended to be rude and uninterested in training new hires.

The best part of the work day was picking up the liner hanger and rigging down the casing crew. From that point on all we had to do is get to bottom. We knew the hanger would not fail and it never did. Knowing that makes the job a bit easier.
good,"Your experiences at BH greatly depends on your manager.  Guys 10 feet away have completely different work life than myself.  Always busy, hard deadlines, and just trying to catch Halliburton and SLB.  Big company but feels like we are treading water just keeping our nose above water."
good,"They were high on the golden rule ""safety first"". Great benefits and good pay. Worked at a good pace and mainly by myself and learned more about the gas oil companies and materials.

good,Our project was so difficult and challenging. The training I received was one of the best in the country. It has made me safer at home and has also made me focus on the solutions to problems that are faced by everyday production

good,"I enjoyed my job at Baker Hughes. The Oil & Gas industry is very unstable, so I was laid-off during the downturn, but I really enjoyed my time at the company. My only negative opinion of Baker Hughes would have to be that the company does not promote within. The likelihood for career advancement is very low. To be promoted, you pretty much have to leave the company and come back."
good,The organization promoted whilst providing consistent challenges to improve knowledge and bottom line.  The cross functional teams allowed for a team oriented atmosphere.
good,"Huge factory. Lots of personnel. Bad management and horrible engineering mistakes. This factory is more worried about hurting someones feelings then getting the job done. They baby you here. Everyone is quick to run to HR. Hardly anyone cares or takes pride in doing their job but that's ok because there's no accountability here.No consequences or repercussions. And the decisions that are made, are made to benefit one certain individual without the whole factory in mind. They care a lot about safety which is good, however people use that as an excuse to get out of work. And the production rate is darn near next to zero.They only care about how good you TALK about doing your job but not actually doing it."

It was very tough work with long hours away from home, but was very rewarding with what I learned. I was compensated very well for my time both in experience and pay.

Sadly Baker itself is un-loyal to its employees.  If there is any reason they can find to terminate they do.  They really don't want to pay out for older employees. They are defiantly more interested in making a buck for their bottom line then taking care of employees.

good,"A typical day is very busy, I often start at 7.40 in the morning and finish at 5.30/6.00 in the evening. Fortunately, each day is different and there is not a way to bore yourself. In general I am busy because I have a lot of meetings to do, e-mails to reply or conference call. However, I'm free to schedule my daily activities and to reserve part of my time to attempt courses. In relation to my colleagues and management, during my employment in GE I was lucky. In fact, my colleagues and my manager are always available and ready to help me. In general, what I found difficult is the change."
good,"Excelente empresa, cultura a frente de outras, boa oportunidade para desenvolvimento profissional"
good,"A baker hughes é uma empresa que eu sempre admirei e sempre irei admirar, uma empresa de grande porte que valoriza o funcionário, foi um enorme satisfação ter tido a oportunidade de fazer parte dessa empresa!"
good,"I worked for Baker Hughes for 18 years. It was a fast paced environment. I truly enjoyed my time there. But, as it is a oilfield dependent company, when the oilfield is slow, the office is slow."
good,A typical day at work includes going into the shop if not on a job. Learning from individuals have been doing the job for a long time makes it easier to make developments in each and every individuals career.
good,"Good Company to work for, salary is good. Good working environment. Lack leadership in upper management.Family atmosphere and good employees overall"
good,"Wonderful place for work. Even though, life balance with work is hard to maintain, but the people are so nice and the management is more than good."
good,"The biggest advantage is the liberal culture that allows you to work on flexible hours. The work pressure and deliverables are however is so tight that one cannot manage without flexible hours. The management is supportive and able. The company is not a pay master, but there is a lot to learn and experience with GE. Definitely a must in ones resume."
good,"I loved working at Baker Hughes I learned so much and got to experience working for different Product Lines within the organization.

good,"Tive a oportunidade de começar minha carreira profissional na Baker Hughes e também de me desenvolver ao longo dos anos."
good,"En general considero que es una buena empresa para trabajar,pero el tiempo que demanda para poder desarrollarse y mantenerse es muy alto."
good,"Time is money and in the oilfield this is with out a doubt the truth.  One mistake can causing millions of dollars to fix.  You must think quickly and be correct.  This job tests your memory, multitasking skills, and most importantly your troubleshooting skills.  This is where the fun begins.  You must seek the root cause of the problem and fix it. If you want to work the most high profile jobs, you must excel in all areas of the job."
good,A good place to work. I do not understand why this is necessary. This kind of work is a 24/7 on call work that is difficult to explain if you do not know what the work is.
good,"productive work good pay and benefits great team to work with only down side is work is slow when oil prices fall, build motor leads, work 36 hours one week and 46 the next"
good,"My job was to build packers and plugs. It was a job that depended heavily on the oilfield. I enjoyed training new associates and teaching safety and going by guidelines and rules set for us by the company. The hardest part of the job was working for the company so many hours that I really did not have much of a home life. In addition, to be laid off after serving 20 years of employment to the company. It hurt to be disregarded like that. The best part of the job was the ability to provide good customer service and complete orders received."
good,A good place for a days work with lunch brakes and a healthy environment. Given hours are moveable and days needed for health care.

good,"Empresa que fornece todo a infraestrutura de mão de obra e ferramentas necessárias para desempenho  de função e grau de responsabilidade na  mesma proporção, que é muito bom,pois determina o quanto você pode colocar em pratica todo o seu conhecimento. O lado ruim,é que a mudança de Cio quase que a cada 6 meses,faz com que as filosofias e responsáveis mudem ou percam seus empregos."
good,I have had a good experience thus far.  There is plenty of training available and company benefits are good
good,Work in Congo from 8am to 6 pm sometimes later.
good,"excellent values and internal culture always focus on customer services focus, total quality managment, process improvement, total quality and great training programs for employees."

good,I reviewed work orders everyday & reviewed manufacturing variances on monthly basic & worked with manufacturing managers & Operations managers to resolve them
good,"Great Employer, would love to work there again... "
good,Working with BHI is a bit tough due to the nature of the business but its also fun and interesting at the same time. Everyday is like a new challenge but the team is very supportive that makes new challenges easier to conquer.

good,"Relaxed workplace, great team spirit and collaboration from crew and management, Pressure pumping has a dedicated manager always there for his guys. Heavy lifting during rig up and down of equipment."
good,"One of the last places you can still bust you butt to succeed. After a  few years in, advancement opportunities start to thin out unfortunately. Oilfield pay is still above average industry-wise so that helps."
good,"I was contract with GE and would have loved to stay there longer. They are structured, follow their own rules, and do not overwork you. I was very comfortable there. My manager was great, and very intelligent."
good,"Great company to work for with plenty of room for advancement. The company continually trains and re-certifies its employees, keeping up to date with the latest training and certifications"
good,"Empresa boa para trabalhar, salarios e beneficios muito bons."
good,"While the company was great and culture was great, some of the management team needs help knowing how to work with different types of people. Sometimes to be able to work with all types of people you have to change your approach. Especially in a large company like GE."
good,"I appreciated Baker Hughes, Incorporated for their appreciation for the employees contribution to the bottom line. Decent benefits.  I enjoyed the free lunch provided to employees at the Navigation Facility."
good,Baker Hughes management system is so complex due to the fact that the Corporate itself is composed of several subsidiaries.Our Division suffered a consequences when world crude oil price dropped significantly to a disappointing level that oil drilling development went to a standstill for few years.
good,"I worked on oil drilling locations both offshore and onshore.  Either alone or with another person, I rigged up equipment around the drilling rig with cables to my trailer (2-4 hours).  This took place as needed regardless of the time of day.  Tools had to be measured and plugged into after rigging up computers in the trailer (4-6 hrs).  Once operational, the shift work was 12-hrs, roughly 6AM-6PM and vice versa.  A typical job lasted 1 1/2-3 weeks.  Time off between jobs varied and was only set by vacation."
good,"I enjoyed what I did at this job. There was overtime when I needed it, but it was not something I felt I had to do to keep my job. I felt the pay was just where it needed to be."
good,"I enjoyed my time as an equipment operator while there,,the yard I worked in closed in 2014 due to oil right count was down so closed yard I've always wanted to find another job similar to that,,maybe not a 21/7 rotation but 15/6 would be just fine."
good,People that use to work there made the difference.
good,I felt that my role at GE was very fulfilling and rewarding. I feel that the engineering team was very well structure and collaborative when working on the tasks at hand. I felt that management would always look out for the best interest of the employee and make sure their workload was now overwhelming. Overall I found GE to be a great company to work for.
good,"Can be extremely busy at times, creating an imbalance in a work/home life. But overall a very lucrative career. Lots of opportunities to learn and advance in your career."

good,"Excelente corporación empresarial, buen ambiente de trabajo en las locaciones o sucursales (divisiones operacionales) donde labore."
good,I was over a very large account and was look to double it. The company met with BHI and told them they need to hire a couple more people to help me. After 6 more months I still didn't have the help so BHI lost the account.
good,"Meu sonho era trabalhar com vocês e Tive esse privilégio, uma visão e tecnologia gigantesca a empresa Baker tem. Aconteceu a crise e infelizmente com o nosso país, e fui demitido devido os cortes de custo,enfim ... mais a empresa foi sempre uma aliada dos seus funcionários. . Se algum dia eu estiver a oportunidade de voltar a trabalhar na Baker, serei muito grato.. Obrigado"

good,I loved working for this company.  I enjoyed what I did and who I worked with.  The management was a little rough since they had little time as managers.

good,"Boa gestão de RH."

Lots of ""lifers"" and people who had left and come back to the company. Great availability of training and knowledgeable people who were willing to help."
good,"Starting, heading to the yard, crew getting ready for the convoy to the job site. Location set up, rigging up iron, equipment's set up. Team work, communication and hot coffee."
good,"Cutting edge technology in the down-hole instrumentation field- exposure to technically complex systems, often to component level, and exposure to physical concepts underlying measurements."

good,"Work 8-10 Hours a day"
good,"Direct counterparts couldn't be better"
good,"Bons benefícios, gerência acessível e respeitam na medida do possível a carga horária dos trabalhadores."
good,"Great learning experience for anyone interested in working in the plants. The work load varies from day to day, depending on what needs to be done. Some days can be very stressful, but other days the work load is quite light. I learned too many skills to list. I had mostly great co-workers, but my management was amazing. I felt really taken care of. The hardest part of the job is being called unexpectedly for a long, arduous process. The worst part of the job is being on call at all times. But, most of the time the job isn't too demanding and the autonomy was great."
good,Baker Hughes was pretty enjoyable and educational. I had the advantage of being in a small office with close coworkers. Unfortunately was laid off due to low oil prices.
good,"Safe place to work with advancement opportunities.  Managers are always willing to help, and leas by example.  Baker has a great safery culture ."
good,"Work starts with a team meeting in the morning to go over the tasks at hand for the day and what assignments or reviews need to be completed. There is a lot of support from co-workers  and management. Hardest part of the job for me was having to deal with difficult people, but thorough training, i have become very knowledgeable in doing so."
good,Worst decision in selling the company to HalliBurton. Other than that the management was good and the training and development of employees was good
good,"Every company has it's ups and downs, but I have to say that Baker Hughes is the best company I've worked for. Hands down. My co-workers and I built bonds that made us seem like family and that meant always looking out for the safety of one another. Management, at times, was questionable but I learned to just follow instructions to my full potential and share my opinion if the opportunity arose. The hardest part of the job I'd say were the long days and nights (12 hours at minimum) but it was all worth it to ensure things were getting done the right way. Not to mention, the paychecks kept me happy too!"
good,"Great people and and great product"
good,"day to day job document submission and collecting from various clients, depositing company checks in bank, payment of dewa and etisalat bills and submission of visa documents in various embassies etc."
good,"Me encanto trabajar en baker,me permitio relacionarme con gente de otras empresas,como asi tambien aprender lo que se refiere a la recepcion, ya que me desempeñe como recepcionista de la empresa."
good,"I had moved to Texas with no job lined up and Baker gave me a shot and i'm thankful for that. I enjoyed the one's and two's type of work, working with engineers on tooling and the sort. I didn't have to deal with production because we were a prototype shop."
good,Good work/ life balance with excellent investment on people training and good management. I enjoy the team building activities.
good,I enjoyed working for Baker Hughes for the past two years. I formed a bond with my crew members and they felt like family. We worked long hours and were away from our family more than we were at home. I will miss working in the oilfield for this company. They were an excellent company to work for.
good,Great company to work for and have many friends there. The hardest part of the job is not seeing your kids for long periods of time. The most enjoyable part of the job is satisfaction the job was done correctly and safely and everyone gets home to their families.

good,"Muito boa, aprendi bastante."
good,"This was the best company I've ever worked for and plan on getting back with GE in the future."
good,Clock in half hour before shift to be briefed.  Relieve attending dispatcher.  Clean work area after signing on to computer.  Learned that any thing could go wrong or right just from a phone call.  Be prepared for anything.  Management were all very professional.  My co-workers knew how to roll with the punches.  The hardest part of the job was not knowing when something was going to go wrong.  The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing after the end of shift no matter what happened I handled the situations professionally and efficiently to the best of my training.
good,"My experience with Baker Hughes was overall good. Hard work and dedication really allows you to succeed in the work environment. Training is self sustained, if you are smart enough to pick up on things fairly easily you are set. Politics is minimal in shop area, thats basically what won me over in the beginning. After working hard and proving my worth I applied to another area (Desk job). I immediately regret the decision, apparently my experience with the shop and good nature with the guys on the floor were intimidating to other employees. There are a lot of good people at Baker Hughes, just be careful who you work with."
good,"The company was really a joyful experience and my role as a former MWD was awesome. The culture of a MWD was set around a drilling operations environment. A average day in the life of an MWD consumes of 12 hr days and working mainly in from of a computer and office type setting. The first and last days of a job assignment might be the most physical labor a engineer might undergo, but making sure the tool is functioning properly and collecting the proper data is summing up the basis of the MWD experience. Sending emails to company personnel  happens though out the day and always working as a team with the other service companies is something that part of the job."
good,Good company to work for but as a field service employee be prepared to work 24/7 but the pay is outstanding. Good people to work around at the shops and all are very willing to help. Management needs a lot of improvement. It's do as I say not as I do.

good,"Baker Hughes is a large company.  As in all large companies, there are areas of the company that are excellent because of the management in that area.  There are also areas that are not as satisfying to work in, also due to the management of that area.  Overall, Baker Hughes is a great company to work for, from my perspective and experience."
good,"Operate company vehicle"

good,"Great relaxed place. Fast pace but easy to keep up with although people needed more training and system had bugs in it. Way too many managers but most were good people.

good,"My duties were to facilitate the paperwork, help with inventory updates and locations, and help with the shipping and receiving of drilling equipment.  I learned SAP, various drilling equipment, and safety guidelines. Baker Hughes is VERY safety oriented. Being my second full time job and being 3rd shift was difficult to get used to, my body eventually grew accustomed to the different work hours. The most enjoyable were the guys I worked with and the drivers were characters!"
good,"I really liked working for Baker Hughes.  Unfortunately, the company pulled out of the Kenai Peninsula completely.  I have kept friends who still work for the company in Texas.  I do like the culture and how easy moving up in the company was for someone with ambition."

good,everyone at the shop to the field hands were very helpful and polite. There was a sense of family because as a field hand you were gone for a month or longer to complete a tour. Pay was awesome but being away from not so.

I had the opportunity to learn all facets of the health and safety industry through training and on the job or on hands training.  We were awarded after having competitions between crews for the best safety record.  The management was very supportive both on the crew and upper management.  One of the hardest jobs was working with the crew because of the language and culture barrier.  They were very hard workers and I had a good repor with them. The hardest part is being away from family.  The company itself was good about your family and taking off to be with them.   The most enjoyable part is learning all the different things the company does and seeing new parts of the country.

Company however doesn't allow movement throughout company until after 36 months from your start date. It is possible however but it needs managers approval. This is only possible if they can find some one that can replace your current job role. I have gone to school and wanted to move within the company but was blocked from movement twice because of the production output I have which is excellent. Instead I was given a raise and not allowed to move which has become frustrating as I am trying to branch out and start on my new career path."

Por parte de los colegas las mayoria se distinguia por la disponibilidad del trabajo en equipo, habiendo diversidad en cuanto a Habilidades de cada uno de ellos, de tal manera que el coordinador ordenaba la cuadrilla para cubrir con las habilidades de cada uno y hacer un equipo mas solido. La parte mas dificil del trabajo fue el tiempo que se ausentaba uno de su casa y estar en Mar abierto por casi 30 o mas dias. Lo que mas me gusto fue el crecimiento Profesional, el conocimiento Obtenido, los viajes para conocer diversas culturas y regiones que a su vez favorecio para aprender conocmientos de otros compañeros que conocian la zona, al tener diversidad de paises de procedencia del trabajo practique mucho el idioma extranjero y aprendiendo la conviviencia dia a dia con compañeros de trabajo.

If we all listen to each other the knowledge improves.  The hardest part of my experience with Baker Hughes was watching the high tides and the low tides of the business and how it affects employees.   The oil industry rides the tides of the governments needs.  When you work for a corporation your time is with the employees more than the time spent with your own family, so to see them come and go was difficult.

The pay was what you would expect in oil and gas.  Work/life balance in a field position was nonexistent, however, that is to be expected.  The corporate environment provided excellent work/life balance if you knew your job and did it well.  Unfortunately, the market dictates headcount, and we are on a major downturn.  It's also unfortunate that Halliburton has acquired this historic namesake that invented the drill bit."

good,"The employees were all easy to get along with and were very helpful.  the company had a safety conscious culture. The job life balance was somewhat unstable but that seems to be part of working with any oil company considering call-outs and the like. Having to deal with technical difficulties when having to meet deadlines was usually the hardest part of the job; management and supervisors were able to help most of the time since they had previous experience in the shop. There were always chances to advance in position and pay, the supervisors were always pushing the employees to do their training and advance as well. Safety was always a first, even if it meant an important job had to be delayed. Management was always trying to be involved, as well as the supervisors, in order to try and understand the individual needs of the employees and the shop. Job security is the same as with any oil company; it is hard to define. The benefits and pay were good and there were always plenty of incentive to be gained."

good,"I was brand new to the oil field I've heard of the hard work that comes with being in the field but I can honestly say I haven't experienced it myself. I started out as a LWD/MWD field specialist II which was fine with me because the money was great and I wasn't responsible if anything was to go wrong. Rig up and down was left to my lead and the DD's as was all of the paper work. If issues were to arise on my shift I would simply wake him up and if you were lucky enough you'd have issues pretty late at night and he'd normally just take over then and there and you'd have a couple extra hours off of work. Following a bunch of rigs being laid down lay offs begin and I was quickly promoted to level III when my lead was laid off now I have more responsibilities which are easily passed along to others as fears if being let go are still there if my night hands don't want to listen. I have to say I'm still learning new things about my job everyday but from seeing what happens when things slow down the most important thing I've learned is make sure you make friends with the right people in the office. When layoffs began I was sure I would be one of the first, there were so many people that knew every aspect of there duties and sacrificed so much being in the field as much as they were. But I learned that was their mistake while they were out on location I was in the office hanging out, going out to lunch with Corrdinators. I'm still here and their not and I got a promotion out of it. I guess it helps to make friends. Good luck on the job hunt everyone."
