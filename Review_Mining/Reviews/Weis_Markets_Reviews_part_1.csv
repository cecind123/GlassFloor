rating,review
bad,This company does not care about their employees in the least bit. They don't pay a liveable wage and have trash benefits. Just don't work here at all
bad,"Don’t waste your time thoughts effort just don’t. Immaturity all around, gossip,harassment of all kinds from “managers” biased, run around conversations,FT employees who do less work than PT, no morals no standards no respect for people racist jokes belittling degrading again from management, no teamwork. Every reason not to work for a company you can think of it’s a pitiful joke, honestly."
bad,If I would have known how this company treated their employees I would have never taken a position there. When I was hired the management was much better then what it is now.
bad,"Weis is a very stressful job to fulfill, especially for young adults. Costumers are very disrespectful. Breaks are very short, not enough time to take a bathroom break."
bad,Out of all the grocery stores they pay the least and expect the most work out of you compared to other grocery stores. Don’t waste your time there. Apply your self somewhere else.
bad,"The managers never have a plan really for anything, no one trains right. Managers leave with out telling you where they go just in case you need there help"
bad,"They start out nice being very polite to you but even though you don’t take time off, they still screw you in the end and make you go to Other department and then you lose hours very rude management."
bad,Honestly I don’t think you’ll find worse management than that weis stores I was at. Never work there. You will regret every moment of you working there and I can promise you that.
bad,This company is a failure from start to finish. Management is a joke they don't know what they are doing. Or if it would make sense to do Something  they would do the dumbest things possible. The hard worker will only be take advantage of never rewarded. Everyone can do whatever they want to. They try to enforce things for one day but usually forget and nobody listens.  They hire atleast 10 people every week for the last three years that just show how many people stay. Do yourself a favor and dont work here.
bad,"The only good thing about working in the deli is meeting the coworkers they are all pretty nice. The management sucks, they yell at you and don't even tell you what you did wrong."
bad,No life balance. Poor management from top to bottom. Take time away from part time to full time witch takes forever to get your vacation time back no flex days
bad,if you think it would be better than McDonald's to work for no it's not ive worked at McDonald's and at least they gave you more than a 10 cent raise sometimes McDonald's would even give a dollar raise. Managers would harass there employs at weis. They would find any reason to fire you. They would try to get me to close multiple departments which would have been a 4 person job by my self
bad,When I was hired by this company they had a happy family atmosphere. They have had several management changes since then that make the work environment impossible to succeed in. I cam in an hour early and left at least an hour late every day unpaid to get the unreasonable work load done for management. That effort was not only not recognized but was punished. Its a miserable place to work.
bad,"No career in the business. Managers suck, all they do is walk around and do nothing. Told by management that everyone is replaceable. Don’t apply here"
bad,"I found nothing enjoyable about working at Weis.  Unfriendly coworkers who are resentful and bitter. Customer complaints about thickness of lunchmeat and cheese!  Complaints regarding cake decorations!  Couldn’t wait to find a better, less degrading job. Management did not back up employees, they were always looking to blame associates."
bad,Management was circus. The job consisted of mostly drama queens and issues between coworkers. People got yelled at daily and there is no need for that in any place. Workers felt unsafe and harassed as well.
bad,Store Managers need better training in customer and employee skills. Human resources needs improvement in when employee's call with concern's or complaints and ask not to use there names because of fear for retaliation they need to listen. A lot going on with Upper Marlboro store and to much to report but just bottom line is that I would not recommend employment with Weis.
bad,"When asking management questions on how to do your job better they reply ""figure it out"". They lie to protect there own jobs, cut everyones hours so the full timers are running on empty doing multiple jobs in there department. The disrespect is flat out sad that in 2019 people who are deaperate for work are even allowing this to go on. They tell you if theres an issue to come talk to them, but all thet do is give you the run around."
bad,"A typical day a Weis market consist of long hours and constant demand on the employees."
bad,"Pay was awful, and pretty sure there was nepotism and sexism. I had applied for stocker and got manipulated into being a cashier because I'm female and another employee's SON got that job instead. Horrible management. I once was yelled at because I had to use the bathroom and turned my cashier lane light off when I had no one in my line."
bad,Weis is awful. I would never ever suggest working here. Management is awful. Pay sucks. The manager doesn’t care about their employees at all. Don’t work at weis.
bad,"	Planned daily staff time and activity schedules to ensure all tasks completed in an efficient and timely manner."
bad,"The management are rude and biased, you will not be compensated fairly in any way. You will be screamed at for not doing things that are not remotely close to your job, and the raise policy is so vague and changes so often you never really know how much or if you’ll receive a raise or what the raise will be based on."
bad,"the managers there are not professional. they don’t care about their workers mental health, they don’t do proper training. they help you out when you ask but don’t check up regularly to make sure everything is going well."
bad,"I do believe that I am overworked and not appropriately compensated for what I do at my job.  I understand that my position is one that pays the minimum wage according to the law, but the expectations and demands placed by management are contrary to the job description as described in the corporate handbook and other materials.  "
bad,Seems I care more about how the store looks and runs than many managers. They are constantly having trouble with the pharm tech schedule because they refuse to hire a full-time tech.
bad,The worst in a retail position. dishonest people lazy managers.          dirty store and restrooms no thing stocked like bread milk and eggs. Just a sad misersable place.
bad,Managed by a know it all tyrant. Doesnt care about his employees. On orientation talks about the time he used to bring a baseball bat in to work. The entire night crew quit because of this manager. I'd apply anywhere else first. Not here!
bad,"Overworked, underpaid.  High turnover.  Not the type of job that pays well enough to provide a living.  You will have to work on every holiday, even if you request off ahead of time, they may approve it, then schedule you when the holiday arrives."
bad,"This is by far the worst place to ever work at. No one cares about you all the way from the people you work with to managers to corporate. Managers are inconsistent they cannot be on the same page and they are terrible at doing their job. They only care about themselves and not about your well being. The pay is trash and you won’t get a raise for months and when you do it’s only .05 cents. They try not to give you breaks, terrible company. Save yourself."
bad,"I would never recommend working here. The pay is awful compared to what they want you to do. the customers were rude and awful. I had zero paid time off, zero sick days and was scared to even ask for a day off."
bad,"I did not get many hours while working there when I was always available. I did not get paid as much as I would have thought, the only benefit of working there was the discounts"
bad,This was a very negotive experience for me I will never work at another Weis ever again. You'll get get negative people everywhere you go. I've dealt with a lot of negative people in my life but this place seems to be the most draining place it's very cliquey and poorly managed. I was not trained properly the only reason I have ever stayed as long as I did with this company is because I had allot of retail experience in my life not a great place for beginners! I remember my first day the front end manager didn't even want to train me like didn't even acknowledge that's how this place is I don't know if it's this particular Weis all I know is that I was not properly trained. I had to learn stuff within 8 months of working there on my own. I remember they had me train somebody and I'm not even a manager and she did better within a week than I did on my first day. When I first started this Weis it was good because I had my old manager and then we got this new manager and then things started going downhill the whole work environment changed.
bad,"Worked in produce for 8 months. My coworkers were lovely and made the job a bit more bearable. I worked the night shift, leaving me drained but unable to sleep once I got home. Essentially I'd have about 2 or so hours to do daily tasks once I had woken up the next day, meaning all I did was think about Weis. "
bad,"Weis Markets don't care about its associates. There is too much drama going on with the high school kids. Managers are way too friendly with associates, taking smoke breaks together, gossiping about people. Lack of communication between everyone."
bad,"The employees are treated unfairly, I was hired under the pretense that my hours would be changed to coincide with my childrens work schedule. They refused. The deli manager did not know how to order stock or create schedules on a consistent basis."
bad,There are no pros to working here. This place will suck your life from you. I hate it will all of my heart. I literally want to kill myself every minute that I am here.
bad,The management at weis  was very unprofessional. . They were just very  and unorganized. DO NOT WORK HERE. There are way better opportunities. Dont!!!
bad,"I wouldnt recommend anybody to work for this company. Providing excellent customer service was top priority. Productivity was high. Always a fast pace work environment. Some management went above and beyond, while the corporate level of management are high strung on their positions and arent too friendly, and dont recognize thier good employees."
bad,Managment is a total joke. They dont have a policy they stick to. The people that actually work get no recognition but the ones that dont get promoted.
bad,The front end management of Weis was based heavily on personal opinions of the manager and assistant manager making promotions very hard to obtain without arguing and demanding to be given a fair shot
bad,"The managers treat there employees like garbage. The corporate office could care less. They treat the employees like they are stupid  and will not listen to anything we have to say. They make the deli workers clean the bathrooms.  The managers scream at you in front of customers. They are degrading, hurtful, and just plain mean. They make you feel like you are worthless.  The managers are the laziest people."
bad,I was dept manager that made the company$ every quarter and was stuck driving 42 miles each way for work. I was asked to do so for 6 months so I agreed and 3 years later I was still driving 42 miles to work !! They lied to me on several occasions about going back to my original store . My advice to anyone getting job with Weis Markets is to get EVERYTHING they tell you in writing.
bad,I worked for the company for 3 months and I was promoted to a assistant store manager. I was in that position for 4 year and the company promoted me to a store manager. 6 months later I was terminated for an unethical behavior such as taking an item that was giving to me by a vendor. Multiple people have done this before how they are really biased.
bad,Management is irresponsible and inconsistent with their promises as well as their job roles.  Associates aren't treated properly.  Not allowed to have water with them while working and there are a lot of forgotten breaks.
bad,Don't expect to ever get full time employment or even a steady work schedule unless you are management. No benefits offered not much of paycheck either.
bad,"Really awful management, disgusting food quality, awful discounts. The job itself was ok, but the customers are all rude and didn't give a care about anyone even when it was all their fault."
bad,produce clerk. I enjoy my job I like what I do. I get along with everyone in  my department. The pay is awful. As a part time employee there is no benefits. Have to be there 2 years to get a vacation. No sick days if there is a death in the family you do not get paid for time off. should get a raise on your year anniversary but if the minium raise went up you don't get that anniversary raise. I wouldn't recommend to company to anyone looking for a job. It's a pay check until I find something else. Poor place to work
bad,Flexible schedule but for career advancement is a joke you can put in years of employment and they will pick someone that’s barely worked here and don’t know wht they are doing to be a manager
bad,"stressfull environment and manager was arrogant and cant help staff at work if they had problem only asking u to work and work."
bad,"Lot of work for little pay and barely any hours, management sucks. would not recommend to anyone. Typical workday includes: being bounced around to every department that needs help and then screamed at for not getting your work done."
bad,"This place was an awful place to work. I genuinely liked how there was always something for me to do and I wasn't just standing around, but sometimes it was taken to the extreme. 90% of the time my department manager was missing or she would leave a couple hours early. The department was connected to two other departments and we weren't allowed to tell customers we couldn't help them even if we were swamped in our department. The entire place is very for themselves and could really care less about you as a person."
bad,"people made it so bad to work there. managers had favorites so if you weren't liked by them you had to do so much more work than them, they would make us stay late all the time and let other people go home early."
bad,"Weis is a great company with a great history but the current pharmacy management no longer provides that kind of culture. They often leave their employees understaffed, over worked, and under compensated."
bad,"Anyone who sees this, do not work for this company. They do not pay well enough. Their benefits really suck. You do not get any sick days at all. Just a bad company to work for."
bad,"Low Wages, took 6months to get a raise that come with new position and it wasn't retro to the day promoted.  they say they promote from with in but they don't.  they had qualified people for positions and hired from outside before posting the position as available"
bad,Did not like being harassed by the most recent manager. I did not enjoy my time their especially when this manager came to the store. Terrible work environment. Never had enough people working.
bad,"stressful , did not give you the hours you said you could work but instead all the hours you said you could not . not fair when it comes to calling off due to events in life you have no control over . just all bad"
bad,"I worked there for 4 years progressing rapidly, front end to the pharmacy as a tech. they didn't train me. I trained myself and passed the exam. Hours were limited, policy prevails over common sense. They play favorites and preach of excellent customer service but that is only a rouse. I didn't get the pay rate I earned after getting certified for over a year with no backpay. I would never have wasted my time for a company so petty and callus. I was let go due to numerous petty violations that complied into my undoing after I was sick and called out legitimately, having doctors notes and met with lack of empathy for being a single mother who was unable to get or afford a sitter."
bad,"They ask for everything to be done in a certain time and do not pay enough for  the amount of work they ask for. If you do not meet there standards, they give you one day a week."
bad,"bad experience, constantly asked to do more than possible. bad management low pay. would not work there again. constant battles with the store manager."
bad,Poor communication and managing of time on job. Almost always expected to do more than humanly possible and often told you don't do enough while on the job. Very bad habits promoted by managers and lack of cleaning throughout the stores. Would not recommend unless in need of a decent paying job.
bad,a typical day at weis is sometimes slow but busy.. what I learned was a lot more patience ... the management team is ok not great the assistant managers are great but he head manager has it in for certain people and will find fault with everything and before questioning something they should look at the camera over head o and f the register and see before assuming things . they will fire someoene before really knowing all facts or explanation..th hardest part of the job really is none.. the most enjoyable is getting to know people and great co workers
bad,They are unfair and discriminate. I was treated like trash and worked until my legs fell off. I worked so hard only to make no money and have my hours cut and changed constantly. NEVER WORK HERE
bad,Management team is not in sync with each other. As well they don't have enough associates on the floor helping customers. Extremely short staffed at night not enough to help out with packing out the products.
bad,Manager was absolutely horrible and immature. I was doing the work of two people multiple times a week working register as well as price adjustment. I was busting my behind for over 29 hours a week and he would not give me a raise. I was only getting $9 and hour for the work i was doing. The woman who I worked with was doing the same exact job I was and she was making more than $15 an hour. Ridiculous.
bad,employess are underpaid and undervalued. customers are always right even when they are wrong. there's no real chance of advancement unless you are already in a higher postion.
bad,"My shifts normally started at 6 a.m. and I left between the hours of 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. I came in and took many shift reports from the day before and recorded data to begin the current day. I worked in the cash office and in the customer service associate area. My manager was not able to help me when I had concerns or issues that were out of my control. In fact, my manager sometimes asked me for help with her work. My coworkers did not respect time and many times I waited about 30 minutes for the key holder to open the store up. Many times I stayed an hour or two after my scheduled shift ended in order to make up for someone else's lack of respect for time and others."
bad,i did not like working there was treated unfairly i worked harder then other at my job i accepted another position elsewhere where i knew i could fit in
bad,"Awful leadership, no communication, and poor associate moral. Slim to no breaks and no one to cover shifts when needed It was a very stressfull situation"
bad,The management did not care at all for their employees. Schedules were always mixed up. It's just a terrible place to work. I regret staying for as long as I did.
bad,"Management didn't care about issues that employees had, no advancement opportunities, very little hours and they would continuously hire new comers while still only giving maybe 10 hours a week to those who have worked there."
bad,"there is nothing good to say about weis terrible management, weis had the lowest morale of any place I have ever worked before. staff doesn't follow proper procedure when rotating food."
bad,"The management is immature & doesn't treat you like a human."
bad,I worked at Weis during my senior year in high school. During this time I also had another job. The managers at Weis were not very understanding of my availability and this lack of flexibility caused me to leave this position.
bad,Other employees were very rude to you if you were new. They did not care if you had an family emergency or anything. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the employees. The customers were amazing and loved working as a cashier but the other employees and management were rediculous
bad,"I was hired in Meat Dept. Started out with $9hr. Was told at my interview would get a raise in 30 days. Once I saw after being there 2 mos and no raise, was transferred to cashier. They cut hours, hire more people, and expect you to be happy and productive. I have over 25 yrs customer service skills, and refused to take my joy. Who can be happy at a job making $125 a week, less than that sometimes? You ask managers who don't seem to care. As of today, 4-21-2017, I just got a new job. I can't afford to shop there, and my heart goes out to my co-workers who are still struggling. It's just not fair."
bad,"They do not appreciate their employees, they take you for granted and you feel very unappreciated. Hours were good and the hours were very flexible. I enjoyed working here besides the bigger people don't appreciate their employees."
bad,"Doesn't allow you to take a break during a 12 hour shift"
bad,"Bottom line, just for a weekly paycheck and temporary job fine, grit and bear it but dont stay long, they dont care about employees, you will figure that out quick."
bad,"This is an overall negative review for Dallas Weis, if you need a temporary weekly paycheck go for it but dont count on it being anything close to the Company claims on how well they treat thier employees. Some co-workers are nice and then some are demon spawn, Weis is just another greedy food chain that puts profits before people, ignoring good performance, stressing out the few loyal employees that have actually stuck it out for a length of time, use them for a paycheck then dump them."
bad,This job was not one of my favorite places to be.  It was very slow moving and there was not many things for you as an employee to do.  I was a cashier and between customers they did not give you any other responsibilities which made it a very long day.
bad,"They reeeeeeeeeally don't care about employees. Work here if you don't have a life or family or bills. As far as deli work goes it depends on your coworkers and supervisors. Take the closing shift its way more fun and less stress super chill "
bad,"I really enjoyed working for this company,It was very hard work. I learned a lot about working with the public and with other coworkers.We had a lot of fun times and memories."
bad,"Toxic work environment, very poor management. They don't pay enough and this causes people to quit, they then expect the people who haven't quit to work double the amount for the same pay."
bad,"I love working Deli, but Weis Market was my worst experience in my life. The co-workers are dramatic teenagers, even the adults act like kids. Nobody works, so I had to pick up the slack for 3 people. Some of the 'workers' would take an hour break when it's supposed to be 15 minutes. I would not recommend working at Weis Market."
bad,"A lot of drama in the work environment, management is not management material, and scheduling can be a horrible disaster most of the time."
bad,"ok if its your first job  "
bad,"WEIS markets didn't care about anyone, not even the customer...I worked there for 8 yrs and busted my butt for NOTHING, not one manager ever noticed that I only took off one day in 8 yrs, walked 2 miles to work everyday, worked shifts that were available and late night when call outs, my knowledge to the products, my outstanding customer service, knowledge of products we sold far surpassed our own deli managers knowledge, I had outstanding respect and dedication to every single customer and associate, I trained for 9 months for a higher position, knowing that our deli manager at carbondale pa Weis markets never promotes ANYONE in fear of her job security.  That position was given to the least deserving of the position over my outstanding knowledge and seniority, it was given to a slacker with over 15 no calls/no shows and when I got upset at their decision, or the lack of concern when left to work 2 departments alone in order for the cheap company to save on hours instead of calling in anyone to help out, they short staffed their dept to not care about overworking their workers.  When I spoke up about it...then they stripped me from my department and put me on the registers, to punish me.  It was an 8 yr nightmare of idiocy and disrespect."
bad,"Poor pay with plenty of work required in one shift, high demands of job, sometimes have to do more than one department.Store Managers can care less about any employees.Customers are not always first priority but they do like to claim that.Not enough employees to satisfy customers needs in time. Sometimes you have to work all day if someone calls off and sometimes you are by yourself waiting on a huge crowd of people they do not call anyone to come in because they are to cheap."
bad,"A typical day at Weis is not knowing who will be in charge and what they will have you do .  I have learned  nothing at this job.  Management only cares about there own job and not the employees it hires. Most of my co-workers are great, some are not so great. The hardest part of this job is  going to it . If I said there was an enjoyable part of this job then I would be lying ."
bad,"Never work here unless you are 16 and its your first job!  A typical day at work would be, people calling off, being short handed and having to try completing not only your tasks but tasks of others that have called off.  Management is terrible and won't lift a finger to help you, let alone communicate with you about anything other than negative incites.  Vacation is terrible and limited to certain times of the year with many blackout dates.  Work weeks for managers is 50-60 hrs and holidays more.  You get yelled at if you call off sick or forbid a family member passes.  They want the best employee they can get for minimum wage and treating them horribly.  Advancement is almost impossible because if you show talent getting paid at a low amount they will not promote you because they will have to spend more money.  The most enjoyable part about this job was being able to talk with customers and meeting new people.  Never work here unless you are 16 and its your first job."
bad,"Not alot of pay for the amount of work required.  Schedule always changes, thus poor work/life balance for those raising a family.  High turnover rate with poor job training, although some people are definitely helpful and kind.  Another plus is making a difference in a customer's or employee's life by either encouraging, listening or serving them.  However, it is difficult to advance to other positions, for it seems there is alot of competition and for little pay.  Very demanding, so be prepared to deal with a high volume of customers, which can be very tiresome, especially for the wrong person.  Only seems worthwhile if advancement and higher paying opportunities were to become available."
bad,"A usual work day at Weis Markets was never one to look forward to in any way. They don't pay you enough for they work they want you to do and if you show them that you adapt fast and are able to muli-task you are in trouble. They have no respect for their workers. I got into a car accident on my way to work and had to call out because I couldn't make it in time. My manager did not ask me was I ok but instead said,""OK, whatever make this your last call-out."" That was my first time calling out and he put me down as a no call no show."
bad,"I could not give any stars to rate this company. I have never worked somewhere that did care about their employes, not even the smallest bit. Everything that was told to me in my interview were lies. This is a company that cannot be trusted. They take some many short cuts so they can maintain their billion dollar status. This company will jerk you around. You can play by the rules and do all that is asked of you. But will not get anywhere with this company. As long as I worked there I have never heard anyone say anything good about the company or even felt good about working there. It's a stressful for no reason. I am very surpised that someone hasn't filed a complaint with the department of labor. It is shady under handed things going on with this place. Only take a job from this company if there nothing else to take, just know what you are getting into and keep looking for another job."
bad,"Never knew which department I was going to be in"
bad,No matter what this place is the worst place to work for. Hands down!
bad,These people not only care about themselves but the pay is bad and they cut your hours. If there is nothing to do they make you do the job again. They have no corp values and just care about themselves.
bad,"Working at Giants Foods was alot of fun , the co-workers were very friendly and helped alot when i first started working. I held a postion as a cashier and the only thing i disliked was rude custmers but i kept a smile on my face the best part of being a cashier was you meet someone new everyday and your people skills get better"
bad,"I worked as a Seafood Manager for a year. It was the worst job ever and not because of the work, but because of the managers. They liked to talk down to you and belittle you. I've worked many jobs before and never have I been treated in this manner. They were rude and disrespectful. The work wasn't bad, and my coworkers were friendly,and the work was consistent. So...if you need this job go into it knowing that you'll be treated poorly by the management."
bad,"The management is horrible, the hours are long and grueling, and the customers can be very rude/unkind. The company as a whole does not care about it's employees and they do not listen to employee complaints and the pay also greatly lacks. I worked there for 6 years and worked in almost every department within the store at some point or another and I only got 1 (mandatory) raise. In addition, the managers like to play games and they will ""punish you"" by cutting your hours. This is completely unacceptable! I work two jobs full-time and I am also a full-time student, I have bills to pay and I don't have time for their stupid petty games. What a joke of a company! I have irreversible damage to my back and hips from working there and having to constantly lift heavy items. Weis Markets is a horrible place to work!"
bad,"I would never recommend to anyone. I've been working in management for 6+ years and never had such a poor work environment. You could tell the staff and upper management were not trained properly. There is no communication between dept. managers and store managers. I never got treated so poorly until I started working for Weis markets. The store manager would communicate so horrible; it was like he wanted everyone to know he was in control. He would walk away in mid-sentence, no eye contact and to make matters worse he belittled you, was not professional, and criticized everything you did. I would recommend working for Giant or Wegman’s."
bad,I would not recommend any person to work at this place. There is nothing positive coming from Weis Markets other than a steady paycheck.
bad,I would check people out and pack thier groceeries. I liked working with the public btu i did not like the hours i was given.
bad,I didn't care for the job.I learned retail. I got along well with the employees and customers.It was impossible to get ahead and they wouldn't hire full time even though I all but worked full time hours.
bad,"I just quit the Muncy Weis bakery this past Saturday night as a cake decorator/donut maker. i was also suppose to be trained into baking but that never happened because of how short handed we were. They had me working 37hrs a week getting paid $7.40 an hr. So I dont know where they are getting these working and paying figures from....A lady that I worked with, her last day was tuesday. she worked with the company for 10 years and she was getting paid just over $8 an hour....and for everything they make you do, its not worth it. and their benefits suck!!"
bad,always cutting employee hours and pay was only minimum wage and never gave any raises
bad,"They have there favorites and because of that the person who does there job and comes in unless a health emergency gets written up for poor attendance, when each time they have a doctor's note for the employees absence."
bad,The management in the store was very unprofessional.  They would talk poorly about employees and would never attempt to motivate them.  Communication was also terrible.  You would be told if you had an issue you could call them on their days off to get help but when you did they never answered leaving you stranded.  It was always so stressful and you never felt like you were doing a good enough job in the company.  The pay was horrible.  If you were an assistant manager in a department youd get paid less than the manager doing the exact same job as you.
bad,"Very Very low pay for all that is required of you .Dress code horrible uniforms are not comfortable should be jeans and "
bad,When I first started working with Weis there was plenty of hours but over the years there was less and less hours. They do not train you properly. They are very parcel to certain employees and employees that deserve recognition don't get it and the one's who shouldn't get recognized get it.
bad,"Nepotism is strong in this store. Management is a mess, moving up is nonexistent and being trained for a position is a hilarious concept. You can be a good employee and be extremely sick from something that a workplace injury caused and they'll still give you grief for being sick. You can't win either, come in sick and get called useless. Call out and be punished."
bad,"Very hectic, stressful work environment, expect too much to get done from too light of a staff, does not pay well, I got a dime raise in two years time. Have to wait two years until you receive any vacation time."
bad,"Weis is a money hungry grocery chain. They could care less about its employees, part time or full time, and they sure do often times. They play favorites and if youre not related to someone or ""in"" regardless of experience or skill, you're not moving anywhere. Management is rude, lazy and knows nothing other than minimal tasks to make them seem like they contribute. The lack of proper staffing and workload distribution is awful, too. All around, its an extremely bad place to work, even as a first job, PT. Don't do it."
bad,"The company clearly values profits over it's employees. Corporate is consistently raising expectations of management without providing additional labor to complete additional tasks. They are staying open longer on holidays each year, showing that they value their employees and their families less than making money. The overall morale of the employees has lowered considerably over the last decade in my experience in multiple stores and positions,"
bad,"The pharmacy is filled with busy work, nothing is automated so you do get a feel for what pharmacy was like about 20 years ago. Despite this fact, pharmacy technicians are not valued. Most Weis pharmacists do not value the technicians either, despite the fact that they do the leg work and about 90% of the work. I have been fortunate to have one pharmacist that values me for my work and does not send me home. Due to being part-time, you have no true health insurance. What the company offers will only pay $50 towards a office visit and only bad doctors are covered on it. I work the maximum amount of hours that I can as part time and have been denied full time employment for over a year despite my excellent performance being recognized by the pharmacists boss. I obtained my national certification as a pharmacy technician in hopes the pay would get better but you cap out at $12 an hour, which is a lot less than other pharmacies in the area. My pharmacist and her boss has been petitioning for me to get full-time but management keeps denying it for over a year now, which is why I have left this company. "
bad,"You will be thrown into departments with little/no training. Also, you will be expected to run more than one department at once by yourself when things get busy or there are call offs, good luck getting any help."
bad,In short summation  I would NOT recommend Weis Markets as a company to seek employment with. No job security or benefits . No paid vacation time unless employed by Weis Markets for a period of five years. *
bad,"Management is a joke. Big time favoritism at this store. Big time retaliation for saying anything. Coworkers are back stabbers, nasty and mean. Some management divulge personal info to other regular employees. Most coworkers walk around like zombies and are not social or friendly at all. "
bad,"Weis's motto should be for employees ""Do more with less""!  No help and managers are required to stock shelves. Low Pay rate.  Upper management is clueless at store level.  Mandatory weekends, nights and holidays."
bad,"No paid vacation pretty much ever, have heard benefits suck and insurance covers practically nothing. If you want off for a holiday because you have plans, you're screwed because you can't request off. They don't care about how much you work and what you should recieve as benefits. The schedule is never up an appropriate amount ahead of time, then they get mad when you have a problem. There is never coverage available for any call offs, they rarely let you call someone to come in. Rarely any departments get overtime, unless it's a department lead/manager. The nicest people are the overnight workers, pretty sure it's because they don't have to deal with the daytime employees. They work you into the ground. They want you to do more than humanly possible all the time and you never get paid more for accepting something out of your job training. If you do get a raise for a new job position, they will screw you out of your yearly raise ($0.10- $0.30 per hour). Management is ALWAYS changing, whether it's front end managers, or store/assistant managers. They don't keep the good assistant store managers, they always take them away and stick us with ones who don't want to help. Been through three store managers in 2 years, bunches of assistant managers, and 4 front end managers. Not to mention individual departments are falling apart. It's like a downward spiral of people leaving. Every employee feels the same way and they all look miserable now. And when we have anyone higher up come to visit for the day, it's a scramble to get anyone free to help out in departments they're not even"
bad,I just do not enjoy my time at Weis markets. The work is way to easy and only becomes stressful with ignorant customers. I also am not receiving not enough hours at my position
bad,They do not care about their employees. They do not pay enough to make by. They literally refuse to hire more people even when sales increase and we continue to lose employees because then the managers wont get their bonus.
bad,Terrible co-workers any employees who actually get there work done will be disregarded and moved to another Weis location whether they like it or not.
bad,Not a good company to work for. Very cut throat. I wasn't even able to get off on jury duty. My check was stole and cashed. The company did absolutely nothing about it.
bad,"Weis in general is not bad. It all depends on your store management. There are definitely good managers and decent stores to work at, I just would not recommend grocery stores to anyone."
bad,"First job and it was good at first we all did our job up at the front but later would constantly get in trouble for not doing enough work when there were no customers. Constantly getting in trouble when it wasn't our faults, lies, and treated like robots. Management doesn't know how mange. others blaming on others to not get trouble. Meeting all the people and becoming friends with co workers is all I got from the job."
bad,Management does not care for workers professional well being. No advancement unless favored by management. Pay is very low.
bad,"I've worked at Weis for years, the leadership is poor. The management is uneducated and as unprofessional as it gets. Chances of advancement aren't based off of skill, experience, or drive to succeed, they are based off of how much you suck up to your boss. Weis loves to promote those who are blindly obedient. If you demonstrate critical thinking skills (e.g. express valuable opinions and/or give ideas of how things can be better) not only will you be held back because management will view you as a threat, but they will also use your ideas and claim them as their own to further themselves. Weis is also a ""customer is always right"" type of store, so if you work in customer service, good luck! If you give the customer what they (e.g. free stuff because they think a sale was incorrect even though it wasn't) you will get in trouble for having too many refunds, but if you explain to the customer how sales work and let them know they are wrong and cannot get a refund, they will ask to speak to a manager and that manager will give them a refund and a gift card and then you will be in trouble for not ""taking care if the customer"". You cannot win. Another huge issue is the gossip. Everyone talks about each other behind each other's backs and the worst culprits are the management staff. My advice would be: DO NOT WORK THERE!"
bad,Weis cares nothing about its employees. They do not believe in work life balance and wonder why they can't hold on to help. Upper management has no clue what goes on in stores and come up with ridiculous and non feasible expectations. Everyone works with a fear of there boss so no one opens mouth to give fresh ideas out of fear of upsetting upper management
bad,"As a bakery manager one would think that customer service and store representation would be key elements of a successful department...wrong! Managers are ""told"" and ""coached"" to treat staff as inferior and not to empower them at all. Mentality of the store managers and company itself is to reduce labor hours even though the department has increased sales and profit. Labor hours are distributed according to favoritism so if your store mgr doesn't like you, forget it!"
bad,"Stay away from Weis that is all I will say. the DOM on up are the worst, they expect way to much and don't listen to you when you talk."
bad,"I wouldnt say the company was terrible but the managers were the absolute worst. I worked there for 2.5 years, i got no raises.the managers would come to work mad and take it out on everyone. They all should be replaced"
bad,"Management doesn’t know how to talk to their employees. Also pay is to low but they still want workers to do the extra work, that’s not happening. To much bs."
bad,"It started great and they got awful towards the end. They don't care about loyal employees and their corporation is a JOKE. We were overworked and walked on. Managers don’t care, they have no passion."
bad,"Weis markets doesn't offer a competitive pay rate. The upper management is clueless and doesn't treat their employees well at all. If you're interested in being treated like dirt, this is the place to go."
bad,If you want to work somewhere that pays you fair and gives you full time hours then Weis is not the way to go. They only hire part time and the only way you get a full-time position is in management. The managers expect a lot of work for little pay and your annual raise is $0.15. terrible place to work if you're looking for a career
bad,"80% of the time there was a lack of support from management and management had a habit of dropping the ball."
bad,"After years of working at this specific store, and getting to see many other stores, the management and 'higher-ups' in the company seem, to me, how to not work a company properly."
bad,"I hated working at Weis. Constant rumors, and people backstabbing each other. You would always be pulled into the drama wether you liked it or not. The hours were terrible, and the pay was really bad. I worked there for 4 years, and never made it past $10. There is no room for advancing unless you were the managers favorite. Leaving there was one of the best days ever."
bad,"Our department was consistently understaffed which put a lot of pressure on the few who did work there. Each of us were expected to do the job of 2+ people most days, and it did not seem like the store was honestly trying to hire more employees to help out. I personally saw multiple people become so overwhelmed that they walked out, including department managers. On many occasions, there were only two people scheduled to close on a Friday night; a job that entitles slicing meats and cheese, making pizzas, frying food and cleaning up all at the same time. These were some of our busiest nights in terms of the amount of customers coming in, and it put a lot of stress on the sole two people working. When I worked in seafood, I would always have to stop what I was doing to go and help out the deli because they were getting overwhelmed."
bad,the managers don’t do anything. workers there get away with stealing and slacking off all the time. Managers are rude to Weis associates. we are not paid enough for the job we do.
bad,not friendly management isnt good no time off they dont work with you not friendly pay is not good it is impossible to move up through them sometime you have no hours
bad,Management has very little skill when dealing with everyday aspect of the business.  Corporate has completely gutted this company of very valuable employees.  Employees are treated like a cost and not an asset.  Hard workers are not rewarded and are often told to make up for employees who do not work.  Too much work to do in a day and still told that not enough effort was made.
bad,Horrible management worst pay. They never appreciate or reward you for your efforts. You are entrusted to go outside your comfort zone and perform tasks which is fine with me however the supervisor does not support you in your endeavors
bad,"Weis Markets is a company that doesn't pay enough and gives part timers 7 or 8 straight days working often. There is no work life balance whether full time or part time,"
bad,"Low hourly wage, hours, physical demanding job that is not worth working for. Will waste your time working for this company. Part time work associates are meant to break a leg. (literally)"
bad,just is not a family friendly place with there being a focus on keeping your friends happy with hours and money. It is very cliche and high school antics
bad,"stress full, management treated people like robots, it never mattered what the store policy was and the customer was always right and your job is always on the line because of it. the worst of retail"
bad,"The work quota was impossible to reach. I was only able to do it once by skipping all of my breaks and coming in early. The equipment made it impossible or lack of it. Maybe if you cheated the computer it would be reasonable?"
bad,Did not care to try and understand employees life and struggles and management didn't not try and work with employees to schedule work hours. We're rude to employees and talked down to. I would not recommend ever working here unless it's a last resort
bad,The only thing good about being a night stocker was that I could avoid the managers for the most part. But ultimately left due to being scheduled 9 days straight twice in one month.
bad,Did not like my experience there. Coworkers were rude and not very welcoming. Running the register was easy but I did not like the environment.
bad,ienjoyed the work i learned alot but the lack of support was unreal and not just support but training as to how to deal with customers in hot foods was stressful everyting was time based and there wasnt enough time or people to do it all deli was great but hot foods sucked and having to wait on beer customers while trying to do hot foods is ridiculous when beer goes to lunch they should have someone there to do beer sales besides hot foods
bad,The pay for this company is absolutely horrible and there is no room for advancement even though that there is huge room for it according to the training videos you watch. Also nobody should be so afraid when they hear corporate is coming in but with ours you should be because I've never seen people treated so horribly and talked down to so badly. It's one thing to yell at someone but it's something totally different to yell and swear at them in front of customers and other employees. 
bad,My experience with working with weis markets has been terrible. this has been my first job ever and what I found out about this store is alot of the managers dont care about your health or well-being and only focus on customer happiness. leaders of the store take little time to teach you on what you know and hope that you'll figure out what to do on your own. you often work alot with no help and get no future job working experience while working here. the hours are very flexable and some co-workers are very work friendly but other than that weis is not a company you want to work for or build your life to around it for any type of future. I say that this place is over demanding due to the fact the pay isnt as high as other retail stores and there is no benefits at all for working for this company.
bad,It's made perfectly clear that you are easily replaceable. Corporate cares only for profit. Managers only care about themselves.  They are the lowest paying jobs in town.
bad,"Not too much to say ,false promises and not enough hours ........... Supervisor barely leaves his office ,and people training you seem bothered they have to"
bad,"I worked at Weie Markets store #191 for just under 6 months. This store is in Gap, PA. I showed promise in customer service after a few months of good performance on the register, and got moved to a Service Desk Representative. This position means you learn how to do everything a Front End Manager can do for an extremely small portion of the pay they receive. It’s how they exploit young workers. Then, they schedule you for 38 hours so they don’t have to pay you full time benefits or make you a manager."
bad,"Stay far away from this place. I have worked at MANY of their locations over the past 12 years and they are always always understaffed. They expect the world from you but don’t give you the tools to do it. They treat their employees like garbage and you are trained to know that you can be replaced at any tine. You will never receive a thank you for your hard work, but will be severely reprimanded if one simple task is not completed.The pay is bad, but there is actually decent apportioning to advance to different posutiobs in the company."
bad,"I worked at a Weis for almost 2 years. During those two years, it was torture. It was as if I never left highschool, it was so childish, and so behind. It was absolutely ridiculous. Its nothing but talking bad about others, rumors, secrets, and so much more. The handbook says after you have been working there a year+ you could get paid vacation, so I took vacation and my (very childish) ""store-manager"" told me that I didn't qualify for paid vacation since I haven't been working there long enough. Which made no sense because the handbook says differently."
bad,Work with a horrible manager in the deli she doesn't listen to her employees when they talk about how the other employees in the deli department doesn't do their job I or someone else has to pick up the slack
bad,"It is just ok job for beginners not for long term.No good working environment ,Even if you do hard work you do not get any compliments if you are other country person. Management is very poor ."
bad,The store managers are paid quite well and terrified to lose their jobs due to being vastly under educated. They're very cut throat. They will take advantage of dept managers as much as possible before hiring help
bad,"Horrible place to work. Management is terrible. Any issue taken to management is ignored and not dealt with. Produce is taught that moldy product or anything with worms is still good, just take off the bad part and it will be sold in another form(cut fruit or vegetable packs, salad bar) when really it is bad and could make you sick. Completely disgusting."
bad,"I was always part time. When I started I worked 35 hours per week. Then it decreased to 20, then to 15, then to 8. Eventually it got so bad, i had no choice but to move on."
bad,"I was terrified to the point of tears over losing my job. I'm not entirely sound mentally, but I try to overcome it. I'm not as fast as the other people in my department but they don't seem to get that. I get complaints constantly about it, but I can only do so much. The hardest part is being stuck with tasks nobody else does, and hearing them complain about them being able to do it faster."
bad,poorly managed and maintained. Poor Human resource and working enviroment. No one to suggest improements to. No manager on duty. Favortism and a lack of cleansiness in the food departments.
bad,Worked in Bakery. Too much backstabbing from management and some of the employees. Makes up lies from management to get rid of you out of the position. Not friendly at all or professional.
bad,"Working here was very unrewarding. No matter how hard you worked, you were never given credit and corporate wanted more. Blood from a stone. You were given an 8 hour work load with 4 hours to do it and half the staff needed. No management responsibility whatsoever and just dumped on you because corporate dumped on them. Zero value of employees. Could be a great job if everyone worked as a team and were rewarded for doing so, but instead you would just be chewed up and spit out. No personal responsibility for any one."
bad,"I worked at this job for about 7 or 8 yrs., it was a job to get me out of the house. There was no advancement oppourtunities, the pay was bad and the management was horrible. The only enjoyable part was my co-workers. I enjoyed working with them as much as they enjoyed working with me. I would always say ""you burn more calories smiling""."
bad,No communication between management at different levels. Everyone has their own ideas how things should be run and their expectations do not reflect what they are willing to pay their employees. Corners are always cut and the people that stay with the company for too long always regret it. Be wary.
bad,I currently work here and it's all good when you first start but after a while it goes downhill you have to constantly struggle trying to get hours and they ate not worried about making money then keeping you happy do I wouldn't waste your time trying to work here
bad,"After  years working for Weis Markets it all came to an end in Jan. At first things were good,  then the last 4 years were a nightmare. If you want drama then this is the place for you., if you like to kiss  butt this is the place for you.  People are told one thing and nothing gets done. They will promise you a position and never follow through with it."
bad,Weis markets is not a good place to work unless you are looking for a starting job or need some extra money. After a year of service you are still making the equivalent of your starting salary (9-9.20 after a year). If you work harder than your coworkers you will not be recognized for it and they can not give you a raise until 6 months after you are there for a year and that is not guaranteed. I would not recommend to anyone unless it is your first job or you desperately need money.
bad,"I think I hated my time with Weis Markets the most. They paid me okay, even direct deposited my check every week. But the managers never did their job, scheduling was terrible, and the work was just awful."
bad,The managers at weis markets are very rude and do not care about your well being or what you are/aren't capable of doing. I almost got hurt while working here multiple times and they did not care at all. I almost got hurt because the managers refused to get me trained.
bad,"they pay pretty well to start but don't give raises where they are due/appropriate. I've worked there for 4 years and I make the same as someone who's worked as a cashier for 1. I'm cross trained in multiple departments and am a loyal employee. I feel like they take advantage of employees like myself who will go above and beyond, even when not asked."
bad,Management is horrible and rude. Customer environment is unfriendly. Policy standards are nearly impossible to uphold. Policies are constantly going through review and changing.
bad,"Weis starts off very slow pace, minimal work to be done. I've learned how to work different stations. Management was amazing overall, very professional. Co- workers were very welcoming and helpful. Hardest part of working was lack of sells, hours and pay. I enjoyed learning departments I wasn't very strong in."
bad,I worked for weis for about 6 months.  My hourly rate was reduced by upper store management without informing me of the change.  I quit shortly after due to this unethical practice.  Hourly management staff was very friendly and supportive as were most of my co-workers.  Some staff were extremely lazy and did not complete their daily work which required part-time employees to do most of the work.  I no longer shop @ this store.
bad,"The store I worked at was just horrible like the managers never knew what they were doing. There was no structure, the whole place was just sad and annoying."
bad,"A lot of standing around when it’s not busy, manager not the nicest person in the entire world. Very easy beginning job. Customers at this store were very nice."
bad,"It is my opinion that Weis Markets is a poorly managed and very ""cutthroat"" company. After four years, I am still making the minimum wage. There is a general lack of upper management interaction with the employees and a rather large distinction between full and part time compensation."
bad,Good for teenagers anybody looking for a real job should look elsewhere the day to day work was not bad however pay was awful and no opportunity to increase your wages
bad,"you get yelled at to do your job and six others , i learned  that not everyone in this world cares about your health or your child's health . the manegment is a pile of dog dodo and do not care about anyone but themselves ,"
bad,"Typically you come in, time in, and get sent to a register. You then have to stay there for the rest of your 8/9/10 hour shift. You get a lunch break and then a ten minute break. Other than that you just have to stand there and ring people out the entire rest of the time. I learned a lot about food stamps, WIC checks, produce codes, how to deal with difficult customers, and money handling. The workplace culture is not inviting, I liked my co-workers but you don't get to talk to them much as you are pinned to your register. The hardest part can be dealing with customers and ringing out large orders. I would get stressed out seeing a huge cart full of stuff coming at me, or when someone would bring WIC checks into the fast check out lane. The most enjoyable part would be the co-workers, and leaving."
bad,"Management as a whole didn't care about the employees (they treated us like property).  There were many good, honest working employees that were treated poorly.  Some managers even yelled at employees on the floor in front of customers - very unprofessional.  I would not suggest working there but that might be an industry standard.(?)"
bad,"I felt as though the managers I had did so close to nothing that they employees want to do almost nothing. The only thing that stopped us from doing nothing was the fact that it was reinforced in us over and over again that while they got to do nothing, we had to serve and take care of customers. This job also does not pay well, and does not pay extra to run the service desk unless you specifically ask them to, even though the raise is promised during the training. Also, they refuse to pay overtime and overwork their employees by not scheduling enough people to get daily tasks done and expecting one or two people to work enough for five or six people."
bad,"This job is ideal for a college student looking to balance a personal life, school, and work."
bad,At first it was a great job. But after holidays it feels like we work in same kind of place that was in the movie Norma ray. Hours cut to the bone.no one happy
bad,The up most ridiculous company I have ever been employees with. Hate getting up to go to work with people that are poorly trained management staff. Managers are so undereducated that they can not even merchandise product to make it make sense. No raise for over 3 years. Lied to numerous times about a chance to advance in this place. Employees are aloud to do whatever they please with no consequences. The less you do the more you are rewarded. You work your butt  off with no appreciation at all from any level. This company pays for incompetent ‘specialists ‘. There are thousands of these so called specialist and none of them are on the same page. Waste so much money on these useless people that walk around and point Fingers and don’t have a clue what they are talking about. Waste waste waste. That money could be added to their employees paychecks and maybe they would care more. They come in and change things up only to have them leave and we put it back the way it should be before they touched it.
bad,"Yes, unfortunately, even good jobs can be dead-end jobs—or positions with little to no room for advancement. Unless you already have your absolute dream job, you’re probably working towards some sort of higher goal in your career—a more senior position, additional responsibilities, or new skills. But to make sure you have the opportunity to reach those goals, it’s important to be aware of your potential for growth—and to realize when you’re in a job where that doesn’t exist. And that was my problem with Weis."
bad,"I was capable and did managerial duties for this job for almost 2 months while our manager left. I knew what to do in all aspects of the job.However when I screwed up once, I was tossed to the side when people do half the work I did, still work there."
bad,good company. was hired for overnight and was kept on days but still recieved overnight pay
bad,"I was really excited to work there. I got told they needed help so i got hired right away. I work very hard , went on days that people called out etc the manager was horrible to deal with . acted like she was perfect and noone could do the job. They got a click you wont stay past the 90 days there. You shouldnt feel like everyone talking about you when you walk in. Very catty. They need to grow up"
bad,Don’t work here unless you NEED a job it is a waste of time and offers no enjoyment. Working with the public quickly becomes the worst part of the job with people constantly repeating smart comments about how you look bored and need something to do.
bad,"I had a great work  experience, but it's not the type of job I want forever. The management wasn't great, the salary was so bad that I couldn't support myself that much."
bad,I wasnt given enough hours to work in a week. 6 hours a week was all I was given. The pay isnt worth the job since it is minimum wage. Would not recommend working for Weis unless it's for a first job to gain experience.
bad,"Been with them for two many years of stress and harrasment. They cut your hours as panishment to get what they want. And you work like two people cleaning up day shifts mess. While the managers talk all day, and wonder why they do not get their work done. Your like their puppet. All the company cares about is the money in their pocket. Years ago it was nice to work there, not now move on."
bad,"A typical day is rather standard for retail stores, the exception is that the ""promote from within"" culture that Weis claims to be fond of doesn't exist. You will get hired easily enough but then will not get any real benefits or compensation and will not climb any ladders without first needing someone else above you to leave, retire, or get fired."
bad,Management in this company is bad. Only seem to care about their business when someone from higher up is coming to visit. If you are in a management position and a woman they pretty much run you out of there.
bad,"I dont know if he is still there, but Will the store manager was not a nice guy.  He was not nice to floor workers, but was so fake nice to the customers. He is very loud and obnoxious. It seems like that is the kind of people that get promoted these days.  You bust your butt for a company for years, and new management comes in and doesn't care how long you've been there and how hard you worked.  Otherwise the job was ok, you ran around like a chicken with your head cut off for minimum wage. What's not to love? ?"
bad,I thought the weis be a nice place to work but they don't give you no hours they don't give you no money they will stress you out and they don't know how to treat people in it and a nosy and they will tell your business
bad,"I wouldn't work there again the pay was low and they never gave me a review in 2 years there. The rules change from manager to manager, be careful what  shopping cart you use sometimes the use them for trash"
bad,I have no good things to say about weis markets. I have friends who work there and they say it has improved but in my opinion the job is not worth the hassle
bad,This is one of the worst jobs I've had. I got yelled at by customers and managers alike in front of coworkers and other customers. Very miserable and not the kind of work I'd enjoy
bad,"I moved inventory from the back storerooms to the sales floor.  There wasn't much interaction between me and customers, but when there was I helped customers to find what they were looking for and made sure that they got all of the help that they needed.  I was responsible for the appearance of 13 aisles of food."
bad,"I wasn't really there long enough to properly review this company, but I didn't have any problems with anyone."
bad,no flexablility no movement in the company and no reason to be there at all
bad,"Ran register, bagged groceries, assisted customers, cleaned, answered phones,"
bad,I have been at Weis  Markets for almost 4 years and i'm not very happy because i cant the hours i want and i'm stuck one a department i'm in.I want to be a cashier again but they are giving a run around and i'm not happy.
bad,I ran 3 departments with no pay raise. Unloading trucks for 2 departments dairy & Gm/Hbc plus ran the cash office on top of running register & no help
bad,it was pretty boring days there. i didnt learn much i did not already know. management was a joke they were not the best and no discipline at weis. not much on workplace culture considering that we never got to talk to anyone because you would just be slacking off and not doing your job. hardest part about the job was just getting myself to show up i have never hated a place so much that i have worked at.
bad,the place was terrible and boring. the people were rude and i was getting paid garbage to work there. really did not enjoy some of the managers and the customers
bad,This was probably one of the worst career choices I've ever chosen. The only thing I benefited from it was I learned how to work a register and also came out of my comfort zone on customer service and helping others in the work place.
bad,At this moment the store I work in has one of the lowest morale that I have ever seen in my working years.  Unfortunately they seem more interested in turning a profit than their employees.  Communication is almost nil.  You will be told one thing by a person and an hour later something else by another.  The only consolation is majority of the employees are in the same predicament with many searching quietly elsewhere.
bad,"I still shop at Weis,  and the people in the stores  are wonderful, Employees are great,  helpful,  amicable.    The Corporate bean counters in Sunbury  are the problem.  "
bad,All this company cares about is corporate. Deli management was flat out terrible. did not listen to concerns of employees. Verbally abusive. short breaks.
bad,I enjoy working with the public. I love working with people and helping them get what they want the way that they want it. I always have a smile and enjoy making others smile as well.
bad,"A basic day at this job would be, standing in one place for several hours, about 2, 10 min breaks. A 30 min break if you worked over 6 hours. Constant, repetitive movements and operations. My co-workers were distant at this job. Most of them kept to themselves. This job was not hard at all, even when it was busy."
bad,It was a horrible place to work. The management would scream at you for no reason.
bad,this was not what i wanted to do for the rest of my life. I really did not learn to much of anything cause i was already a cashier before.
bad,"A typical day at work would include running the cash register and dealing with customers. The truth is this was my least favorite job, because the pay is almost nothing, the managers seemed as if they didnt like their jobs at all and most of the people seemed to goof off and in general did'nt seem like they cared. I learned what type of jobs I like and appreciate and the types that are not for me. The hardest part of the job was the lack of caring or passion in my co-workers and managers. The most enjoyable aspect was talking to customers, and helping them when they needed it."
bad,It could have been alot better and managment could have done a lot better.they cut my hours back to the point I had to quite. Never steady and content questionably
bad,"Poor corporate management  "
bad,It was a great job for working during school and helping with gas. although the work environment was awful. with lack of management and poor treatment of there employees. i would not recommend them for full time work
bad,"They make alot of promises they dont keep.  When it comes time for a raise, no matter how hard you work.  You cant "" excel"" . you can only "" meet"" their requirements."
bad,I really like some o if the people that I worked with but I feel that I was unfairly left go because of some health issues and had taken a paper in to be filled out for medical leave but when I needed it back but nobody knew where it was.
bad,its a horrible place to work. the management was distasteful. its a shame that they lose such good people. a typical day at work consists of me being alone for 5+ hours. i learned that working at this establishment was the biggest mistake in my life. the management was demeaning.
bad,"Weis Markets was my first job as a teenager and I worked there throughout college. There was no communication between management and my department, and managers had no clue on how to assist the front end when we were understaffed, thanks to the managers.  I made minimum wage supervising cashiers and dealing with customer service issues (which were never positive)--the same amount of money new hires made."
bad,They did not train me on my first day. They threw me in an isle and had me stock. I had very little time to get to know the isle and was yelled at my second day for not stocking as fast as everyone else. The management of the night shift was not good and no one was friendly.
bad,"Some of the people there were very nice, but management was not great at all. Sometimes things happen with family where you need to leave early and management was not understanding at all. Customers are very rude and disrespected you constantly. It is not a great environment at all."
bad,"Most of the people you will deal with in this company are decent people to work with, Some of them even go above and beyond what is expected of them. The few that are left out of the above mentions are the people in upper management that show obvious favoritism to certain individuals in the store."
bad,"Hectic and just very over whelming. Not very good management and always changing schedules without telling co workers. Most enjoyable part of the job was working in produce it felt like family. I have learned how to use deli machines, use the bakery ovens, make tags and signs also count money, manage other peoples schedules and made sure customers get in out of the store happy. Hardest part of the job is being told what you do wrong everyday."
bad,"First off, DIRTY BATHROOMS !!!!"
bad,"Management sucks no advancement not enough help would never work here again. Corporate doesn't care.i worked in the deli by myself most days, yet all the other departments had more than enough help"
bad,"I worked for the staple store in Sunbury, PA.  It is a highly stressful environment.  Often times the manager work in discordance with their employees.  Many times tasks are ignored, leading to a high rate of theft within the store."
bad,"okay "
bad,"I love my job...I decorate cakes! How could it get any better for a girl who loves exploring her creativity?! Well once the excitement of a new cake decorating job sinks in, you begin to realize that the managers (not so much the bakery manager) expects you to do a million things at one time...""Make sure the tables are pulled forward, do your freezer case, service case, cold case...oh yea, and make sure you get your cake orders complete!"" Sounds easy but if you are the only one in the bakery who is a cake decorator then it's stressful. I enjoy exploring my creativity and having my cakes be not the ordinary ""store-bought"" cake, however upper management (for some reason) wants all of our service/freezer/cold cases to look the same...plain and boring. Who wants an ordinary cake that you could get anywhere? Not me! A couple months ago, I remember there were only 2 people working in the bakery-myself and the baker...I'm pretty sure my store manager should have been working harder to get a bakery manager in to help us out, but that's Weis Markets for you!"
bad,If the district manager sees you as an intellectual threat he will black ball you a nd do his best to secure his own job. He will threaten others to accomplish his ignorant ways. He will tell HR in sunbury pa to put down you only worked part time minimum wage for all your years at Weis. He will make it that you Will have to retain a lawyer.
bad,Really is a joke but it all depends on what kind of manager you get for the whopping year that they're there. The one I had was an absolute joke. Everyday he would flip it around on how he wanted you to do something. If you're a female you have to prove yourself everyday. HR is a joke too they take up for the bad managers. They think it's ok to scream at you. High turn over rate
bad,A typical day at work was basically coming in ready to work a 8-4 shift. Waiting for our truck to come so we can stock shelves with missing products. The management team sucked. They would just walk around and complain about nothing getting done but no one ever helped. They mistreated co workers and never regonized good workers. One thing i hated most about the job was the pay. One thing i did like about the job was the co workers i worked with became my friends.
bad,I worked at the Weis Markets in Dover. The managers are absolutely horrible. There is no desire to word hard for people who seem so miserable and never are happy at work.
bad,"Worked at the gas station for a few months. The work is slow, great if you need to slow down. They promised me fulltime and after being hired they told me I would never get fulltime hours. I had to get a second job and after letting them know I could only work certain days, they cut me down to one day a week. They do not care about their employees. During a snow storm I was told if I couldn't find a way in I would lose my job, even after never calling off."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working at Weis Markets. In my experience, it was terrible. Everyday when I came to work it was always a mess. You don't get paid well at all, you can make more money in fast food. The only good thing about this company is that they are really good with minor laws and not allowing minors to over work hours."
bad,Weis markets Catawissa is a small grocery store that is very understaffed full of arrogant management and employees who don't like to pull their weight.
bad,poor manners on everyone there corrupt managers and owners the ones in charge of it all very bad work place . the co workers always doing stuff they shouldnt blaming it on wrong people when i would report something nothing was ever done about it very sad place also very dirty i thought id never wanna eat food from their deli eww just bad all around
bad,Always under staffed and cutting hours. Wages were too low and always had under 12 hours. Management is terrible and bosses treat others unfairly. Employees are under appreciated and given more to do than their own job.
bad,"this isn't a job to live off of.  it needs to be a stepping stone to something better.  management is old and closed minded.  not open to change.  new staff is usually eager to learn, but held back by the philosophy of ""this is how we've always done it"".  definitely need to get new blood into the departments and revitalize the company."
bad,the hardest part of working there was managment wasnt great. i learned alot of things. most enjoyable part of my job was looking forward to my regular customers
bad,Never appreciated anything. Help was poor. No coverage or barely any coverage in the evenings. Department was always low in the mornings. Keeping the department full clean and rotated. Seeing customers and some employees that were actually nice.
bad,The management would expect their employees to do more than an individual could handle in one day and would frown upon even the hardest workers for not completing an impossible task.
bad,"I work part time here its horrible. Hands are cold, workplace is freezing, heavyloads of freight. Low pay low hours (25 weekly) sometimes 15-20 full timers dont do any work here manager socializes all day i need to get out asap!!!"
bad,"Managers have absolutely no communication skills and make you do work that they can easily do themselves. "
bad,I would come in cull the racks throwing out what is bad. then I would stock the shelves with the oldest product that we have. then I would break down the truck stocking the shelves. after that we would either clean or prep produce for the next day
bad,"Benefits stink"
bad,"The job itself is not bad. Was a cashier, customer service, and frozen food leader. Brad, store manager, is the reason I quit because I was suppose to receive my full time benefits after a month of being leader and never did."
bad,"enjoyed helping the customers and displaying the seafood fresh fish display. "
bad,"I was lured into the bakery with promises of becoming a full-time cake decorator, which came with offers of free professional training and, once that was complete and 90 days had passed, a significant pay increase.  Unfortunately, the ""professional training"" was just a 3 hour-long session from which they kept pulling me away to slice bread or sweep, but the other employees were allowed to participate in.  The hours were either too much or too little.  I often had to work until 8 p.m., which wasn't bad, but I was completely alone for the last 4 hours, left with the rest of the work that no one else bothered to complete because they just shifted it onto me.  When I alerted my manager that I was being saddled with the work of 3 employees to be completed in 4 hours, she just said I need to be faster.  Trying to do break-out (a 2 hour job itself), bake, slice, bag, tag and place 8-12 racks of bread/rolls, 4-8 racks of cookies, 2-4 racks of pies, as well as help customers, do all the day's dishes, clean the tables, shelves, counters and the donut case, and sweep and mop the entire department and cooler is absolutely impossible in 4 hours.  Department managers also gave contradictory orders, so no matter what, I would have to disobey one of them.  When I asked them which job they wanted me to do first, they accused me of wasting time and yelled at me.  If I did either job they asked me to do before another, I got yelled at for not doing the other one first.  Darned if you do, darned if you don't.  Also, after 90 days there was still no pay increase, so after 100 days I inquired and"
bad,The managers there are very rude and so are most of the other employees. so this is not a place i would recomend for anyone 
bad,"No benefits what-so-ever. Just minimum wage. Management treats their workers like dirt, everyone at the Weis I used to work at (Tannersville, PA) hated their job. I wonder why? Threatening your employees with right-ups if they do not sell ten ""secret sale"" items. Acting like it's your fault when you need an override. Management would often have ""staff meetings"" with large amounts of pizza, subs, and soda. The workers didn't receive even a scrap of anything. DO NOT WORK HERE!"
bad,This is definately NOT a place to work if you number one priority is family.
bad,"I worked for Weis for a good amount of time before I moved out of the area. We had great lower management in each department but upper and corporate managemant were always clueless. They would tell us to stay late but reprimand us for not cutting back hours. They would try to schedule me during my times I marked unavailable on my availability sheets. Upper manager constantly went behind the department managers back and I've seen them make my manager cry on more than one occasion. When I asked for a raise because I wasn't making enough money to make rent, they laughed at me and told me to get a second job. I already had two. They started employee incentives programs and upper managers constantly won the prizes meant for middle and low level employees. Overall, I loved my department, but hated the management and that's ultimately what led me to move away and get out of the area. If you're looking for a job that doesn't make you hating yourself everyday, apply elsewhere."
bad,"At first working here was great, but then we go a new manager that doesn't seem to know what she is doing. We've had days where we were running low on product and had turn customers away cause we couldn't sell them anything. On top of that we rarely ever have the right cleaning products to get things cleaned and sanitized. Also I asked to become a full-time employee and they told me no because they wanted somebody who can work on weekends and and who wasn't in school"
bad,"If you enjoy working for more than 5 hours at a time without even a 15 minute break, apply here. If the store gets busy, the company would rather have you suffer than allow you to have something to eat."
bad,The only consistent positive aspect of working for Weis Markets is that associates get 10% off all Weis products they purchase. Really think hard before you push the send button when you apply to work for Weis Markets.
bad,"Store is not as busy as it used to be. I blame horrible prices and the fact that you have to buy more than 1, 2 or however many items in order to get the sale price. The main issue is being an employ there. The computer, yes the computer, does the scheduling! Does not make any sense?! Management treats you like slaves in there."
bad,"I feel that the management is poor, the schedules are not organized well and are changed at the last minute, hours are cut and we are short staffed, it is stressful, there is low pay with minimal raises, and I don't feel appreciated or listened to."
bad,"After 2 years and 4 raises I’m finally at $10... but what did it cost? My sanity. There are many things you don’t see as a cashier other than it is repetitive and it does not pay very well. After a year and a half of that, I got ‘promoted’ to Customer Service/Front End Monitor. This gets you a very little raise with a lot more responsibility. It is at this point when you realize this company does not care about its employees and never will. Good starting job for young people, however not a long term job."
bad,"At this particular location:"
bad,Work full time hours but only part time pay. Move people all around within store and company. Do more than you are supposed to do because other people not being productive.
bad,This company expects you to give your entire life to them. Especially as a full time manager. Don’t expect anything in return. They’re also extremely sexist. Men working for the company for one year are making more money then woman working there for 10 plus years doing the same job just as good as or better then them.
bad,"Weis used to be a great place to work, even with shortage of staff and all other challenges, somehow you just wanted to give it your all! But since mid 2017, Discrimination is flourishing in MD Pharmacies... Suddenly if you are different, it doesn’t matter what credentials you have, how long or loyal you have been ...  you are held to a completely different standard, you simply don’t have the same opportunities, and you are harassed openly.... No basic fairness.... If black and you want to maintain your dignity, or your sanity.... then only stay on if you are desperate ....but for sure .... keep looking."
bad,"Unstable manager ,dirty store, no time for breaks or lunch. I had trouble with the payroll department .Did not pay me for 3 weeks had trouble getting my address correct for over 1 month.."
bad,"I would say working at Weis wasn’t bad but it wasn’t that great either. I worked here part time when I was still in college and they worked great around my schedule. The work was quite easy as I did the i-shop department which consisted of shopping on the customers behalf and having their groceries ready for pickup at a decent time. I did the register from time to time when the store hours got busy and towards the end of my one year employment here I ran the bakery department closing shift. The managers didn’t really say much to you just a hi and that was pretty much it. The pay was average at the time (2011) a little above minimum wage, but not much. I think it’s ok for a high school or college student who needs a few hours work each week, but definitely not somewhere to make a career out of or live off of each month."
bad,"Management doesn't back up their employees when facing difficult customers who are in the wrong. This results in customers learning that if they argue over even the smallest thing, they're sure to get the item for free or a gift card for the inconvenience, while management undermines associates and their authority to fulfill their job requirements in front of said customers. Full timers are nearly nonexistent because management doesn't want to pay their salaries or for their benefits, and they'll often be given the choice to either be transferred to another store, or be demoted to part time. New rules are constantly being implemented or changed by corporate who clearly do not understand what it's like to work on the store level, as they're counterproductive to getting the job done effectively. Customers are constantly frustrated by the lack of communication from the company over changes to sales/rewards systems, and employees at the store level are not given proper directives regarding how to handle this. There's also the issue that once an associate is cross trained, they're constantly thrown back and forth within the same shift, even within the same hour, to get multiple things done. There's nothing inherently wrong with keeping busy, but there is a problem when you're a monitor and suddenly expected to jump on self checkout to cover a lunch, then thrown on register because the store is busy and you don't have enough cashiers scheduled, and then you try to take a break so you have to pull the person working iShop to cover for you. It creates a lot of chaos, especially if you've"
bad,They wouldn't allow me to change my hours and they refused to become more flexible when I had to go back to school after summer vacation that is why I left . They complained and nagged at me for calling off a lot when my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer .
bad,"I was a cashier and Weis was the worst place I have ever worked at. The customers were okay some were not nice but that’s people everywhere you work. What made it so awful was the co workers, they were unwilling to help the whole time I was there. If I needed money or coins for my drawer on a busy day I would go the whole day without any change or certain dollars I needed to give customers change, sometimes I would have to count dollars out in quarters. I had even asked multiple times In a 5 or 7 hour shift for coins and small bills and i got nothing and then would get yelled at when they would check my drawer and i was short.  I got yelled at a lot when I asked to go on breaks, we were allowed a 10 minute break on short shifts and a 30 on a long shift. I frequently saw certain co workers standing around talking for long periods of time gossiping when a Customer needed help with something that I could not properly provide without higher up assistance. I repeatedly had to apologize to the customer for the long wait and sometimes the customer would get frustrated and go over demanding assistance. I was provided with mis information and bad instructions on how to do things properly and then get yelled at INFRONT of customers for simply doing what i was told. I’d sometimes have customers comforting me saying that it was not my fault and they are appalled by my co worker(s) actions. I frequently left work crying in frusteration dreading coming back because the co workers were awful. If your younger then 30 i highly recommend not applying for a job here, save yourself a lot of mental"
bad,My department manger is not good he belittles the employees the department manager dose not no how to lead talked behind everyone's back. Talks to the customers rudely.
bad,"Management played favorites and belittled employees who tried to stand up for themselves. They constantly praised the lazy workers and complained about the ones who were actually trying."
bad,"Weis offers flexible scheduling which is great for people in school. It's a good first-time job, but I wouldn't recommend long term, as they don't really offer full time or advancements."
bad,"the management expects too much from its sales associates and other employees, there is very low company moral, most coworkers ive spoken to except the managers hate their jobs, if something goes wrong its ""always the associates fault' the htreats of termination have gotten out of hand"
bad,"Working at Weis Markets for me included cashiering, working in the online shopping department and also helping numerous other departments. With any advancement where I was promised extra pay, I always failed to receive that extra pay."
bad,Most enjoyable part of my job is  working with a Happy crew. Learned a lot of things about my department and how it works . If your trained correctly and know what's expected of you from the different shifts and the different tasks you must do daily. You can have a nice work day and Every day is eventful.
bad,"Management is the problem. Lack of communication between departments. No hours for the seasoned employees. New employees being run ragged not knowing what they are doing. Irate customers walking out because of newbies mistakes. Managers refusing to cooperate with employees requests of better pay, better hours, vacation days, benefits, etc."
bad,"deli manager does not like to work"
bad,"When I started it was great. I loved the vacations and the extra pay on a Sunday. However, in recent events it's terrible at my store. Management needs huge upgrade. They all gossip on each other instead of giving constructive criticism. There is no communication at all between management teams, the managers do not care for the employees whatsoever. The company itself is very cheap. They cut funds to the bag quality, the store maintenance, and even cut my hours as a result. I am only working two days a week and cannot afford to live in my home. The manager at my store is kind of a creep and stares at female employees and the ones that he stares at are the ones that get all the hours. Disappointed in my store"
bad,Employees and their barely taken care of. Bare minimum work space quality. Little hours given while hiring more employees and still giving them low hours as well. People who had been working there weren't being paid what they deserved. Employees that worked there for 8 years were being paid the same as the employees that were just hired a year prior. Management was horrible!!!!!!!!! You could tell that they didn't care about their employees.
bad,They will only hire you part-time so that they don't have to pay benefits. The location i was at even attempted to turn all full-timers who had been working there years into part-time. Telling them they either had to drop to part-time or transfer to another location
bad,"Extremely productive environment, friendly atmosphere, employees throughout store need more training, hardest part of job was the long hours involved due to constant callouts. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with regular customers and satisfying their needs on a daily basis. Upper Management not very professional. "
bad,"Super long days, salaried and not fully compensated for hours or workload. Disrespect from upper management, compensation not nearly on par with industry standards."
bad,"When I worked at Weis, my manager couldn't care less if he tried. All he did was get a minor pregnant, and move to Florida because of it. Was not a great place to work."
bad,I personally do not recommend working for the company. Pay was terrible. Hours were terrible. Management was never available when needed. Constantly short staffed.
bad,"Cashiers come and go at the Havre de Grace store.  Young girls stand around chit chatting, playing on their cell phones, gossiping about other employees, while the cashiers that do have integrity are busting their butt.  Weis has lost a lot of their customers to Lidl and Shoprite, primarily due to lack of cashiers and poor front end management."
bad,"In comparison to my previous job, Weis Markets was significantly better. But as the honeymoon period began to fade, I began to see the workplace for what it truly is. Management is significantly bad. I can sense how little they care for the store and their employees. Especially the store manager. In comparison to the previous store manager who everyone, customers included, loved, this one falls so short. He doesn't take the time to get to know his employees or customers. He's so distant that most of the time I hardly knew he was in the store at all. "
bad,I have never recieved a raise despite near perfect job performance reports.  Only State mandated pay raises.  worked as PAC for 6 months before they raised my pay to 11.00 per hour. Well below the average. Very poorly managed.
bad,It's only gotten worse since they started letting a computer have total control of scheduling. It's way understaffed and everyone is miserable. It was definitely better when I started
bad,"i get along with my coworkers. however there seems to be an issue with the Mars employees that came to work here, after Mars went out of business. I feel i have been discriminated against because of my age, and the fact that I was a Mars employee. I have heard management talk bad about the Mars employees that came to work here."
bad,"The workload was fair along with the compensation given for that. The only unattractive part of working in this particular Weis for myself was the unprofessional attitude and approach of the management staff. They would tell confidential information (write-ups, warnings) to employees that it did not concern at all. I believe these things should be brought directly to the attention of said associate, and to ONLY said associate, not any other co-workers."
bad,"They only care about the bottom line and treat employees as an unwanted resource, Store management differs and good managers are what make the job doable, but when a bad manager comes along, they are insufferable. Employees who do any work are expected to do everything absolutely perfectly for minimal pay, expectations are constantly being piled on despite minimal staffing, and benefits are next to nothing."
bad,"A typical day involves me scanning and bagging groceries. The time that doesn't include that involves cleaning my register and waiting for customers. It doesn't challenge me or change at all. The pace is painfully slow, and does not keep up my satisfaction."
bad,If you decide to work for this company as a manager they will expect it to be your life. Every holiday and blackout from Nov thru Jan for vacation. Depending on the store manager handbook rules vary. Some managers think they are the owners of weis. Worked here for ten plus years and got pushed out by a store manager that thought he was Mr.weis. shame that the human resource department doesn't see that over 8 people that were long term employees either got fired by him or asked to be transferred.
bad,I worked for weis for 3 years. tried countless times to move into small management position. was always denied. all employees were disgruntled making it not a fun place to work
bad,"Management nor the company cares about their employees! Only give part-time hours and don't have a problem cutting back either, so the one income won't pay the bills!"
bad,"It's not really work that can support anyone on its own, and therefore not really worth holding onto unless you can't get anything better. I mean, it's a supermarket, you're not gonna get paid well and you're not gonna get a career out of it, so there's not much to say, really."
bad,"It was a decent working environment but no benefits, low pay, stress. I did not like to work there. Every day I was in a bad mood. The customers aren't pleasant."
bad,"the job is pretty set, repetitive and easy to learn. answering phones, processing bill pay payments, processing western union sends and receives, selling cigarettes, and ringing up lottery tickets. lines get long and you're the only one behind the desk for the most part."
bad,"I have never met a person who had worked at Weis who didn't say something along the lines of ""It destroys your soul."" Very low pay for the amount of work, they discourage full time because then they have to give you benefits, they refused to give me more than 16 hours a week."
bad,Stressful place to work. Constantly being overworked and underpaid. Management does not handle problems properly or at all. Hours are at the bare minimum so you can barely operate a department but they expect you to just do more and more with less hours and less associates. I have never been felt so disrespected by a company than I did when I worked for Weis Markets.
bad,"I wouldn’t consider this job full time, they don’t recognize you when you work hard only your flaws, therefore making it impossible to move up in the company"
bad,A typical day was stressful because they lacked organization and consistency. I learned to not let people take advantage of your work. Management was alright at times but other times they walked all over you like you didn't matter because you were replaceable. The hardest part of the job was leaving because I in general loved the people I worked with but we all agreed the place wasn't enjoyable to work for.
bad,work ethics and professionalism really lacked by many no team work. No respect poor communication. Management and employees drinking on the job taking many cigarette breaks etc.
bad,Worked here for 5 years. And it really helped me learn and advance my skills in decorating. However the lack of communication and lack of help it made it hard to do daily task in a stress free environment.
bad,"When I first arrive at work I immediately go to my department and face everything, making the shelves look fuller, cleaner, and more organized, then; depending on the day, I will either, unload the shipment I ordered, do sales tags, or create an order based on my departments needs. I've learned about Computer Generated Ordering, management skills, organizational skills, excellent customer service skills in which I have had numerous customer compliments about me, and I have also learned how to properly address, interact with, and please the corporate representatives of the company. The management overall is very likable and willing to work with my needs and availability, though sometimes the store manager gets frustrated with my school schedule. I like almost all of my coworkers and have never gotten into any kind of argument or altercation with anyone at the store. The hardest part of my job is trying to juggle everything while being a one-man department. I have to clean, organize, order, count, stock, oversee product and sales resets, and take care of damages and shrink for my department, while also helping in other departments due to my cross-training. But I love learning the new departments and I enjoy learning as much as I can to become the best asset I can be for a company."
bad,"The managers didn't care about the employees. There were terrible benefits. There was no contact information to report anything. They hired a lot of people so they didn't have to hire full time employees and give out benefits. They often hired too many people and had to cut hours. I didn't like this place at all. Also, they pay you terribly."
bad,It is a nice first job. To those who don't work making minimum wage is a good thing. However I only suggest you work at Weis for job experience and job experience ONLY. after about one year you should quit and use your new found job experience to find better new job.
bad,you get paid barely over minimum wage and nobody is ever happy to be there. everyone has an attitude and managers get other associates to do thier jobs. they promise raises that you either don't get or you get barely anything
bad,A typical day can be extreamely boring. I've learned patience and how to communicate effectively. the management at the store that i work at gets the job done. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irrational customers
bad,"yell at employees for no reason "
bad,Improved profits and increased sales for the salad bar and produce department. Expanded customer base for the salad bar.
bad,I learned so much through Weis Markets. Through-out the company there are many different ways to move up in the company. Many opportunties for young driven employees. Needs better training for upcoming management but over all a well put together company. I loved going to work and seeing the customers and helping them out with what they desired.
bad,"I was hired for part time cashier then quickly was asked to move into the book keeper position then to get more income took front end asst manger, It became to stressful so moved to another position and then was promised one thing and then was not followed through with so I moved on."
bad,"N/a, I don't have any..  too many to mention,........its a job, not much to add,  bouncing Managers around and no proper training,  just go to it...........    ......... ..............."
bad,"Not a good place to work, managers are not nice to everyone. They are only nice to the ones they are close with. Customers are sometimes nice depends on the day."
bad,"No communication, poor management, treat lazy employees better than the hard workers, no training, move employees to different departments and locations without warning"
bad,"Weis is a grocery market, where routine was an everyday occurrence.  Depending on what time of day I went to work, depends on the activity I started.  I worked a rotating shift, so I hand handled every type of task.  The morale has been at a all time low in the building, for they cut back our amount of help, while increasing our work load.  I have been making it work, but for me, it is time to move on.  Communication is important in my life, so engaging with customers and associates was a privilege, given."
bad,"I work third shift. We get 4 trucks a week, the truck loads vary. But it's easy, yet stressful. Third shift has to put up all of the freight, and front the whole store. Your typical grocery store kind of deal. You learn as you go. You can have fun with your coworkers."
bad,"i worked in produce, it is a pretty nasty job, there was moldy broccoli and my manager at the time just told me to wipe the mold off and put it on the shelf, the back room was nasty and mold in places."
bad,"Weis markets is an okay first job they do not let you improve you dont get many hours and you only make 9 an hour unless your a manager or meat department. Managers do not know what is going on nor do they deal with any problems. You can bring a problem up to the manager with no hope of it getting solved, there are many empty promises just to keep you employed. You are supposed to do other departments jobs when theh cannot do it properly. Overall horrible company to work for. P.s you get no raises no matter how long you have been there."
bad,"As soon as the pay increased the hours got cut and the people that made more than the new minimum pay there, they all found a reason to fire. Poor way to run a business."
bad,Working here can be very stressful especially if the management is as cut throat as they used to be. This place requires a flexible schedule and for you to work weekends very often.
bad,management was terrible expect you to learn the entire store and still make minimum wage and do all the jobs every day of the week and still no full time
bad,"Weis market in Danville is very fast paced and very stressful. Nothing seems like it’s quite good and enough and management is never happy with any of the workers"
bad,They always want more from you and the pay doesn't reflect it.They are very cheap when it comes to hours and fulltime employment.poor management.not enough help
bad,"Working here was probably just a waste of my time. There was no room for advancement at all, the employees were rude and disrespectful, and the managers were not nice."
bad,"You’ll find the job to be not what it’s worth. If you are young it’s a fine enough job, but you might be better off at McDonald’s. It’ll pay more for the same hours in most places. A lot of the cashiers are young kids that don’t like to really work. They can be unreliable coworkers. There are plenty of hours to grab but again the pay per hour is pretty small considering other similar jobs pay more."
bad,I worked here for nearly two years and i was promised on multiple occasions that i would be getting advanced or a change to advance. It never happened. My store switched managers and i had to essentially plead my case for the advancement i was promised.
bad,"Job was decent but during the time i worked there the pay was low for their duties, plus i hated the fact of how much food a supermarket waste daily and weekly and none is given away to the homeless or needy."
bad,If they dont like you they dont want you their. They have the favorite people and if your not that then they try to replace you or cut your hours. The management is horrible and their lazy and try to blame other people for their mistakes.
bad,"This place is going downhill and fast. In the short amount of time that I worked there, about 5 people had quit. There were often too many things left to do by management and not enough time or people to complete. I would not recommend it unless you're desperate."
bad,"The store manager was not very professional; she would not speak to people and employees in a good, positive, professional manner.  I had a fake nose ring in and the store manager would get furious that I had it in; there were 3 or 4 other cashiers whom had real nose rings in and they did not have to take theirs out.  I thought that was funny.  "
bad,"At Weis Markets, I work on a team of 6 Programmer/Analysts and we are expected to support 6 systems which includes bug fixes, user support and continuing development.  It is not possible for 6 people to adequately support 6 systems.  Weis never does adequate Business Analysis/Requirements gathering prior to beginning development.  Developers are constantly reworking code as requirements change and the scope of the project grows.  It is the culture here to jump into projects unprepared and let the programmers write code over and over until the requirements are ironed out.  We usually go live with underdeveloped systems because the up-front work was not done."
bad,"all management is concerned is bonus , that includes store management and corporate managers. cut hours all store are being run a minimum staff. the associates work 2 to 3 people jobs because of staff hours being cut on a daily basis."
bad,"worked the cash register,stocked shelves when not busy.just how to work the cash register.Management,not great they made clicks and stayed at the 1st register and i was always at the end where it was cold.hardest part was sorry nothing i was there for only  four months,i had to leave for rotator cuff surgery.Enjoyable part the beginning i worked the tour for schools two times,sold the most easter eggs, working  on giving free samples of different things away."
bad,No comment on working conditions at Weis Markets.  They treated me well for a very long time.  I did not realize the grass was actually green on the other side of the fence.  Just no opportunity to grow at Weis.
bad,The work was mindless and the environment was not very professional.  Coworkers were fun to work with but extensive work for very little compensation for it.
bad,"part time job "
bad,The environment at Weis Markets is poor and unexciting. The workplace is quite exhausting. The managers care very little about one's improvement in the store.
bad,"While the atmosphere is generally low stress and friendly, the ratio between what the company expects from their employees and the compensation they are willing to offer is severely off. Part time employees are expected to do the same amount of work as full time employees at wages way below those offered by competitors. Advancement is difficult. Previous experience means nothing. Their job openings on the website advertise for full time positions, however they will ONLY hire at the part time level. Their ""deals"" are not only difficult for the customer to understand but also for the employee to explain."
bad,"Usually when I came into work, I'd sometimes be rushed to clock in when I come in early also when I come in, there are nobody working because people call off and they don't find replacements.I learned only customer service and communicating with customers on my own. Management is very disorganized and they show high favoritism towards certain employees. They do not know how to treat employees with respect either. The hardest part about this job was customer service; handling western union transactions when they were to get mistakes on it. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around other co-workers bonding with them and the weekly pay."
bad,"Working in pharmacy is difficult, plain and simple. That said, it can be rewarding. Working at Weis Pharmacy was exhausting and overwhelming, but being able to help certain patients made it worth while. That said, the pay was terrible, close to minimum wage, and the job required a skill set that should have entitled employees to much higher compensation."
bad,Granted this was my first job it was not the best experience. It started you off with minimum wage and at the time that was 7.25 and I did not even get decent hours. The hardest part of the job was the fact that the job was understaffed not many people working so the customers were very unhappy. The only good part of the job was the friendly management.
bad,Was part time but didn't even get part time hours. Was called in then sent home. Was not professional about the work place.
bad,It has been over 10 years since I have been at that place. Can't  tell how the ace is run at this time anymore. You a plus have to ask someone who has been  there since I  left.
bad,"Packaged Seafood and meat products, stocking shelves and corner end caps. Arranged merchadising, promoting sales and advertising products. Setting up fresh fish display, displaying Sampling items occasionally for customers to try, take products off shelves if older as they were marked down in price or half off original price. Shrink products or damaged products daily. Take inventory of products, change dept sale tags once a week as sale changes."
bad,"A job that has to deal with customers in a kind way. Not always a good working environment , but it wasn't a bad job. I stood for a four hour period and I didnt mind that. There were also 10 min breaks that went by faster and they are constantly in need for work. Decent hour were given to me as well."
bad,Low pay and since I was part-time I was given minimal hrs.  Most hrs. went to family of employees that have worked there for years.
bad,"The atmosphere and people are not positive which affects the way other people work and customer satisfaction. The hardest part of the job is working with the old cashier/computer equipment. If you were to accidentally scan an item twice, you would have to call the manager or supervisor over to override the item. This process makes things slow and the lines get longer; and customers get irritated."
bad,"Patience, Lifting,Busy,co-workers attitudes,I love my job,very poor higher up management never appraise or giving anything extra for a good job or anything its all them not employees.Hardest part of job when busy no extra help or even a thank-you."
bad,"The workplace environment is not that great. Management expects everything to get done with no help. Management in stores pretty much don't do anything but look down on you. Managers should be personable to their employees, yet they act like they care but look at their phones while talking to you. Makes a lot of sense to me!!!"
bad,Meh. Not that good. Kinda bad. A lot of snot nosed prima-donna high schoolers that didn't understand the concept of a job.
bad,"Managament could care less about you, made some good friends, low pay"
bad,"Very poor management. As a stock clerk I was asked to order the store because the manager didn't want to stay past their leave time, even on a salary base pay. Another manager would stay in his office all day and occasionally get up to complain about something then go back. The other stock clerks and I, dealt with customer complaints/questions. The right amount of freight was never ordered because the manager who ordered it tried to get it over as quickly as possible. Managers took a smoke break every 30 minutes. We were allowed 2 short breaks a day. Hours cut randomly. Not a stable income. I had to pick up a second job. Because I showed I can work harder than my co-workers they expected me to do twice the work and allow them to slide by. Had to fight for a 15 cent raise for months even though it's supposed to be mandatory."
bad,There are so many upper management people no one knows who they are answering to. Very poor communication. Some managers are nice but others speak to employees in a condescending manner. Managers play favorites and not all employees are expected to follow the same workplace rules. The Human Resources department is awful to work with. You’re lucky if someone actually answers their phone and/or returns your phone call
bad,"The work isn't bad but they don't pay accordingly. The management is also a revolving door. 6 Years and 5 store managers is not something you should see at any store. All managers quit for better jobs. If the company cant keep the highest payed person (over $100,000yr)  then they most be doing something wrong. also if you go into management you most be able to relocate"
bad,Management could use improvement. Most people dont stay more than 3 months. Great pay for the area but little to no advancement they play favorites and with it being incredibly physical it's not hard to become injured on the job especially when you have to step over pallets and your foot goes through. Overtime is mandatory and you will almost always start working on night shift and takes usually about a year to get enough seniority to get off nights assuming a day shift position opens.
bad,"My position..."
bad,"I worked at store #191 in Gap, PA for just over six months. I was quickly elevated to a Service Desk Representative because I was a hard worker that strove to give customers high level service on the Front End. However, things quickly went downhill."
bad,"A typical day at work would be coming in, going into the customer service box taking care of customers, examples being playing lottery/cashing lottery tickets, bill pay, send/receive western union."
bad,The front-end is under staffed. We don't receive anything extra when coming in on days off. The hours are very inconsistent. Part-timers get scheduled more than 6 hours multiple days a week. Our breaks are only 10 mins. We only get 1 break in a day plus a bathroom break. Management is unhelpful. Communication from management is poor. The only part of my job I enjoy anymore is my coworkers.
bad,The customers were straight up Bs always complaining about everything in the store like if you don’t like it then go somewhere else I couldn’t deal with them and then always blaming me like I did something wrong I had to Quit they was driving me crazy
bad,"Honestly, I only worked here for a few months because I had to get a job quick to pay my bills and I knew it was gonna be short termed. First was that the hiring process takes too long. It took me about 3 weeks to get in because there’s only 1 person you had to work around their schedule to come in to get a drug test and then you had to wait for that to come back. Then, my first day was kinda cold. I immediately felt like an outsider and nobody came to help me with the training videos when it wasn’t working. I had to get someone else to help me and they had no clue what to do either. As far as my time was there, I didn’t like management at all. I think that’s what’s lacking and they play favorites all the time. I always felt like a bother when I asked for help and even if I called for help it took long especially if I had a whole line of customers waiting. There were times I actually cried because management handled things so horribly and I got written up for not being “politically correct” and I just felt that the customer had no place to pull that on me. As soon as I found another job, there was one manager in particular that bullied me and the last week there, I worked an 8 hour shift and got no lunch break. The customers were great just hated the management"
bad,The company is a friendly place to work for. They are flexible with your schedule. The are willing to train you in different areas if you want succeed
bad,Not the best job bad management and not taken seriously. Too much drama and managers will pick at you if your not constantly working. Not aloud to just stare off to space when no one is there.
bad,Apparently Weis does not believe in family first or set days off if you are full-time. Guess people are not allowed to have a life while employed with them.
bad,"Typically you would wash dishes , slice meat and cheese, customer service, clean slicers, make food such as hoagies, pizza, Strombolis, moping and sweeping floors, restocking shelves,"
bad,One of the worst jobs that I ever had.  Was not thrilled with the lack of training and how they just throw employees into a position and expect them to know what they are doing.
bad,The produce section was a mess. They had only a few workers and wouldnt hire anyone else for that position. No one stayed there long and people quit in a hurry
bad,"I took a job at Weis due to the location being convenient to my house and that's all...I've been working for the company for a month now and I plan on resigning soon as I find another job...The managers are all clueless and unprofessional...The job isn't terrible, but dealing with the public isn't for me, and the pay neither...A billion dollar business, and pay their workers little to nothing...That is just sad SMH! Working for Weis definitely wont pay your bills that's for sure! If you are desperate and need a job then apply, but I'd say dont waste your time and work for a better company!"
bad,"A day at work is just like any other, over and over. You learn how to smile through gritted teeth to the customers at first, and then to your managers. Then you learn that all of management are best friends, so you hope you don't have any problems with them. The hardest part of the job is the humiliation you're forced to face, people can be cruel when they know you have no way of defending yourself. The most enjoyable part of the job is picking up your paycheck on payday. "
bad,Weis Markets is a great family owned business that believes in giving back to the community and maintaining local relevance in store offerings.  A very committed company to end customer base and operations.
bad,"being a cashier is a good starting job. it teaches social skills and team work. however, i would not recommend the job necessarily. i feel as though there are better first jobs."
bad,Management needs to have a better sense on who their strong players are. Too many people get rewarded for poor work. Impossible to discipline employees.
bad,The most enjoyable part of this job is getting to know new people and some of the nice co workers you will deal with. There is no room for advancement and there is a lot of favoritism.
bad,"The company itself was decent, but the store I worked in was horrible. Store manager had her favorites and employees did not pay any attention to their department supervisor because they went straight to the store manager."
bad,Weis's Corporate office has a lot to be desired. Passages are long and narrow and there are very few windows around to be able to get a way from work for a moment. Training is more of an on the job training which causes a tough challenge for a recent college graduate.
bad,"management sucks. most customers are nice, others are not and might try and get you fired for stupid stuff. only part-time, $9/hr Monday-Saturday and $10/hr on Sundays. no fixed schedule - you work different days every week and different hours almost everyday. and no more than 34 1/2 hours a week"
bad,an ok job. mainly for school kids. hours were bad. management was poor. some were very unprofessional. only good thing was getting paid weekly. but the hours were trash
bad,"Made a move to come to the Weis Markets family from a small family run butcher. Management was difficult to say the least. Work days were super slow to crazy busy. Only man in the deli department, extremely difficult! Hardest part of the day was the uphill battle with management. Will not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"I thought Giant Markets was bad, until Weis came along. They mislead the public thinking all the Giant employees would stay on for a long time, but eventually they terminated most of the full timers. Also they phased out over time products the public were used to when it was the Giant; that's what kept them coming. Now I hear from many people that they do not shop at Weis unless absolutely necessary."
bad,"The job typically requires you to multitask daily.   Some of the management can be challenging.  The hardest part of the job is running the facility on the given budget.  I thoroughly enjoy managing my associates to develop and maintain a team concept, creating solutions that provide value to the customer and the employer and dissecting reports to maximize profitability."
bad,"Weis, not unlike most retailers, cares about their bottom line first and foremost, this is felt in many ways but the associates at store level and is a huge drain on overall morale and creates an unusually high employee turnover. I am hoping to find a company that recognizes hard work, dedication and honesty in an employee."
bad,Management is a joke at this store. If you don't know anyone in the store you're the target to be their scapegoat. Everything gets blamed on you even if you do everything you are told.
bad,I was wrongfully terminated and also was not given the opportunity to grow within the company. The manager's were very biased and paid no attention to customer reviews.
bad,"Workers are generally angry because of management not seeming to care about them. There are so many ""random checkups"" that it stresses the employees. Not many workers pull their own weight in comparison to someone that wants to go and get the job done. Many employees slack off and do not do what they need to do in a timely manner. Management attempts to find new ways to motivate the employees but many of the employees do not care. It makes the workplace toxic and taxing on an employee that wants to go above and beyond. It does not seem too difficult to put a smile on your face and wait on a customer and have a pleasant experience in customer service. However, many of the employees and management do not seem to be able to comprehend this simple task. The hardest part of the job was trying to motivate coworkers that were on my same level to do a better job. It was difficult to tip-toe around not hurting their feelings while I still wanted to get the point across to do something faster or better. Many times I found myself just doing that person's task as well as my own so that the work would be completed correctly and timely. The most enjoyable part was the customer service and creating a pleasant interaction between business and the normal person."
bad,The job was a simple job don't expect I wouldn't expect much it is a grocery store after all. If you want to advance in the company and make it a career state that as soon as possible(first day or first week)
bad,I like the company and the people I worked with but my store manager was after me and didn't like me at all. I learned to work with other and to work as a team. My favorite part about it was meeting other managers and learning a lot about them. I loved to bake and cake decorate.
bad,"Cashier entitled:"
bad,In Weiss Markets i worked in many different areas. I wanted to grow in the compant but just was not what i wanted. Some co-workers were great and some were not.
bad,"Fun job tasks, talking, greeting people and stacking shelves. I learned job promotion would be exciting. Poor management later told me that many people I had worked with got fired including the manager.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with misconduct behavior. The most enjoyable part of the job would be meeting great people who would appreciate me."
bad,The most important thing to the managers are numbers. If you are not keeping up with what is expected of you then there’s no place for you. The flexibility in hours is entirely dependent on how much you push for your hours to change. They are not immediately compliant unless you threaten to leave.
bad,When I first started off at Weis I was so excited I was 18 years old and they only paid $9.00 an hour and it was every week. But the thing is the management at the time sucked they was stealing money and making it seem like the workers were or that they aren't handling the money properly. And some of the decent managers were leaving who use to help you.
bad,Weis was on ok place to work. The pay was good but non understanding management werent. I would recommend it to others but only if it was a last resort.
bad,"Work pace can vary wildly, it is retail. Your in store managers can range from great to outright awful, it varies wildly. District management is typically very friendly but a real pain in the butt. Corporate is completely lost at times, they don't have a handle on what they are doing. You can have some really great co workers thought. You aren't paid too well, but its not as bad as it could be. Managers make an ok amount of money, but the salaried ones get worked to death with a minimum of 50 hours per week that can range all the way to 100 if a store is really in a jam. Constant cuts to part time hours are a major problem and schedules vary wildly with the new computer scheduling program. Its, a job and you can move up and do alright for yourself, you'll just have to be willing to work crazy hours and really get worked to death. Not a great place but there are worse jobs."
bad,"Unless you planned to stay to relocate or travel, there was no real benefit to advancement. Scheduling was awful and for the amount of work there weren't always enough people to handle the job at night."
bad,Many things are out of the norm from the favoritism to the lack of fatigue and flow of pick protocol to fully cross training all employees not just the management favorites that spend about 4 hours actually working out of a 8 to 10 hour day !
bad,I worked in a rough part of town. Everyday we had shoplifters and very angry customers. There is nothing management can really do about it because of corporate.
bad,Long established company. Department I worked in is unorganized and reactionary to every challenge. Company has expanded too fast. Never work there again.
bad,"Had more senior level executives coming through in the last five years as the company is still figuring out who they want to become."
bad,The rules they have in place make it impossible for the working day to run smoothly. They hire incompetent people and expect the other competent employees to fully train them in 4 hours.
bad,"Every week you get a check for doing random tasks in the department. stocking, prep work and anything else that the managers do not want to do themselves like cleaning. Management is mostly productive but they do not care about the working men or women. This job must be temporary or you will never advance in the company unless you stay with them years at minimum wage."
bad,"Love the people I work WITH, not so much the people I work FOR. Management is horrible, it's gotten too corporate over the years. The store I worked at used to be a ""King's"".. Ever since changing to Weis Markets, it's gone downhill."
bad,"A typical overnight shift at the Grocery Store consists of either a self explanatory 'freight' night (unloading truck and stocking shelves), or a non-freight night, where all backstock is worked onto the shelves, and all store merchandise is fronted and properly displayed. The co-workers were friendly and easy to work with, however from time to time, communication from higher management down seemed a bit muddled. Otherwise, is was great for a part-time job for earning a little extra money each week."
bad,"Because of the poor management conditions of this supermarket, Many days become more complicated then they are supposed to be. As a monitor you will fix issues with registers as well as pricing, audit cashiers, teaching cashiers, and closing the front end at the end of the workday. Management will either not schedule enough individuals resulting in complaints and lack of customer satisfaction as of lately. The most enjoyable part of the days is the cashiers and other employees. Most employees are happy individuals and attempt there best with what is provided for them."
bad,"At the store I worked at, a lot was expected of me and I often did other peoples jobs. Short staffing was very common and our managers were unprofessional."
bad,"Damned if you do, damned if you don't workplace.  Understaffed department, but we were still expected every item on our ridiculously long task list done. No overtime allowed, so it was pretty much expected that we work off the clock every day.  "
bad,"Working at Weis is a fairly normal job. You clock in, do your work, clock out. The persons around you are very kind and sweet. Fellow cashiers, cleaning persons are all very nice. The management is a different story. "
bad,Everyday is a stressful day working at Weis Markets. They never schedule enough help during the daytime. I would never recommend working as a receiver to anyone. The job is full of frustration. Not good for your health.
bad,"If you have a problem and try to ask management like District managers and HR managers it can take a long time for it to be fixed. I was supposed to get a pay raise in October 2017 for working with Weis for a year, I still haven't received the pay increase. I emailed the district manager in the first week of December 2017 and it is February 7th and I have yet to get a pay increase. Also if you pay goes up with minimum wage don't expect a pay increase for working with them for more than a year.  Also not much room for advancement. One of the only good things is being able to talk to coworkers throughout the day, makes the day go by faster."
bad,The management at the store is the best It's just the corporation as a whole that is horrible the don't pay you any money I would only recommend it if it's a last option
bad,"Great place to start as a manager/Asst Mgr.Regional VP clueless to Customer service and Employee needs.Chain builds a nice culture as a whole.Very successful company that does not allow its stores to manage upwards,everything ie managed down.District Managers hands are tied when dealing with quick change in the market place to compete,"
bad,"Weis is a grocery store with a wide variety of products. They could have more organics/gluten free options, tho they are bettering with that day by day."
bad,"A typical day at Weis Markets would consist of many customers shopping in the store. The opening time is at six in the morning until eleven at night. To be honest, I learned that judgmental people in the management department makes it difficult for employees to do their job correctly. The management was terrible and my co-workers were pleasant. The hardest part of my job was talking to management and the most enjoyable part of my job was my lunch break."
bad,you will have your typical days at work but management can be better.
bad,Unload and stock frozen food on shells I'm in the produce area you had to rotate and put up new produce and to make shelves are stocked and organized and to be in charge when the manager wasn't there which I should never took the job video
bad,Too many people at the top that have no idea what its like at the bottom. They don't pay enough or offer enough hours for adults to make a living. So all they ever get are school kids who don't care.
bad,"In a day of work, I do many things from answering phone calls to dealing with customer complaints. I learned how to do many things in the almost 2 years I have worked there. My manager and co workers are very easy to work with and get along with . The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people, and our customers."
bad,"The management is petty, and immature. They talk about employees in a rude and lewd manner that is completely inappropriate. The work was easy, and even fun at times. I enjoyed the people I worked with. However, the starting pay is low, and raises are low. There are no hours, and while management gets weekends off, everyone else is expected to work."
bad,Checkout customers when they are ready. Help customers find items if they cannot find them. Greet customers when they come in the store and when they leave the store. My job is also to put out candy when it comes in. And to front and face the coolers by the registers.
bad,it was fun first job to have and was very flexible hours and the managers where nice but as time went on the pay rate was not enough to support me and its a good place to start
bad,"My time spent at Weis Markets wasn't exemplary of the brand's otherwise respectful reputation. Poor management at the time of my employment resulted in greatly reduced workflow efficiency, ignoring safety protocols,  and hard hits to overall morale. Some management even verbally or indirectly abused other good, hardworking employees. Others were seriously injured from simple oversights that could've easily been prevented. It even got to a point where many of us were crying during our shift behind the back wall just to make it through the day. No one in the department I worked in is still employed there, as we all terminated our employment at about the same time (as well as many others from all other departments)."
bad,The company didn't off adequate time off... You worked 364 days a year to include holidays unless you had scheduled vacation time off. They had No On-call rotation so you were on-call every weekend.
bad,"I enjoyed working as a fryer cook. every day I had to make sure that I had the Spicy Chicken Wings, Onion Rings, Chicken Tenders, Popcorn Chicken, Chicken Sandwiches, Potato Wedges out on the floor 3 hours."
bad,"Good for people looking in dire need of a job and can’t find one anywhere else, decent starting pay at first. Usually close to home. Do not really get within promotions ever."
bad,"I used to shop there all the time before getting hired there and liked it. I was there for a little bit and realized all the secret things that used to happen behind closed doors. I didn't approve of a lot of things I saw and management never did anything to fix it and wanted to be ""buddy buddy"" with the employees to make piece at work then being a boss like they should be."
bad,Just transitioned from Mars to Weis. No one was prepared. The managers had no idea what they were doing. It was a very stressful place to work.
bad,Decent I guess don't really like overnight jobs but a job is a job I guess. It is alright it could be better but if you like stocking shelves and working over nights then I guess it's the job for you.
bad,My job is a very busy fast paced position.  There is always something to do.  Hardest part of my job is unloading trucks while more people are coming in to get checked in but I make it work.  My vendors are awesome and the people that I work with are a part of my family. I couldn't ask for better co-workers.
bad,I would take orders for birthdays and special occasions. I used a air brush to do some of the designs. I would also pull bread for the bread to be baked that day.
bad,"In general it is a good place to work. They are willing to adjust scheduling to meet employee needs such as for school, or vacation in the summer.  The associates and managers are very friendly to speak to. However just like any business they try to cut costs to make a profit, but sometimes they do that foolishly in my opinion but cutting payroll on times where they should be adding hours for example on holiday weeks, food-stamp days, or on senior citizen days. In reality if they had more staff on, more customers would shop and there would be more profit."
bad,Had to collect carts all day. Was supposed to go collect carts even though it was thunder storming outside. Nothing was enjoyable about this job.
bad,"Weis Markets was fun in the beginning but turned bad very quickly. I hated working towards the end and in all honesty, they made me have very bad depression and anxiety. I would not recommend working there."
bad,Very aggressive and not at all understanding of employees lives... not recommended for new parents
bad,"I was offered a management position once hired but I was never trained properly. They ended up shifting my into positions they needed filled and only trained with in the company. "
bad,"got to meet new people"
bad,terrible management. very disappointed in the amount of hours i had.
bad,Work is easy but benefits and hourly wages are extremely low.
bad,"When i clock in at Weis Markets i typically start off by doing what needs to be done in grocery. As the day progresses i can end up helping out the front end by going on register, going to dairy and stock the milk and fill any gaps in the shelves, fixing up the shelves in frozen department, and much more. I learned at weis that i'm capable of working hard. I also learned what i expect from myself as an employee and if i don't reach that expectation i find a way to do so. The hardest part of the job was being able to maintain several different departments."
bad,"Stock shelves, order inventory, customer service, general cleaning"
bad,"Shift consists of breaking down pallets from the truck, loading them onto carts, and then stocking that freight to the shelves. This job taught me how to work more efficiently and interact with customers. Fantastic managers, very friendly and helpful to both customers and employees. However, there is a very glaring issue with corporate and how hard work is not rewarded at all. Once I completed my 90 days, I was supposed to get a 50 cent raise but it never happened. Corporate said it was ""done away with"" but others had gotten this very recently in the past. This has also happened to multiple other people before, some not even getting backpay once getting the 50 cent raise. If you work hard, look into a different company."
bad,"I had a great team and fairly good store. The region changed, and we inherited a pretty cut throat regional manager and assistant district manager. They never had anything nice to say and were always negative. Weis does not offer the labor for your department to be perfect every single day. They are constantly cutting hours,however store conditions most always be perfect. They constantly take more of your life and you don't want to move up to store management because it gets worse. Weis is lacking communication, good leadership, and time unity. I saw the writing on the wall and got out in the nick of time. They do pay well or did before they took overtime and the pay scales way back. The corporate office is real shady and never takes blame for anything. I don't see myself ever going back to that working environment."
bad,The position was ok. The wage was fair and the working conditions were satisfactory. I enjoyed the work. I had issues with management and we had personality conflicts.
bad,"Weis Markets is a decent place to work, the pay is poor, and the management is terrible, but overall it's not a bad work environment. The tasks at hand are easy, and the staff are friendly."
bad,Constant hours and pay...have to be hard working...no guarantee you have a job the next day
bad,"Very busy days,smile always.Taking care of customers.Management is always changing, workplace is very stressful, hardest part of job for me was trying to hard to make everyone happy,"
good,"socked shelves bagged groceries gathered carts,maintained property  moped up mesas"
good,"Checking out customers, counting money. Stocking shelves, news papers, assisting customers to cars & loading groceries."
good,"the management was terrible, workplace culture was not something id like to be around, hardest part was dealing with customers who think they're right, most enjoyable was working with other coworkers"
good,n steel in front of management and they do nothing about it i should be able to go in turn my self scans on instead of stocking the bags fill register paper and clean the floors
good,"Do not like working here. Management is a joke and they over work you. They do not care about your wishes and yell at you if you want a day off but some people who barely work live the life and never get yelled at, but if you work a lot of hours then you basically aren't allowed to have a life."
good,"I love to work. I love the job I do. Sometimes I feel like management don't manage the store properly. My department suffers because of unreliable people, and they don't seem to be getting rid of the problem, but would rather lose the hard workers in the department. This has been an on-going problem for quite sometime. This store will shut down, as previous store have, because of this issue, and the management team are not taking the steps to run the store or departments the way they should be run. This is why our sales are down. This store suffers for multiple reasons, but this is the number 1 reason why."
good,Grocery stockers get paid the least and worked the hardest. Unfair double standards. Other departments stand around and talk all day but in grocery you're not even allowed to talk while working.
good,"It can be a stressful job at times, especially with drama. However, if you are looking for a job for after school or over the summer only it isn't a horrible place to work."
good,A typical day at the job would be coming in with a positive attitude and ready to work. I learned that there will be times where you do not want to work but its always worth it when the customers leave with a great experience. Management have their moments but they always kn ow what is best for business. The hardest part about the job is trying to get work days off.
good,"Working at weis was a decent experience. The manager of my dept. was super great. The store managers were very pushy, wanting to get things moving/done asap. The job tasks themselves were not very difficult."
good,"I was always one to take a photo of my schedule the minute it was printed out, and my schedule was constantly changed without my knowledge. Often, I'd be awakened on a day off to ask if I was coming in because my name was suddenly on the schedule. After the third time of this happening, I decided to leave."
good,Family members also worked with the managers. Alot of favoritism. Not able to advance in job because family were taught new skills for better pay and management positions. Hardest part was watching family members of my managers be able to sit around and do nothing while I was picking up the extra slack.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of serving customers at the deli counter, cleaning the equiptment and dealing with cash and cedit payments on occasion. I learned how to better deal with difficult customers and overall become more social in the workplace. The management overall was mediocore. Some of my co workers were great and taught me alot. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the more difficult customers, but the most enjoyable was meeting different people and working as a team with my co workers."
good,"It can range from running cash register the whole shift to doing carts,cleaning bathrooms/ spills, doing trash, recycling ,returns, filling register/ catalina/paper towels and bags at all registers filling the Weis product fridge. I didn't really learn to much there, I get along with pretty much all coworkers, theirs not really a hard part of my job, and the most enjoyable part is the cart shifts I have because I get to help out at most departments when I have finished my list of things to do."
good,it was not a bad place to work but your co workers who have been there forever are very judgemental and make you feel like an outsider the boss is like most dont care much about you just get it done the job  is easy but the people suck coustomers are rude
good,"I like this position because I work mainly by myself, I enjoy working with numbers. My co-workers are easy to get along with and to talk to."
good,"I worked at my local Weis for 5 years as a cashier, monitor, and customer service represenative. My managers were always rude and would toss work onto my cashiers and coworkers on our front end. Other departments would blame our front end for customer returns and customer complaints about their departments. I felt overwork and exhausted working 3:30pm to 12am almost everyday. I felt no sense of accomplishment or thrill to be at work."
good,"not a bad place to work but not paid enough, only have 1 break if you run register and to many teenagers on their cell phones working there and family members working together"
good,My job specifically was not hard and I was hardly supervised. Communication between coworkers was a huge chore. The only way I could ask for assistance from a fellow coworker was via phone and even then it was rare that they would come out to the kiosk to help assist me with a customer. The management also kept overloading the gas station with merchandise to the point that the township told them they weren't allowed to block the lanes for the pumps.
good,"I enjoyed being a cashier at weis, the customers were always very nice and understanding for the most part. Sometimes i would see the same faces weekly, and leaned some of their names. The management was polite but did not work with days off very well."
good,The place operate slow which makes it hard and it take a toll on you when max hours are 33 to 34 and it difficult to maintain the cost of living when those hours are not guaranteed
good,"no guarantee of weekly hours. Started at 32 hrs and was dropped to 19 hours."
good,Poor management skills and lack of communication leads to poor moral. Employees voice was rarely ever heard. In order to advance one must be transferred to a different store. Benefits were costly and covered next to nothing
good,Store managers are nasty. Not enough hired help. No advancement. Worked 9 days straight. Can't get a drink or eat. Dehydrated workers. Poor management
good,The immediate management was very effective and very friendly.  However they were always scrambling to holes from one end of the district to another.  The upper management had a hands of policy and very rarely intervened with the pharmacist.
good,The work days starts with spitting chicken and making sandwiches. Then we move on to making pizzas along with other baked goods.
good,A typical day at work was very busy. Management was alright. Co-workers were great. The hardest part of this job was standing up for eight hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers.
good,"For an employee of Weis Markets some of us find ourselves overwhelmed with a flurry of activity. Between assisting customers, taking responsibilities off of other team members because they are unable to complete the tasks themselves or are unwilling to, and unloading trucks, one may find themselves quite overworked and unappreciated. However, when looking for a clean and sanitary environment look no further than the Produce department! We clean the displays, sanitize them, and freshly stock them one to three times a day, and freshen the stock regularly throughout the day, making sure only the best produce is put out at all times. The old produce is disposed of if it it isn't able to be utilized for something else, and a log is kept of the waste product. The cooler is kept clean as well, and all of the equipment is sanitized after every use. "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of a lot of baking and seeing that products were ready for the waiting customer. I have learned a lot of management skills and how to deal with co-workers and their issues. The hardest part of my job was multitasking, you had to take care of many issues at one time. On the same token this was enjoyable to me. I enjoyed multitasking."
good,I liked my job and the people I worked with but the pay was not worth all the jobs I actually took on.
good,Spend most of your time walking around instead of actually working. It’s really boring it makes u question why work there.management could be rude at times but nothing anyone can’t handle
good,typical day at work was being a front end manager and cashier. Managing money and counting each drawer at the end of each work shift. Making sure lunch breaks are covered and each customer is satisfied with each purchase.
good,"The company is great it was just bad management when I worked there ."
good,"A typically work day was preparing food, stocking, and customer service What i learned was even if you did your job you still get yelled at. The manager (leader) for my department is horrible. She got into my face and slammed the desk at me. Everyone that worked in my department before me, left a couple months after starting because of the leader and other associate. The hardest part of the job job is  dealing with the leader and the other associates. The best part of the job is working with the food and helping customer and getting to talk to the mest associates."
good,Management at the new store was good until they transferred everyone different places. Workplace culture as good and equal. Typical day was running self checkout and helping customers.
good,"Typical day was in front of a computer and work like robots"
good,"would not work there again. slave drivers the lot of them."
good,"Whilst my direct manager, the overnight manager, knew what would help and assist the store I worked at, the other managers, mainly the main store manager and the grocery manager caused the store many problems. Favoritism was shown for many of the dayside members, even the receiver was allowed exemption from many of their job requirements for no good reason. Major changes were placed upon the night crew members without consulting them or even the night managers. Unnecessary micro-management was also put in place that only served to decrease work flow and reduce productivity. Overall I would not reccomend others to work the same position I did at the same establishment, and I recognize that not all establishments are the same."
good,"different departments generate different income.  the bakery department does not generate as much as the deli, for example.  therefore the bakery doesn't get as many hours for the employees as the deli.  the bakery department staff works HARD.  work is absolutely NEVER done and there is always work leftover/to be caught up.  at the time I worked there, staff was NOT properly trained.   the Front Street location is a training location.  not only do we have to keep the store stocked, but train new employees as well.  The person who does the hiring needs to be replaced."
good,If they paid better and had more concern for their employees they could probably keep help on board.  They need to up their pay schedules so they can keep  mature productive workers.
good,It was a basis of if you had a good relationship with management you got more hours.. my hours were cut which lead to issues. I was a new hire and never got more than three days a week
good,"There's not really an opportunity for advancement in this corporation, their pay scale is ridiculous and unfair, they offer no benefits unless you're full time but they don't offer full time positions, and management is perplexing."
good,"Bad managers, nothing offered for part time employee's, sales driven hours. You want to support your self or family don't bother. "
good,If you are looking for something steady this company is nit the place. They are always hiring can not keep employees. In owingsmills maryland.  So if you want to apply for them go ahead me personally working st the one in owingsmills is not worth the stress that will be brought on.
good,"I worked at Weis for two years in the Deli department, and we had many complications. Managers are unwilling to communicate, and typically take sides when it comes to altercations, etc., I do not recommend working here, in any department."
good,This job was terrible i worked hard and never got any promotions. I learned every position in the store and got moved to the Beer department where i exceed everything that was expected of me i also became a Supervisor where i didnt get any raise for my hard work. I didnt quit i stay i continue hoping to get a good yearly raise so a year comes around and my Manager love my work so much she sabotage my yearly review by giving me a bad review because she found i was gonna great a promotion moved to another to be a Manager of a store for the beer department and didnt want lose me. So at the end of this i didnt get a raise which would have helped me out because i was only getting paid $9.00 a hour. I still didnt quit i continue to work and i gave Weis a two weeks notice. I found a better job the manager of the didnt try to keep a good worker who never called out. All he said was sometimes its the job love and not about the money. Which is crazy because if that was not the case why is he the manager who gets paid a huge salary. After a week of him asking me to say i did and i continue to do a good job making sure all our customers was happy. But at the end of this would never recommend anyone to work from this company they dont value their employees at all.
good,"was a good first job, learned a lot on food prepping, not the greatest mangers in the world, fast pace work, was not always acuminating for life out side of work, they wanted everyone to live a weis"
good,It was just really disorganization that really got me at this job management wasn't really staying in top of the ordering so it was impossible to work the back stock in the back room plus the hours sucked only getting 18 hours at the most
good,"Weis Markets is an easy and friendly place to work, they work around my weird schedule. "
good,disorganized or absent management. little room for growth. constant employee turn around. disorganized leadership of different departments.
good,"This job was my first job, so yes it was exciting, but a career.  Working with customers on a daily basis, and learning to deal with customer issues, at a young high school age."
good,"I did NOT like this company. The job as a Deli Associate was an OK position but the management really, i felt, didn't appreciate their employees. I wasn't able to call of if needed due to a limited amount of employees. So when i did have emergencies the company would be out of an Deli Associate for the time being. I would NEVER work for this company EVER again in life."
good,"-Wait for the customer to come into your lane and check them out as quickly as possible."
good,i worked here when i was in school so its an okay job not for me. i did learn more about how to prepare different salads
good,"learned how to handle people and there anger , co workers were very nice and helpful"
good,"No other job seekers this company, do to that I only had to jobs which was Wendy’s & Weis. And tbh I can’t really say what other jobs seeker this company because all jobs are different."
good,Flexible hrs pay is horrible easy going environment at times management can be understanding of some situations but can also  be inconsiderate..not sure about benefits
good,"It was an okay place to work. Nice people, good enviroment. Discount was ok. Small store and shared a parking lot with the local Hagerstown Area Community College"
good,"I worked at Weis Markets while I was in high school and to put it simply, it was a job. It paid the average starting wage in my area ($9.00/hour) and I feel like if you were committed to working at this company, you could have eventually moved up after three+ years. It is a simple job that is good for people entering or re-entering the workforce, but if you have any specialty skill, it is not the company for you if you are starting out as a basic associate. There is nothing wrong with the positions, but they are relatively simple and do not work to create valuable work experience and genuine learning. I felt like after working there for two years, I earned nothing more than a few friends, money, a box cutter, and two Weis shirts."
good,"This company while successful is very poorly managed.  People are misplaced in positions. Not promoted on skill and experience, but rather connections, family relationships and friend relationships."
good,"I didn't mind working at Weis Markets, though I feel I was not given enough time to really learn all I needed to know about the position I was given. However, the job itself was labor intensive and I may have simply not been the best fit. I did as best as I could, but in the end they didn't find me to be ""quick enough"" to suit their needs."
good,"cashier, handled checking out customers, bagging groceries, also helped in the customer service desk area, did returns, assisted customers with location of items, lottery, phone work, was lead on cashiers during my shift."
good,I appreciate the knowledge that I gained while working at the Fruit Market. I learned customer service and basic business skills at a young age. These are things that I have kept with me.
good,i am currently doing the job of 3 employees and am limited to 40 hours....i enjoy my job...but do not feel that 40 hours is enough to complete my job as one person.
good,"Usually steady work pace during the week , sundays are the busiest days . Typical day at worm consist of unloading the truck with the freight on it into the back room where the stock crew then breaks the skids down by aisle ."
good,Weis isn’t a bad company to work for.  Manager is very young an doesn’t have much expererance .  He likes to be liked an I’ve been there 20 years an watched dozen of people come an go. I’m not a twenty years old like a group from high school kids.
good,"Weis Markets is financially a great business, but the employees have their up and down days. Everyday there's new and old complications with the machines and customers but we handle them accordingly."
good,"It was a very productive and fast pace environment, co workers are friendly and are willing to help teach you what needs to be taught. However they did have me all over the place working positions I was getting paid to do."
good,Simple jobs that are important but mundane. Poor management and pay. Shifts depend on which store you're at. You can work up to 35 hours if you're part-time but overtime is a myth.
good,"A typical day at work included decorating 20 - 40 cakes for display and sale in the cooler cases, decorating 12-15 dozen cupcakes, mixing icing, designing cakes, consulting with customers to take custom cake orders, baking, and cleaning.  This was a part-time summer job for me.  When I was hired, I clearly stated that I was only available on weekdays.  After 2 summers of employment, the Bakery Manager insisted that I needed to work weekends."
good,Hours were long.  Unorganized and lack of communication.  No team support from other associates.  Management lacked communication skills and wasn't open to constructive criticism.
good,"They'll hire you for part time, but make you work full time, or as close to it so they don't have to give you benefits. Management sucks, coworkers were ok though."
good,"Through my five months at working at the store WEIS, I have met many new people. I usually have a 20 hour work week. On a typical day I find myself cleaning and maintaining the case fullness. I also help out the meat department the best I can. Management does have a good insight on what goes on throughout the store. Although not many people work in the seafood part of the store, my co-workers are always willing to come in on time and help if I am not sure of something. Hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who want something specifically cut from the meat department after the butchers leave."
good,They can be a good place to work for but they require you to work more than 9 hours a day and no time or set schedule with kids.
good,"a typical day was unloading skids from the truck delivery, taking products out to aisles, stocking shelves. i very much enjoyed my co-workers, they were the best part of the job. the hardest part was unloading the truck. i did not like the way it was managed, too many bosses, and no coordination between them."
good,"I would stock all produce stands and rotated stock. I learned ordering, and checking in and out receiving vendors.I learned how to use a motorized walk behind pallet jack. Management was fine to me. Had a great relationship with my produce manager. I got along with everyone. From dairy, frozen, cashiers, etc. Hardest part of my job was stock day. The most enjoyable was during the summer months with the flower tent"
good,Management was bad. Employees were fun to work with. Although I worked on the night crew stocking. There were shenanigans to be had. The pay stunk. But overall the job was above average. It's just the pay wasn't that's why I chose to leave.
good,"A typical work day was cashing customer's out and making sure they were able to find what they were looking for. I learned how to have good customer service skills. Management was ok, I think it could have been a little better with their employee's. The co-worker's were pretty good with helping to understand the store better."
good,"Working here has taught me the way a business works. How things should and should not be done. Also, why certain jobs need to be done in order to maintain a successful business. It also gave me a chance to have additional responsibility in a work environment."
good,The hourly wage is not good for someone who has a family.  The management team will once in a while give you a $ 5.00 gift card for hard work.  The company requires that you work multiple positions without any compensation. They post positions for help and hire for a different area. Some of the management team will say that the hours are flexible but are not. If you complete your job early  you are expected to help other areas without asking you to do so.
good,"Great for students  after school hrs. Great for homemaker trying to earn  some money."
good,The company is great for a second income for older workers looking to supplement their income. It's a great company for students and for younger people who would like to advance in programs they have to make a career here. They however don't have any career advancements for seniors citizens.
good,"Don't plan to go anywhere when employed at the bottom level, they will tend to stretch the dollar you earn out by having store clerks perform manager jobs. Discounts on food products are nice however."
good,"At Weis Markets, they need to be more considerate of their employees. They also need to be more attentive to your needs. This will help both have a working goal."
good,Hours can and will be cut with no warning.  Lots of workload and expected to be done in little time. Short staffed and stressful environment.  Schedules changes every week and hard to request a day off. Every department is short staffed and people are always quitting. No room for growth. Good job for a few extra bucks but don’t make it your only job.
good,Days range from slow paced to fast and hectic depending on current sales or holidays. Management is poor with communication and it's not rare that you'll be called in on your day off or asked to add hours to your shift when you're there. Hours are inconsistent and pay isn't high enough to live comfortably with minimal hours.
good,"A typical day at work consist of get carts, clean bathrooms or what management needed done. I learned not much. The management was horrible and just sat in the office and never helped even when it was super busy and never replaced broken items."
good,"I've worked at three different Weis Stores, so I have experienced great management as well as horrendous manager. All i can truly say  is that the store that I am currently working has an incredibly unrealistic amount of favoritism towards undeserving employees and a high amount of disrespect for employees with strong work-ethic; especially in the deli department."
good,"I've been working there since I was 17(now 20). Enjoyable job as a kid, nothing you can live off of. Holds job for college. If you show you want to work they will work you but do not expect your coworkers to help out"
good,"Not a bad work environment if you're a student. However, the pay is low compared to its competitors. There are examples of favoritism within each store and throughout the company, but it is never talked about or apparent on the surface. "
good,It was fun working for weis but my father took ill i quit to take care of him i am hoping for another chance. I enjoy all of the customers that came threw my line. I made alot of nice friends working for weis i have been with weis ten years. I enjoyed working from 10 in the evening until 7 in the morning that was my best shift. You will get some unhappy customers i got one that right out told me i don't know how to do my job i was asked to get my manager i told them yes i will i locked my register went got the manger we straightened it out
good,"it used to be a good place that i worked in up intill the bar made it a whole different thing, it got so much more fast passed and the the role they forced on me was supposed to be cartpusher but i had to take time that i didnt have to do janitorial work because they were to lay to get a real janitor that wasnt so old with vertigo, i wasnt being paid extra for doing his job and mine."
good,"They work you hard, with only a 10 minute break per  shift. There are almost never enough cashiers making it really hard on self checkout and the cashiers that are working. Many supervisors/managers will just push the person running self checkout to register if it gets backed up(which goes against company policy), basically supervisors and managers are allergic to actually working. They will disappear for hours on end, or will sit in the offices and do nothing while other associates are struggling to keep up. Most store managers also do not know how to work basic equipment on the front end, like register, self checkout, ishop and the service desk. You will most likely know more than your managers after working for 6 or so months. There are no full time positions unless you are a manager. Policy changes happen all the time and there is always mis communication.  There is an extremely high turnover rate, usual due to the fact that management and most jobs suck. Career opportunities seem dim, unless you have a manager that you have some family or friend connection with, otherwise you probably won't get promoted. Self checkout sucks as the allowed weight difference between what the item could weigh is too low, making 75% of your job overriding the machine when it says, ""Unexpected item in bagging area."" Most associates receive 20-30 hours per week dependent upon need, department, and time of year. There are management positions available, although you will have to relocate."
good,"It’s a great place for o get a first job. Getting paid every week is great, but you get paid the bare minimum at $9 an hour. There are no raise being mad no matter how long you’ve been there, and the only time they move you up into a management position is if someone quits and they have to fill it. They only give you a quarter more for doing more work, but you have more hours. There’s never anyone to cover all the shifts so they’re always asking some one of o come in early or stay adt their shift"
good,"The store was stressful to work at, didn't pay well or give much of any raises, and was often managed poorly or unprofessionally. It wasn't the worst job but by no means good to work at."
good,Most of your coworkers are very nice making the work environment bearable most days. Some of the managers are wonderful. Not much of a chance of advancement.
good,"This job was a good experience to take on a little more responsibility than I had before. I handled money, assisted customers, also was in charge of the cashiers, making sure they followed rules and procedures correctly and organized breaks and lunches."
good,"I was told i would be hired at 10/hr on a fast track to promotion, here i am looking for a new job because im still making 9/hr 6 months in.  i have nothing but ""exceeds"" on reviews yet i hear nothing but 'we're working on it' for promotions and raises."
good,"Being a janitor, it was a pretty relaxed, decent job. Could of been better pay and more hours. I cleaned the bathrooms and break room, swept and mopped. Refilled soaps, paper towels, and toilet paper. Also would clean up any messes that were made and clean off shelves. There really wasn't much to the job."
good,The job could of been a very nice job if they union their job more. There weren't any team players and a lot of miscommunication. Sometimes none at all.
good,"People are mostly nice."
good,The training they gave our store when they took over was poor at best. This lead to a miserable work environment for my staff. My manager was worse than most.
good,Weis has a fun high school vibe. I loved working there. However if your looking to work a lot of hours then this isn't the place for you. There are too many workers.
good,It was not a great place to work some of the time. Management  could be a little hard to work for they would be on some of are cases more the others. If they like you you could get away with almost anything. The customer were very pleasant to you for most of the time.
good,"Worked for the company for 3 years and really wanted to get into deli management. Had great co workers and a great deli manager. Customers were great as well.  I helped out and put my all into everything I did. I was even performing management tasks such as: ordering, and monthly inventories. Did one inventory by myself and it was one of the best all year. But all the sudden changes were made. They ended up moving some deli managers around to different stores. Which can be a good thing but not when they bring in a ""trainee"" to be our deli manager.  Senior management did not look at current employees at all. Instead they decided that having a current employee train their new manager would be great idea. VERY INSULTING to say the least. Still trying to wrap my head around that logic. They threw the new ""manager"" in on a day that was an order day and needless to say they didn't know what to do. Why give your all to a company that doesn't appreciate it. I certainly learned that day that it was time to move on. Loved all my co workers but wasn't worth being taken advantage of. "
good,Weis Markets was my first paying job and I think it was a good one to start with. It taught me fundamental communication skills through customer service. I worked at the seafood counter which was a fairly busy department. My co-workers were extremely friendly and easy to  work with. It was difficult to learn all of the item codes as I had no training. The department manager was on vacation when I started and there was no one else to train me. I learned everything on the spot. Management was strict and I was working a steady 38-39 hours a week part time. My favorite part of the job was setting up the fish display case. It gave me a little bit of opportunity to be creative with my work. And I was good at it - I got several compliments from management and the higher ups in the company. It really made me feel good about my work.
good,"I worked many hours and was cross-trained as a stocker and on register. The store managers did not communicate with each other or the department managers very well, which caused confusion in scheduling and daily tasks. The manager who makes the schedule would post the weekly schedule for a day and then change it without notifying anyone, so workers get blamed for not showing up. That was very irritating. They are very understaffed and will work you until you go crazy. Basically, what you are hired for is what you will work, and there's really no opportunity for advancement. However, I will say that I loved my coworkers (other cashiers and stockers.) They are great, and everyone got along well. The grocery sales manager was great and very easy to work with. I wish the upper management was better.  If that was the case, I would have enjoyed working there."
good,"Since the takeover management has turned terrible, some co-workers became terrible, and the system has gotten worst. The workday seems to go by fast, but the breaks are short and you can't go over a certain amount of hours. The most enjoyable part of the job are the customers."
good,"Nice management, nice coworkers, friendly atmosphere. Pay period is weekly which is nice. Scheduling is terrible. When i left i was getting one day a week and only four hours on that day."
good,"You handle money as a cashier all day. There are programs called WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) and CAP (Christian Assistance Program) that are used to purchase food based on the allotted amount on the check(s) presented at the time of checkout. I learned how to perform these specific tasks on a daily basis. You will work with a variety of people throughout your time there. The hardest part of the day is to stand there all day. Also, you don't get quality breaks, and by quality, I mean at least 30 minutes. You only get that if you work for more than 6 hours and 30 minutes. Anything below that, you are granted 1 ten minute break. The most enjoyable part on the job is meeting new people everyday that come through your line."
good,unload freight to the place they go and start putting freight away in an fast and timely fashion and some employees were nice and there were some that were not.
good,"Worked at weis for a good 2 years before having to leave for the military, filled out the paper work for them to legally have to save my positions for at least 6 more years. Got out three years later and there was no record of me ever working there apparently nor my paperwork."
good,Not a company that I would ever work for again.  Although I think it was the store and management team I had and not the company itself.
good,"Weis Markets in general is a very enjoyable place to work. They are nice and flexible with their employees. Not the type of job for a career, but a good starting point for a first time job."
good,Weis markets is an easy job. the management is so so. they like to change their minds a lot. i loved being in contact with the customers.
good,You will be asked to work more hours but can only can go 30 hrs per week and if you are in college your boss may still ask you to come in to cover someone shift I do not mind but to change the schedule with out telling you in disrespectful and then you have to change plans. Management is somewhat disrespectful  and does not care and there is mold in the water fountains  and does not care about the well being of their employees as well as customers
good,I started working there at the age of 16 so this was my first job. I found the work easy and something to pass the day by and get money for doing so. I think that the most enjoyable part of the job was changing sale. I loved doing that because it was different than handling food. The hardest part of the job was not being able to touch the fruit that came through my line. I'm allergic and had to wear gloves all the time.
good,Company is stable and growing. It is evolving and as managers we are changing with it. I enjoy working with customers and providing solutions to their questions as well as working with the store team.
good,Friendly atmosphere. There are both pros and cons to working as a cashier.
good,"Working third shift is great if that's the thing you're into, it was quiet and you barely had customers coming in. You got your work done and you knew what to expect coming into the job, in saying that it's not the most exciting place to work."
good,front end supervisor also did cashier duties and other various duties.
good,"Restock shelves with products."
good,YOUR RUNDOWN!
good,ok place for a high school grad........very friendly i learned out of this whole experience that is you have to argue with the management for more hours...they dont give many hours
good,"I have worked for Weis Markets for over 6 years, it is an ok place to work depending on your job title. I have recently had my second child and require a different schedule, that is the main reason I am looking for a new job.If you have open availability, then its a good place to work."
good,"Pay is pathetic, expect alot for what they are willing to pay. Fairly flexible with family/work schedule. Employees are mostly friendly. Room to move in the company  however pay rates dont move much and expect much for little pay."
good,Easy job for someone in high school or college looking to make quick money. They give yearly raises ($.50) a year. Mid day shifts were usually busy but towards the night it was very slow and boring. Management would be upset that it was slow and harass cashier's to do busy work.
good,"big on customer service and customer experience "
good,"I have nothing good to say about weis ,the management was terrible "
good,Overall working for weis markets was very stressful.  We never knew what to do from day to day.  It would vary with what the managers expected.  It was very frustrating.  Employees were not treated fairly.
good,Some of the people  are are  good  to work with  it is a fast paced  job  a lot of duty to a lot of responsibility but they do not  like to hire full time that is the only  thing that bothers  me the most important  of all about the job
good,its fast paced theres a lot to do getting cashiers change counting cash drawers helping the customers taking payments answering the phone putting stuff away doing refunds etc.
good,"I understand not all Weis stores are the same, but at my store, we're always short handed. This leads to more work being assigned to the associates with little regard to health and welfare. As of November 27th, my store has had at least 5 people call out and 2 walk out every day for the last week. You will be expected to do more than your fair share, depending on department. I have never received a pay raise because Maryland has raised the minimum wage on an annual basis, and Weis calls that our annual raise."
good,"If you are looking to advance into a Management role then this company is a great place to work. However you will work swing shifts, all weekends and every holiday. If you have no plans of spending time with your loved ones then this is the place for you. I did learn a ton of valuable assets at this company. Inventory processes, 5s policies, Budgets, Profits and Loss and many more things including customer service relations. I did like working for this company with two children it seemed difficult to balance my work and home life. Because I was not interested in upper Management I was not compensated well for my duties. I have considered this company an option even today now that my children have grown up more. I am just not ready to relinquish my entire life to them....."
good,"Very Hectic work place,employees do not come to work. Employees always late.Employees always getting smart with customers."
good,Management is really bad. They don't do swap of shifts if you cant work when you are scheduled you get documented for that. Its just unorganized and its very bad.
good,It’s a good first job for a teenager but for an adult it’s not a job you can pay your bills with. You do build a lot of skills for example I’ve become a more reasonable patient person working as a customer assistant  helping people choice what they want .
good,"Some friendly coworkers, not all. Very solitary position, only talking to the customers. Stocking the shelves and coolers. Unloading skids or beer/ wine."
good,"It was alright, but corporate meddling made life as a Weis employee difficult.  I understand corporate is meant to see the ""bigger"" picture, but can't help but think that if they explained how we fit into it, we'd be more understanding of changes."
good,"Yes it was a job, but no matter what I did it was not good enough got no recognition for all the hard work I did day in and day out. Management never gave any kind of thank you to me for everything I have done and gone out of my way to do."
good,Great coworkers but unprofessional management. Expected to do way too much for little pay. There were some people that trained me phenomenally and others that were under qualified to train me properly.
good,"The job itself isn't bad, but sometimes fast-paced and stressful. Most coworkers and management are friendly, helpful, and understanding, but one manager is often rude, temperamental, and verbally abusive. In addition, pay is low and there are little-to-no opportunities for advancement."
good,Most people work here part time so the hours aren't the best and theres little room for advancement. The managers aren't  good because they're really just not that nice of people. Overall this isn't the best place to work at.
good,"Everyday was usually the same work, stock shelves and communicate with customers. The management recently has become a pain to deal with, they have no sense of responsibility or communications unless beneficial to themselves. My co-workers are actually enjoyable to be around and make the job a bit more bearable. My job as a frozen stock clerk isn't terribly difficult just understaffed which results in work build up."
good,"I am just looking for higher pay and more hours.more positive place and enviroment with nice co workers,stuff like that.my current job cuts hours and doesnt train for newer positions."
good,"Working at weis isn't fun like you would think it would be, people were rude and nasty. Employees aren't nice sometimes and there is a lot of favortism throughout the whole store. I felt like I didn't get paid enough for all the work that I was doing and I didn't get treated fairly. It's pretty hard to get fired from there unless you steal which was ridiculous because I saw a boy sell alcohol to a minor and didn't get fired."
good,Enjoy showing management I am a hard working and love to help the customer find items and help them with any needs they might have. I love to be the go to person. Have worked in 3 different departments.
good,The people I worked with were awesome I advanced fast and moved up to assistant manager. I made food slices and prepared all the ingredients for special orders.  We made fresh bread and cakes.
good,"a work week was being on call and being able to come in from 6am-10pm, sometimes working 15 hour days if it was needed, I am grateful for the people who I met and who I worked with, and wish all of them the best of luck."
good,"Stocking Shelves "
good,"I enjoyed working for Weis, however was never given any of the benefits, bonuses, additional training, advancement, or increased wages I was promised. Even a promissory 6-month wage increase given in writing at my initial hiring was ultimately not honored."
good,"I started back in Jan 2015, and can I tell you what a great business that was. But starting in June 2015 it started going down hill."
good,"They talk that they care and try to copy "
good,"A typical day at Weis would be one filled with various types of customers. You'll have someone that's really nice to you, then the next person is rude, disrespectful, and doesn't care. "
good,Some of the positions I held required a lot of responsibilities but they do not pay for them. The pay is horrible for everything that you need to do. I enjoyed meeting new people everyday and I have learned a lot but it was not for me at the time.
good,"I unloaded and separated merchandise according to aisle. Stocked the merchandise, pulled aisle to make look neat, cleaned up at end of night. I didn't learn much of anything it is a thoughtless job. Management didn't seem to be that smart. I loved my co-workers. The pay was miserable for all the BS you have to deal with."
good,"I enjoy my job of management and working in the store. I find it satisfying to merchandise and market the store and see the finished product. I enjoy the active busy part of the industry. But, this store in Gettysburg is old and not in the best location to increase business. I is hard to feel as if I will be able to advance due to the fact the store is out of the way, hard to find, and understaffed."
good,well I punched in and got my drawer counted it and started my day. when we weren't busy I would clean or stock shelves or make sure everything was in its rightful place
good,Good place to get experience and become cross-trained in multiple areas.
good,"Just like any regular job. You learn how to multi-task real quick, and you have to memorize every price in-store. Most enjoyable part is the customers."
good,"A typical day at work was very calm. Got the same customers every week and rarely got very busy, just a few rushes at times. The management was okay due to the fact we switch store and assistant managers over 2-3 times. The co-workers are very interesting people. Most of them elderly such as 50 years of age and up. Only a few young ones. But as far as a job to work and make a few dollars on the side, it is a good job. But career wise it is not a good choice to do. Ive worked there for about 2 1/2 years and they start you off with 7.25 and get a 15 cent raise every (6) months. Im currently 19. Plus you have to really be about your work and not pay the non sense anymind because people talk a lot and its best to keep business and personal friends seperate when on the job. If weis wanted me to work for them again I will but only at a different store. Ive learned a lot of customer service through those couple years and I also got to learn about the post office such as shipping packages and labeling packages. The hardest part about tht job was getting there on time due to it being (4 miles) a 1 hour and 10 min walk from my home. The most enjoyable part of the day was ringing customers out, making them smile, and leaving satisfied."
good,"Not the worst job I had, but certainly could have been a lot better.  Bitter, sour people served as management in the Bakery department, everyone else seemed friendly.  I was promised formal training in the bakery and a raise after 90 days, but they never followed through and kept refusing for no reason.  There are a lot of hours during the busy season in summer, but come September your hours are cut by more than half.  They don't pay well and overall store management (not to be confused with department management) seems nice and understanding, but they often group together like a clique and ignore the rest of the team.  Other employees were friendly at my location, but it always seemed like the lazy people got rewarded and the industrious ones got punished.  Also, workers taking smoke breaks was fine, but non-smoking employees weren't allowed to go for the same quick breaks to get a drink or anything."
good,"I learned a lot for all the managers I work with, but this company is a more learn as you go and there is no real training. I learned a lot about customer service and Weis is all about customer service. They roll out a lot of different programs for customers."
good,"Weis offers plenty of opportunity for advancement the only thing that is wrong is the process for advancement. If you are a college student for something other than business management you can forget about being promoted. I enjoyed most of my co workers they were friendly, outgoing, energetic, hard working, honest, and willing to work.  "
good,"a typical day consist of walking in and finding where you're positioned for the day and preforming your duties. sometimes you may have to put off duties to help another department or pick up the slack for co worker. i have learned to run a register, work as part of a team, how to ""sweep"" or collect money from drawers and put it into the vault for processing, how to stock, how to adjust to stressful situations, and how to keep the morale up with co workers. management has two or three good guys but most of management lacks communication. most of my co workers are friendly and hardworking with the exception of some teenagers and one or two adults who don't pull their weight. the hardest part of my job is finding workers to help when a situation has become extreme and i need extra hands. i enjoy the socialization with customers and employees."
good,"how to work as a team player,learn to bake different kinds of stuff every day, putting all the frozen put away,when my shift is over i can go home and play with my grandson"
good,They train you in any department you apply for and are flexible in hours. There is oppertunity for advancement.
good,"Basic minimum wage job, experience a plus, normal busy food market where you deal with a lot of customers"
good,"Working in deli/food service can be stressful but bearable, if your working with people that you get along with well. The food service side is tough to manage if you’re working by yourself. Hardest part of the job is keeping up with food logs (keeping records of the hot food that was made). The most enjoyable part of the job is getting your paycheck."
good,Working at Weis Markets there is always an opportunity for self growth and improvement. It truly depends on what you want to do and what you are willing to do to get there.
good,"they promised you a lot but didn't seem to come through on a lot of things."
good,Can be taxing.  Definitely repetitive and physically demanding.  Front end manager rarely available to help.  Learn as you go!  Overall it was fine for a part time job.
good,"Most lower management understand what the departments are dealing with. upper management, over the last few years, has started cutting back on their workforce. they can't keep up with hiring, since the benefits don't stack up to other stores."
good,"Very stressful environment. Weis upper management expects perfection constantly. The stores would run alot better if every1 was on the same page. Alot of lazy workers, including managers!"
good,"Working at Weis is not a hard job physically but the mental strain can get to you.  Its nowhere near the worst job but things about it make it hard to stay motivated and enthused. I've learned how to cut, wrap, package meat, etc. The worst part of the job is feeling used, being promised promotions and advancement only to be left disappointed. The best part of the job is the other employees. Of course there are a couple bad ones but for the most part my coworkers are friendly, always laughing together and telling stories just to make the day better and go faster."
good,Would like to see associates compensated with pay increases and more educational opportunities. Shift differential would also be nice to have.More evaluations need to be given in a timely manner. Maybe making the store unionized for equal rights and pay would be considered.
good,Definitely a job and working for weis taught me a lot and gave me a lot of experience but I need to move on and find something better in my life. Weis need to learn to pay more for their employees especially the hard workers
good,Was very stressful. The managers/supervisors were overbearing and wanted tasks done even if I was still working on previous assigned tasks. Besides that it wasn’t too bad
good,"It is not a difficult job, it is mostly just physical labor involving simple tasks. the environment is friendly and understanding of your schedules to a point, they will occasionally call to ask if you can come in on your days off. It is a good job to have while going to school and only working a day or two a week."
good,"Easy truck driving job. Poor dispatchers, they don't communicate, have cocky attitudes. The dispatchers send 2or more drivers for pickups, when there us no Hing to puck up. The company can be more profitable if they would communicate with drivers, communicate with stores to schedule return pickups. Supervisors are good (the ones that actually drive/drove truck)."
good,"I would typically spend approximately 75% of my time behind a register handling customer transactions and answering questions customers may have had, the other 25% of my time was spent either cleaning the front end of the store, or organizing products. As a sales associate I learned how to interact with customers and problem solve. The most difficult days on the job were when the store was completely full of customers, such as before a storm, and we would have to give up breaks in order to keep up with the rush. My favorite part of the job was interacting with customers and other employees on a personal level and getting to know them as individuals."
good,"The amount of inconvenient rules that exist grow instead of decrease, making a straightforward and simple job rather frustrating. If there is an issue with a customer, managers will often disregard the rules to reward complaining customers, thus encouraging their sense of entitlement and nasty attitudes. At my store there was a lot of favoritism and clique activity, and, if you were not in favor, good luck transferring or staying in departments (depending on which you prefer), getting the hours you want, or being rewarded for working hard. Retail workers in general do not get paid well for how much they endure from customers, and while Weis does pay above minimum wage, it still feels like it's not enough. That being said, I worked there from my senior year of high school until the end of my college career, and they do a good job of working with school schedules. It's really not the worst place to work, but each individual store will hold different work environments, and your experience will really depend on the management. Either way, there is limited advancement, pay, and benefits, so while it works as a part-time gig, it's almost impossible to rely on this job alone to live."
good,"The management and other employees were extremely nice and caring. It is more of a relaxed working environment, as long as you can get your work done, the down time is yours to spend how youd like."
good,As far as pay I felt was fair. But with sick pay and health insurance could have used some improvement. Only earned one personal day inv19 years. So if you became sick you lost a lot of time off without pay. But bonus program was very good .
good,"A good first time job to kids just getting out of school, but for the long run I would look for something else. There’s little to no chances of moving up or making more money. I’ve constantly taken other people’s shifts and showed interest in moving up more than once, and nothing has been done about it. I feel greatly under appreciated."
good,"working at weiss was pretty good. most of my coworkers were pleasant to work with. the management was fair. the customers could be a little abrasive, but you get that anywhere"
good,Weis is a nice starter job but I dont think you can really make a living off of Weis unless you advance and become a manager or customer service cashier and that's difficult to do. The fellow workers are nice and the managers were pretty nice. Only downside was all the managers are young and so they dont know too much about running a store and so some workers were confused on how to do things because we were not properly trained.
good,"When I originally interviewed I asked if it's possible to go from part time, to full time and the hiring manager said yes. That was a lie. I saw a lot of my coworkers overlooked for promotions or given promotions but not adequate compensation for said new responsibilities. When I was given other positions in the front end (self scans, online shopping) I was rarely given adequate training and when I unknowingly made a mistake and told my manager such she just said that's how it is and that I was still in trouble. There was a high turnover rate even for managers. I had four different managers four my department in my time there and three different store managers. My coworkers were awesome though and I miss them."
good,"Very busy during the summer and holidays. I am responsible for all ordering of products, meeting with sales reps, stocking shelves and coolers, cashiering, and scheduling staff. There is a lot of lifting required. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the stocking while ringing out customers at the same time. My favorite part of the job is assisting customers with there purchasing and meeting with sales reps. on new products available."
good,"Ive learned a lot while working at Weis, the most enjoyable part of the job was the people i got to meet and talk with, along with the friends I've made while working there, I have nothing really negative to say about working there."
good,Terrible working environment with gross customs. from being forced to pick fresh vegetables out of inches of murky water and putting it out for sale to making workers with contagious diseases work. Salad bar is all expired.
good,"A typical day involves the same tasks. Early in the morning the deli is opened and the pre-sliced meats and cheeses case must be filled, customers should be waited on and sandwiches and salads should be made. The management is pretty fair in terms of when you need time off they are willing to give it to you."
good,"Having to deal with rude customers, not always having management around to help out made it harder. Dealing with attitudes from customers and employers wasn't the best. A lot of ups and downs with this job."
good,"I would work at weis markets again, just not the one i worked at. My boss was a frequent drug user and made work difficult. So i left after i caught him doing drugs at work and he threatened to have me fired if i reported it. Bad experience."
good,"This job is very beneficial for high schoolers or young college students, and younger people seeking a job to just have some money in your pocket. But there is not much room for improvement or progression within the job. Most concepts of the job aren't hard to grasp but be sure to maintain all facets of your job performance."
good,"The company overall could use some improvement when it comes to collaboration and team effort within the management and the departments. The company is growing and shows a lot of potential for future growth in the industry, but in my opinion the employees should be treated better and the hiring should be more picky. The company helped me grow a lot as an workforce individual and I am grateful for the advancement opportunities that was given to me. This job was a great stepping stone while I went to college."
good,"Working at Weis wasn't bad at first, but over time things got worse with it. Mainly management and no pay raises. Plus, the recognition was just not there."
good,"Working at Weis isn't bad by any means, its just boring and I want to look for a new job whenever I'm there. A typical work day for me consists of stocking the shelves, straightening the shelves, unloading trucks of new items, and helping customers find items."
good,"My typical day starts out by helping customers with any questions they have.  I help put tags up. price items, make sure sales are running smoothly, and that customers are satisfied with their experience.  The individuals I work with are very friendly and make the day brighter by being there."
good,My co-workers were rude and full of drama. The managers are also rude and bully their way into the new employers . It's a childish and immature work place. The pay wasn't worth it and the people there were horrible .
good,"My full time years with this company were very disappointing.  Training is poor and hours can be complicated depending on your position.  However, as a part time job, the company is very accommodating with scheduling p/t employees with hours that positively revolve around other jobs or obligations the employee may have."
good,Weis Markets is a typical retail employer. It is a good starter job for students and they will work with your schedule.  There are opportunities for advancement.
good,"First and most importantly, do not take the whole "" we promote from within"" talk seriously with this company.  From personal experience, I can assure you most of that is just sweet-talking to keep you content with thoughts of a better future, while the sad truth is you just can't take anything the higher-ups say at face value here.  I know for a fact I'm not the first one who has quit due to the countless lies and broken promises over the many years of their employment, and I'm sure I won't be the last.  Having said that however, it was not a particularly bad place to work, all things considered.  Coworkers were generally friendly and easy to get along with, daily tasks were relatively simple and self-explanatory for the position, and aside from the occasional grumpy customer, the overall atmosphere of the workplace was fairly pleasant.  And for those reasons I can't say it was a complete waste of over seven years being employed at Weis, despite zero advancement.  For a summer, or otherwise temporary, job, it's as good a place as any."
good,The hardest part about my job is having to be front end monitor during the holidays. It is so busy and usually there aren't enough people scheduled to help out those days.
good,Good place to work if there is enough employees Can be stressfull always production to do The store manager is always helping other dept when needed its not a bad place to work
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is usually my coworkers. I have been in several locations with this company, and the people have always been the bright spot. The job itself is very repetitious, most of the members of management either expect you to be able to do the job of two people, and management will tell you they plan give you something that you want to temporarily motivate you, but when it's time for it to happen you never receive it. Be it a promotion, a transfer or a pay increase, whatever you have been promised they find an excuse to not give it to you and then wonder why your morale is so low. The healthcare provided doesn't pay for anything, either. They want you to work any and every shift available, come in and work extra when others call off, but the department managers won't do what they ask of you. The other frustrating thing that has been occurring recently is that we are being told to lie to the customers and tell them we can get them products and items that they are searching for, even though they are discontinued and no longer available to be ordered."
good,"They're not going to win any contests for imagination or innovation. Stable company, but not the most diverse or inclusive."
good,"This particular facility was as you would expect a minimum waged job to be! Low pay, no benefits, highly stressed employees, no management, etc...."
good,"Worked with and hired alot of great people.  Enjoyed listening to my associates and how to help improve their work environment.  Learned alot of valuable skills.  Sometimes there were unrealistic deadlines and such, but dealt with as best as possible.  Always busy, but they did ask to much of their associates as far as responsibilities."
good,worked as second shift produce associate. Mainly worked alone on a shift or with one other associate. Other associates left shifts rather unorganized.
good,Attend to customers orders. Prepare daily salads. Clean slicers and make sure deli department is clean and tidy.
good,"A typical day of work consists of covering in areas where help is needed. For someone to be successful in this field, they would definitely need to be a team player. There is constant opportunity for learning new things, so having the want to learn and take on new responsibilities is a must. While being employed here, I've learned many different things, this includes: how to run a register, make bill payments, time management, maintaining inventory of supplies, ordering of supplies, bookkeeping, and scheduling. Not only did I gain these skills, but I have also grown as a person. This job comes with a great deal of stress. However, if you are able to deal with stressful situations well, the extremely personable and friendly regular customers make it worth it."
good,"A typical day of work would start with calling the warehouse to find out where you were going and what time you were starting.  Start times for my shift could be as early as 2PM, or as late as 10PM."
good,"Weis Market is a great job it's very friendly, and productive. They have good customer services. What I learned at Weis is how to run the customer services desk and how to keep up with money. The hardest part of my job is making sure that when I close customer services that everything is done and making sure nothing is missing.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers because some of the customers make my day."
good,"Right now i only work one day a week at night. I do the layout for the next morning, clean up the bakery, and help customers. Normally I am alone, on occasion i work with the one cake decorator who is very nice. My current manager is nice and works with us if we want off. The hardest part would be not knowing when I will work till a day or two before the new week and having to call every week to find out when i work. The most enjoyable part would be seeing the customers reaction when the pick up there cakes."
good,"A typical day would be stocking the shelves and making an order. I enjoy working with my co-workers, it makes the day go faster. The hardest part of my job is lifting the heavy boxes. I enjoy facing the products on the shelves, it makes the aisle look cleaner, more appealing."
good,"There wasn't much room to advance, and the management style seemed poor. Too many people got away with things they shouldn't have been doing, and certain things I didn't find to be optimal for guaranteeing customer satisfaction."
good,"The job was fun. I got to meet all kinds of people. I learned to deal with the good and bad people. I enjoyed stocking shelves, knowing how to reorder product."
good,"Very friendly environment and co-workers. I became permanent friends with almost everyone I worked with even after I left. The job itself can be very stressful at times. Certain people chose to be lazy and you have to pick up on their slack. Managers were maybe too nice at times, should be more strict. 10-15 cent raises, if you even get one. It is possible to become a manager, all you have to do is ask, literally...Probably not such a good thing when you have a poor worker training to become a manager. Very fast working environment. Floors greasy. Have to do lots of cleaning. If you are a good worker you will find yourself doing everyone else's job! They will also expect you to do more than other people if you show that you can. The ones who do slack off don't get punished either!"
good,A typical day at work was serving roughly 30-50 customers within a shift. Keeping my area clean and stocked full of merchandise. I learned about different kids of seafood. The management team expected way to much out of their workers. The co-workers were rude and irresponsible. The hardest part of my job was finding where different merchandise was. The most enjoyable part of my job is serving the customers and making sure they get quality.
good,"I run register so I deal with the public all day, which I enjoy. My co-workers are very friendly and we help each other out with whatever needs to be done."
good,"1. Over view of the days progress, explore the work for the active night, close up store and monitor every department while proceeding with operations of a night clerk and store manager."
good,many issues with management worked in many areas and just wanst happy with the place itself
good,"All days very. The store I am at is hard to predict sales and customer volume. We may not have enough cashiers scheduled causing limited time to get audits, sweeps, breaks, lunches and other cash related things accomplished. My co-workers range in age and experience from 16 years old to 83 years old. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the customers and making them happy."
good,Has been a successful company for 100 years and enetering into the philadelphia are market. has been doing a lot of hiring from outside the company which has not been yielding strong results.
good,It is a good company to work for if you are in school. The pay is low though and not enough hours. They have been cutting hours lately and employees have to pick up more responsibilities. Great work life balance though.
good,Management was rude and dominating. Employees were rude to one another as well. Employees are not put first. Not a friendly environment. Not kept well either.
good,"ok place to start your first job "
good,"job was fun on most days depending who you work with "
good,The job is a nice job for someone who has never worked before put the pay isn’t worth all the work I was with the company for two years and only got a 00.25$ raise
good,"Working at Weis Markets was more so about the co-workers and the customers that you meet along the way. As far as progression and working in the store (specifically the store I'm employed at), it's all about dealing with the strain of lack of help and attitudes produced by it from everyone else. Certain management turn a blind eye to important problems that the employees have to deal with and this could be due to the lack of reliable help or because of what the store is willing to spend on employees."
good,Okay to work with they work with your schedule if you need to take off they work with you  as far as management they have changed over time it’s goes up and down sonetimes
good,They highly depend on people that show up all the time but you don’t get treated right. I’m part time and was working almost 40 hours I was getting paid $9 an hour. They except you to do a lot of things that you don’t get paid for. The managers get mad when you call off or request off. It’s okay for a starting off job but I don’t recommend staying there for awhile.
good,"I really liked working at Weis Markets. I was a dairy stocker, and I enjoyed it very much. My basic job tasks were very minimal, but I liked that. I enjoyed having a sense of purpose. I recommend working at Weis to anyone who wants a part-time position, and a flexible schedule that may change from week to week."
good,"poor management, they treated certain others better and just made up rules that were not in the handbook. It was an okay place to work for, but this isn't for everybody. Retail is easy, but be prepared  to be treated like the lowest if you aren't a popular person. You receive great sales prices, which is good because everything in this store is way too overpriced."
good,"The time I spent at weis markets, was a job suited for someone who is looking for a part time job for a resume starter that’s about it when it comes to working at weis."
good,"It was nice to earn a little side money while I was in High school, but simple put I’ve been paying my own bills since I was 18 and this company does not pay enough to support yourself."
good,I didn’t like working there it was to Stressful and the Managers didn’t communicate will at all and some workers didn’t do they job and got away with it.
good,"I love my job and the people I work with! They are always flexible with your schedule and when you give days off request they always give you the day off. However, I was not receiving the hours that I wanted."
good,This job is something for after school or someone on social security as additional spending money.  It should not be the only means of income unless you are a manager.
good,The Management was god awful and it was a revolving door. No manager stays. Your issues go unresolved if you ask & good luck for asking time off. Really cool and calm employees though.
good,"fun decorating cakes and working with the baking staff"
good,"I enjoyed working for weis but management was spotty sometimes. I always enjoyed when I was able to learn new things and advance my skills. It was always a plus when they had ""fun days."""
good,"It has a flexible work scheduled, and understanding of student scheduled. Friendly work environment, but an underline feeling of apathy with work and company."
good,"managing my front end which i love doing"
good,"Wasn’t the worst job in the world, not the best either, though. Sometimes it was very laid back and slow paced, but other times the exact opposite with the day being stressful trying to get everything we need to get done."
good,I've worked at weis for nearly three years. I started as a cashier. Then a few months into working for Weis I transferred to the bakery. Which has had its ups and downs.
good,I've been with Weis my entire retail career and like most places it has its positive and negatives. Weis is a great company with promoting with it.Everyone here is treated like family but there is gossip. (what retail doesn't have that)
good,"You won't know what you are going to be doing next week schedule wise until the day before, so you have no time to prepare and orient yourself. The management is all over the place. Good place to work if you want to be transferred constantly and learn new positions (which can actually be really useful on a resume). Whether or not it's comfortable all just depends on the department. Seafood/Meat can give you some neuroses sometimes but the Frozen Food or Produce department are great. Stay away from Bakery like the plague. Usually you'll just be doing inventory on the floor to start and honestly it's not that bad, especially in comparison to some of the more demanding places. If the place you work at doesn't have annoying managers it's honestly not that bad but it's nothing outstanding."
good,"Have a daughter with epilepsy and management wasn't very  understandable when I had to be late or call off due to her illness."
good,This is a chain so it is hard to say anything concrete about the company. I liked that it was corporate because it means you get more protection from incidents (the company is always afraid of being sued) and you are generally treated better and more professionally.
good,A typical day at Weis is fairly relaxed except between the hours of 3 and 6. The management can be harsh at times but are able to work well most of the time. It's easy to get along with co-workers and can be enjoyable at times.
good,"Each day had the same thing happening over and over again, becoming slow and boring. The amount of work having to be done per shift was not overwhelming. On your feet for the entire shift so not wearing comfortable shoes would be painful after a while. Did not always get off the days requested even though they were requested more than 2 weeks in advance."
good,"Weis is totally behind in their use of technology. Their register systems are difficult to navigate and not user friendly or fast. Weis needs to simplify everything. It’s difficult to find standard practices on their share point intranet. They are very tight with their money "
good,"I worked at weis markets for 3 years giving it my all in the beginning promised a career. As i worked there i eventually became front end supervisor, SHOWING THE STORE AND ASSISTANT STORE MANAGERS HOW TO RUN A REGISTER. It was not all bad 3 positions in three year. The room for growth after being a monitor was very dim.. it was super competitive and opportunities came once a year. You had to be a real but kisser to get anywhere. And if you were over looked then you will remain over looked for the remainder of the time there. The 10% discount is NOT on the entire stores groceries it IS only on weis brand items which is a real bummer. The raises were way few and far inbetween in all my years of working there i got 3 raises and when minimum wage went up my money would be inflated. So if i made 9.50  and minimum was 9.00 and minimum went up 9 70 i was bumped to 10.00 even losing the 20 cents i previously made. They never handed out full time position and overtime is a BIG no no. They use to let employee work to 40 then cut them all back to 35 max so they would not have to give benefits.some times they talked as if you were replaceable when they also are replaceble themselves. The management sets up unrealistic expectations when corporate comes by and just kisses there butt acting fake when they are around, saying hi to you when the never ever do. Overall a good starter job if you want to have a career let them know your goals early."
good,"Typical grocery store job. good people to work with management for the most part is good.I wish i had a better availability to actually advance,but family comes first."
good,"My day starts at 5am. Finish whatever stock wasn't finished the shift before. Make sure store looks ready to serve the public. Work any stock in backroom that might not have went to the shelf from previous deliveries. Unload deliveries on Mon, Wed, and Fri. Customer service. Set the next shift up for success."
good,"I liked the job very much and really loved the employees I worked with. I like being challenged and knowing that I succeeded and delivered what was expected of me, and most times went above and beyond for the co workers and especially the customers. I pride myself of making sure each customer got what they deserved and expected from my department."
good,A typical day would be trying to clean the backroom and stock the shelves there really wasn't much to learn everyday because it was always the same nothing new.  The people I worked with were great made it fun to go to work hardest part of the job would be trying to find items the most enjoyable was that certain bosses made work fun
good,"shortly after starting @one store, I went to another doing many tasks in the grocery department.  I was training for night manager, when they did away completely with the position.  I applied to be a manager trainee but was over looked because there were many younger applicants.  I built displays, organized the back room, filled & rotated shelves, ordered, broke down pallets, & more."
good,"Typlically a day at work is a good one. I worked in the store so it was the normal day to day routine of helping customers and getting shelves stocked. In the 18+ years that I worked there I learned a ton, book keeping, payroll, managing skills, customer service and employee relations. Management at store level is good, but under a lot of pressure. The most enjoyable part of the job was the associates I worked with on a daily basis and our regular customers that we dealt with. All became family."
good,This job is good for those that have little to no financial responsibility. Hours are not guaranteed as they are competing with other supermarkets. It is a clean and fun work environment.
good,"It's a very nice company to work for , very organized , very into customer service . Management is very nice and outgoing . That is were I learned a lot of my customer service from"
good,Starting at $9 an hour is a bit higher than minimum wage but sometimes there are problems with scheduling and the cutting of hours gets out of hand sometimes.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my customers and making sure their needs are met. A typical day is clocking in, going to my register, and ringing out the customers items. I learned how to ask the customers the right questions to meet their needs and help the company to be more profitable. Most of the managers were very good to work for. The hardest part of the job is when the computer systems did not work well."
good,They treat their employees good . Nice place to start employment. Need to update in some areas on how they operate. Customers dont like their prices but they are improving.
good,Its a grocery job. Not much else to say. Stock shelves and help customers. Management can be lacking. They want alot for no compensation.
good,"I am currently seeking a career, not just a job.  I feel there are not a lot of growth opportunities currently compared to previous employers."
good,"A typical workday is to ring out customers and help any with questions or when help is needed. I learned that most people that come into the store are very friendly and enjoy talking. Management was very poor. The wrong people were fired for stealing, they did not stick to the schedule associates had agreed to, employees were not paid on time, and minors were overworked. My co-workers were either slacking, leaving the store without letting anyone know, or were very sad and unwelcoming. The hardest part of my job was having to deal with the managers who had no idea what they were doing. The most enjoyable part was talking to all of the nice customer."
good,"Weis is a good place to work overall. You can move around to different departments and give them all a try. The working environment there is verry friendly, everyone gets along. The hardest part of the job I would say is working crazy never the same hours."
good,"I worked at the distribution center roughly 4-8 days a month while I am at school.  Most days I would a full shift of eight hours.  It is very physical job and requires a fair amount of strength and endurance to complete the day, while still making performance rate."
good,I love my job working in the Pharmacy! The Pharmacists are wonderful to work for! We are a really busy pharmacy so you always have something to do and work on. The work day can go pretty quickly! Sometimes we feel short handed when we are super busy and it can get overwhelming with people yelling at you to hurry up and complaining about what seems like everything. I wish we would get paid more for the information we have to know and the work we do. That is probably my biggest complaint.
good,"no advancement really"
good,"I worked for Weis Markets from 2009-late 2010. "
good,good hours. very fun place. and easy work. decent pay and great coworkers.
good,It was an alright place to work while still in highschool and flexible with hours.
good,A typical day of work was to come in stand on your feet all day and check out customers. I learned and extreme amount of patience with this job because the customers would take it out on you. The management was really nice as well as most of the coworkers. The hardest part was dealing with the customers when they were unhappy.
good,"its a was ok...there were no late hours...that was a plus"
good,"Atypical working for Weis was that you started your day very early and your left early when you got all of your work completed, not you would be allowed overtime to finish your tasks."
good,The company is alright to work for.  I don't think they fully understand the pricing of merchandise in virginia versus Pennsylvania. The people you work with are great.  It feels like a family.
good,"Not my best experience  "
good,Very fast paced dealing with a lot of people on the job most are friendly you're always interacting with someone so it never gets boring. Overall good place to work.
good,Typical day select orders load trailers everything is on a timed system weather your loading trailers or selecting orders helped out co workers when finished plenty of work to do in a distribution center
good,Make sure you have a specific location. They tend to move you around very often. I worked there for only a year because I was moved to 5 different locations.
good,Good job for high school years but not really one I feel you can run your life with. Hard to move up to full time and does not really pay best with no insurance at part time.
good,Ehh it was fine but dom of the managers there were just mean to certain people for no reason and I didnt really like that. But the work was easy and fun so I had no problem working there really.
good,Was one of my first jobs throughout a lot of high school. I received enough hours to supplement my small expenses. Management was always kind and easy to work with.
good,Learned how to run their systems more proficiently.  It has a great work environment and nice supervisors. Answering a lot of phone calls and multitasking
good,I worked here while i was in highschool worked well with my schedule and I most great friends. I don’t if the same women is there but I worked in the deli and she was a great boss
good,"At the time I was working new management had taken place and I was pregnant at the time, I had a drs note to give to my work and it was disregarded and i was yelled at for heading my dr note and not listening to my new manager"
good,"It is a good team to work for and you are able to learn; to go up the ladder with the company."
good,High turn over rate and short staffing make department managers jobs extra stressful. Long days and no support. Only allowed 40 hours a week no Over time aloud
good,"they want you to learn everything in the store"
good,"I was told that I would have a lot of hours to work and I did not receive that."
good,"It was a pleasure working for Weis Markets. A small company but a good one. I heard stories of older pharmacists getting fired for little or no reason and also stories where an unhealthy pharmacist was supported to keep his position. I cannot corroborate either story so it is a ""wash"" as stories go. From my experience, I would work for Weis again in a minute. Compared to the heartless oppressive CVS experience, Weis was a pleasure!"
good,"I enjoyed working at weis, outside of the store manger. She was rude and very well didn't have the knowledge to be manger.Always making coments about putting work before my child."
good,"Working at Weis was good for a temporary job until I got to college. The work as a cashier was easy to pick up and manage on my own. For the most part, I didn't have too many challenging things with customers to deal with as it was usually the same issues or complaints I would hear about when sales end or that someone couldn't find something, so I learned quickly how to answer these questions."
good,People are nice and understanding helpful when you need a hand and the manager is flexible with hours. Everyone is pretty easy to get along with and the pay is great
good,"There is no paid vacation time for part time employees, only for managers and department managers. You hardly get any days off for work they always ask you to come in on your off days if no one shows up to work. The pay rate is really low."
good,"Weis is a good company for entry level employees, and those the few that want to make a career in management. However I would not make a career in the support roles Weis has to offer."
good,I learned a lot there is not fast paced . I usually worked 40 hrs a week but was sent home early if we got all the work done . Then I was moved to fruits and preparing fruit trays.
good,"Weis are like most supermarkets. They reward customers for their bad behaviour, they don't pay enough, they have the same 100 songs playing every single day, oh and did I mention that the store manager will cut the cashiers hours at the start of the year so he can get his big fat bonus. Also, I tried to get to work in another department but was not given the chance. They won store of the year but they don't deserve it. Also, half of their food is past its sell by date. Would not recommend."
good,"Same you can expect from every cashier/cart pusher job. Bad pay. If You want a part time job at a place where they do the bare minimum, this is the one for you."
good,"Typical busy, depending on the day and time of day"
good,"I haven't worked there in 15 years and I can't really give a accurate assessment.  When I was there,  wages were low - no reliable personnel- management was friendly and very flexible with my needs as a mom"
good,"I did like being a deli associate at first.  It is very fast pace and I was constantly moving around which is nice.  I liked my co workers too and even got to train some associates.  However, the deli was extremely short staff and therefore most of the responsibility of running the deli was shared by two or three people so we were not able to get a lot done which was frustrating."
good,Good starter job.  Easy.  Worked in stock department.  Family owned so management and advancements never quite seem fair but it was just a temporary thing for me.
good,"As a night shift worker at Weis, it can be relaxed, but at the same time, you have to be quick (atleast where I'm located.) As a worker that's been there for 4 years (almost 5,) and that I get paid now 15 cents more than a starting cashier is ridiculous. Don't expect to get paid much unless you have a lead or management position. But not a bad job for someone who's looking for their first job or temporary work."
good,"I enjoyed qorking at Weis Markets, but the pay and the hours were not enough. Only worked up to 30 hours per week and pay was not enough. The employees were very nice."
good,when I worked at weis it was very difficult to advance. they put you in a box and trying to climb and go higher in the company was almost impossible. thank you
good,"Oversee weekly price changes and pricing policy throughout the  "
good,"Lots of logs to fill out throughout the day including, especially temp. of foods, freezer walk-in coolers, The day goes by pretty fast, there is always something to do. Customer interaction, on a professional level. Lots of smiles and may I help yous, customer satisfication a must. If it wasn't for the customers you wouldn't have your job"
good,Everyone was nice and the work was not hard unless it was a busy hour or a holiday was approaching. I had an easy time getting into the grove of things.
good,"I worked for Weis Markets for 9 years after my old company was bought out.  It has been a rollercoaster of emotions ever since.  There is a cutthroat culture within the company.  There is little job security and high turnover.  They act like they value the employees, but they are always looking for ways to get more work from less employees.  It has turned a once enjoyable career, into a stressful job that I am looking forward to leaving."
good,I like the fact that I work 10 minutes from home.  Overall I enjoy the people that I work with daily.  I have learned alot about the grocery business but I still have alot to learn.
good,"If your a workaholic like me then this job is made for you ! Working your butt off, coming in on your day off ,staying over working a longer than your normal shift  and no overtime meaning no appreciation from the managers or the higher up  clientele. Management will cut your hours the rest of the week so you dare don't go over 40 hours ... overtime is a NoNo!!!! So helping out the company doesn't  make your paycheck any different and of course your  not appreciated for all the hard work that you do"
good,"It was good learning all the steps in meat cutting,how to cteate appealing cits of meat to make the roasts and steaks sell quiker.I also learned how to make pork,chicken,and turkeys a good buy for the public"
good,"Enjoyed working at Weis market, learned a lot of skills and enjoyed meeting new people and regular customers.  Family atmosphere and employee friendly experiences."
good,Its not a bad first job. They don't pay more then your average pay. Its not hard. Can be fast pace and days very slow.management is always switching usally every 2 years. So each new manager comes in to change everything right away. Must transaction easily.
good,"Worked on stocking shelves, ordering product and organizing left over product to put out later. I also was a cashier. When management comes in you have to make yourself scarce and are not aloud to ask questions."
good,it was a basic job in a basic supermarket it wasn't bad the managers were nice and reasonable the only con was the location it was in a bad part of town so we dealt with a lot of theft loud rude and undesierable customers but overall the job wasn't bad just the store I was in
good,The job was long and tiring an barely finished my tasks on time. The pay was kinda low for what we did. The benefits are not the greatest. I really enjoyed the customers though.
good,I cut meat pack out meat wrap meat I cut and set up the meat  Service case  do inventory  the people I work with are great the  Company is nice but the pay is not enough
good,"Great place to work, management treated us like we were a part of the team, weekly training sessions which encouraged feedback on how to improve customer service and product."
good,"I worked in the deli, waited on customers and handled customer complaints on a daily bases. I had received one raise that took me 6 months and filing a complaint with corporate to get and it was not made retro active."
good,Depending on who came in to check out the store or the holiday those were the stressful days any other day it was a easy decent job. I was crossed trained through the entire store. The hardest part of the job is hitting the number they expect.
good,"Good atmosphere, a lot of opportunity to grow, good people, will teach you job responsibilities, Management program will help you reach your goals if interested in management position."
good,"My Position at Weis Supermarkets is a fast paced, Competitive environment. The Management is decent toward it's employees. The only issue is balancing a work life and personal with scattered scheduling."
good,"Didn't receive much training, neither was i given the opportunity to advance in my work or performances. I felt as though my work effort was not as productive and fulfilling as i would like. There was always a lack of knowledge in the department due to the fact that information circulated only among certain workers.  lost of interest in the job because i no longer felt motivated and enthused to go to  work. There was very poor communication among employees as well as employers to employees and a lack of trust among staff."
good,The work was tedious but it made the day pass quite quickly. The only thing that made me leave was the amount of work required of one person. The management was lax on the day shift employees while it was left to me the bulk of the work.
good,pay is horrible for what they expect and some of management should not be in retail at all but others are awesome.the company cut hrs and expects way to much from people for very little pay
good,Good first job that builds a solid work ethic.Moved from being a cashier to being in the pharmacy which taught me a lot about efficient processing and attention to detail.
good,"A normal day at work started off very quickly. I would punch in and immediatley be directed to my assigned register. I would then start checking customers out. For part time depending on the hours of my shift, would be one to two fifteen minute breaks.If things started slowing down, sometimes my manager would have me do returns or some light cleaning. Management was not entirely consistent and was somewhat scattered when it came to scheduling and posting important news. That was a big inconvenience. I enjoyed the cusomers mostly. I got to interact a lot with them."
good,"There is not a lot to say about Weis. All grocery store chains are about the same. Low pay, hard work and no room for advancement. Its a nice part time job for teens."
good,While working at Weis Markets I was training to manage Salad Bar in the Produce department. Management in produce left a bit to be desired with poor soft skills and questionable quality control.
good,"Ok place to work."
good,A typical day for me as a Deli Manager is getting the reports for the day.  Filling the shelves and taking inventory of products I need to order to come in.  Waiting on customers for their items they want from the deli sliced for them.  Trying to keep up with our presliced section and keeping the cheese wall full and wait on customers when short staffed.  I love dealing with the customers.  Hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the paper work that needs to be done.
good,"take orders from customers who wanted deli meats"
good,"Overall a well rounded company to work for, having flexible hours and a weekly pay schedule is helpful. Working as a sales associate is good for anyone balancing school as well."
good,"Typical grocery store working environment.  Managers were competent.  Other employees were friendly.  Many employees were temporary, either working a summer job or to help pay for school."
good,"Okay place to work, just not as a career.  Management was fair, but sometimes direction was uncertain.  I enjoyed my time at Wise for the most part, but want to develop in another area of business."
good,Very good for your first job. Works well with your schedule and giving you the time off that you need. Customer are very nice with little to no questions
good,"The coworkers are great, the job is fairly easy. Some customers can be nasty but you learn to deal with it. Customer service is key and always be friendly."
good,my experience at weis is very typical. i completed the same tasks every night. the employees are very relaxed there. nothing about my job is difficult.
good,It depends if you busy or not. Can be very boring. But you can advance to stocking or office. Training. Costumers are always right that can be a very hard part to working with public.
good,Weis has also provided me with a steady job and has given many many opportunities for advancement. The pay is not the greatest but the benefits are good. Can be a really nice place to work  if you have  the right store manager who is willing to work towards your same goals.
good,"Was a relatively good job, strange hours, better fit for someone still in school, relatively good pay rate , not somewhere a person should work as career choice."
good,"the work was not dificult however working behind the deli counter everyone would always gossip about whoever was not there that day, i hated it. the manger was a real pain as well and never had you stand around, even if all the work was done she was never satisfied. most dificult part was keeping up with the demand that our manager had and also the customers. best aprt of the job was closing up and going home."
good,could have some good days but then have some bad ones as well but the people there are very out going and open to new associates. plenty of opportunity to get promotions or switch departments.
good,Customer friendly. Focuses mainly on that than the happiness of their workers. You get good hours if they like you. They usually dont care if you put for time off they might still schedule you.
good,It wasn't a difficult job but managers and front end monitors did some of the front end people made the job feel not so friendly at times but in most cases it was a decent job just management wasn't the best.
good,"Fun co workers but management has a lack of communication.  The hardest part of the job is working overnight, I would like to advance up and go back to working days."
good,"I enjoyed some aspects of the job, some of the management staff was less desirable. I did enjoy the thrill of selling in the sales competitions. Some locations were less desirable than others."
good,A lot of hours expected to be worked. Very busy and constantly on your feet. This was a good first job to have in high school to get comfortable in a work environment.
good,Type day is getting things ready to start shift and starting work by walking back and forth all day long stocking items in shelfs.Have learned alot about hard work and helping customers. The culture is good of good people and to work there. The hardest part is dealing with cold and going back and forth with more stuff to work as well as pushing the unboat of the stuff. Enjoy stocking and making sure it's well kept on shelfs.
good,"No good benefits, terrible vacation plan. Great job for high schoolers and college students. Very hard to get raises and move through the company....."
good,"Weis is a temporary part-time job for me until I am able to pursue a full time, career job."
good,The day seem to take forever cause of the slow pace off work. They are very short staffed. management is okay. hard to stay focused cause of the slow pace
good,"I thought Weis was a good job, but it's not something I enjoy doing.  I like to be constantly busy and hands on. At times the job was boring due to a lack of customers. Beyond holiday season I was given too few hours."
good,"Our store originally was Food Lion got bought by Weis Markets. While Weis does offer some nice benefits that Food Lion does not, corporate is unfair to their new stores in VA compared to their other ones, they treat these stores and associates as a number."
good,I enjoyed my job with weis market my boss said I was one of the best employees he had working in the deli I cooked hot food and slice meet
good,the guys were fun to work with and easy to get along with.  there was a lot of repetition in drawings at that time and we were starting to learn how to draw on the computer with AutoCAD.
good,The managers that were there when i was working were very poor and just could not get it together. No one seemed to care about their job and it showed in how they worked and how they took care of the store.
good,Enjoyed working with the public I loved the daily challenge and had a great team . learned a lot of good working skills and feed back but the turn over with store manager made it very hard.
good,It is a great place to work especially once management got changed over. You will always stay busy doing something. All of the coworkers were respectable and nice. Everyone was willing to help the next person whether it was a customer or a coworker.
good,"I have always enjoyed working my job at Weis"
good,Its everything you can except in a grocery store.  I meet a lot of nice people there. Meeting new customers was the best part of the job.
good,"A typical work day is making sure paper work is complete and taking care of customers are having the best experience possible. "
good,"My job is good for a part-time job. Weis is very stingy with hours, therefore I only get about 25 hours a week. The coworkers and management are pretty great for the most part. Weis isn't the greatest place to try to move up in, so what you're hired for is basically what you do for as long as you want to work there."
good,"I have worked here for over a year, but I feel that they do not care about their employees enough. meaning the pay, benefits ect. working in the deli I should be paid more than cashiers I am not, I did not receive my yearly raise I was promised. and also was given a weeks vacation that I was told was going to be paid and it was not."
good,"Start at field trailer. Look at construction plans concerning work scheduled for day. Travel to work site to inspect and measure quantities of work in progress for the day. Return to field trailer to write reports,  and update amount of work completed to date and paid for, and to also schedule next day work. Review plans to determine any extra work that is due in order to complete various tasks, and then proceed to process change order claims when this work is completed by contractors. Sometimes supervise trainees (1 engineer trainee, and 2 trade technician trainees) during construction activities (e,g roadway and bridge paving, sign structure installation, soil excavation etc.) On some days sit in construction meeting with municipal and other governmental agencies, and utility companies to give and obtain briefing on right of way, temporary  scheduled power, water, and sewage cutoff, traffic detour, and other situations that affect project progress."
good,Working for Weis Markets has been an enjoyable experience. My direct team had great chemistry and understood how to accomplish goals and work together
good,good i liked it very nice people. everyone is great. i like to eat food so its a good place to be. very nice customers. good. god. good. good. good. good. god. good. good. good. good. good.
good,this job was pretty decent. i got to learn the inner workings of a grocery store overnight. the hardest part of this job was the heavy lifting but i just thought of it as a workout.
good,"Considering this was my first job, it was a great start. However, the work environment was not so great. The hardest part of this job was dealing with unhappy coworkers nearly every shift. The advancement opportunity was awesome, being that I worked here for under 3 years and I was offered multiple higher positions. The most enjoyable part of this job was that I was able to learn so much from it."
good,It started out as a nice place to work as a cashier. Then there was a problem starting with the register. So I was moved to the Produce dept. for awhile and then back and forth from produce and bakery. Then the medical leave happened and I came back and they let me go.
good,"i learned a lot about customer service"
good,"A typical day at work is a very busy day, there is always something that needs to be done. I have learned a lot of patience with working with the people, how to use a cash register, and how to run a department. The management is good, they are always will to help when needed. My co-workers are very friendly and willing to help. The hardest part of the job is lifting heavy items over the bag racks. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my coworkers."
good,It is a good job but they are not very organized and give very little hours. Im a minor so I understand the restrictions but it is ridiculous that i am only getting around 10-13 hours per week. Incredibly frustrating and doesn't change even when I have talked to them multiple times.
good,"A decent starter job, but lacks the complete compensation package to make this a career.  Recently they have improved their overall compensation package, but it is still lagging behind the rest of the industry."
good,I loved the customers that come into Weis. They're so loving and caring. Some of the people I work with are awesome and some of the managers are very helpful.
good,"Started this job when I was still in high school and stayed there throughout the remainder of my high school career. Great job, even though under labor laws you couldn't work more then 20 hours a week during the school year so you only earned a meager $120 a week. I was surrounded by good hard working people who made this place enjoyable to come to everyday. I liked stocking the freezer, mainly because I was by myself, and even pushing the carts for exercise purposes."
good,Weis Markets is a good company to work for if properly managed. The previous management at the company made the place very hard to work for.
good,"Good employment for students and elderly. Sometimes fast paced, usually steady working environment. Would recommend working a few different departments to find your best fit."
good,"Best part of my job is my regular customers, My department was easy and I learned a lot. Store needs to work on some of the management and then it will be a better store."
good,"A good, happy environment. Loved my coworkers and the easy going flow of the store. Was a great first job. great work place"
good,Its very fast paced and are willing to train. They have places to improve on but over all the atmosphere is a chill place and very fun people.
good,"I would work here again if given the chance. Everyone has drama in their life, but the butt-kissing is a real downer. I am not a butt kisser, and I found this to be a definite 'downer' on my job outlook. I am a major people person, so this was not a good mix."
good,"Nice job for a high school teenager or college student. Flexible hours and okay pay. Manager's were nice, but since a corporation things needed to be a very specific way. Very structured, but no free thinking allowed."
good,you drive around jacks and pick items off of skids and place them on your pallets. the work is hard but the pay is good. you have to work your way up through the system
good,"Busy retail supermarket, but not a lot of loyalty to employees.  Not a lot of room for advancement, or promotion.  Pay is not all that great."
good,"It was a simple cashier job, got along fine with management, coworkers and customers. Was never to stressed, people were there to always help."
good,"I enjoyed the friends I made while working there, they're like a family to me! The only downside was my manager belittled her employees and made them feel bad. She got so many people to want to quit, and enjoy their jobs less. I loved the customer bonds I made and learning about them the more they came in. From this job, I learned how to become a more sociable person, and how to take responsibility."
good,"A typical day at work is unloading my truck and putting product away. There isn't enough help in the store, so I have to work my department myself. Management wants sales but they don't seem to care that you have to do it by yourself and give you no backup when you are not there."
good,I started off in deli and after three months was on register in another store. A month later I was running customer service and would fill in on register or deli if needed. I processed all customer returns and exchanges. Pulled tills and safe counts. I also set up schedules for the front end for breaks .
good,"was on the meat slicers "
good,"When I started, was family orientated, they cared about their employees. When I left the company didn't care about its employees. Forcing dedicated, reliable, loyal long time employees out of the company is their motto now, in my personal opinion."
good,"Very nice place to work, nice coworkers,  could have used more hours."
good,"Work well with community, work very well in fast past days. I was commended on several occasions from management for doing well and received small rewards. "
good,"Work was fine, yet the gas station was lonely. Hours were good if you were in a position that didn't have many individuals trained in it."
good,I enjoyed working there as one of my earlier jobs. Regular cashier kind of job.
good,horrible people and expectations are ridiculous. most enjoyable part was quitting
good,you will work but do not expect a career. Management is more concerned about golf and each other than the work at hand
good,"I would usually go to work at be at the store before the store opened every day. I would check in all the vendors who delivered their products to the store and do inventory on those products. On my down time when I didn't have any vendors I would clean and organize the back room and scan and send out all of our damage products to our warehouse. I learned various new things in this position like how to do inventory and transfer items to different stores and different locations. Management was okay for the most part. They would check up on me during the day to see how things were going and made sure I was keeping up on all the daily tasks and keeping the warehouse clean. I enjoyed my co-workers very much. There was a small group of co-workers that I became very close too and we all became good friends. The hardest part of the job was time management--being able to keep up with deliveries and organizing and cleaning the warehouse. It was stressful at times because before I left work every day I made sure the warehouse was clean, but when I came in the next day I would always have to clean it up again because of other employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with the vendors every day. I got along great with them and they got along great with me too."
good,"Come in at 4 am turn everything on and start proofing donuts."
good,You work fast paced trying to make your department look presentable and accessible for customers
good,"Nice place to work."
good,I enjoyed working at this store.  It was a good way for me to earn extra money.
good,Working at Weis was a job that I enjoyed. The people I worked with were great people and very helpful.
good,"the typical day at work is overly exhausting. We're on our feet for the entire eight hours or more depending on the time your scheduled. I've learned that working for the Weis Market isn't something I'm interested in. From what I've seen, the co-workers aren't that bad, they are funny and friendly but they work when they have to. The hardest part about the job is everything..the most enjoyable? when its time to clock out and go the heck home!"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers. My basic job functions was to ring customers out and stock groceries.
good,"While working for Weis, I acquired a lot of new skills. I learned how to do everything involving Human Resources along with payroll. I learned accounting skills as I have also been doing store bookwork for them. I have also filled in in the pharmacy so I know how to do all the duties of a pharmacy tech as well."
good,"A typical day at Weis involved me restocking and relocating items throughout the store. I would stock the freezers and dairy items most often but was able to restock throughout the store. When Weis was short staff, management would have me cashier or work in other departments such as the deli. I learned how to use a register for the times that I was asked to cashier and I also learned how to complete various other jobs in a grocery store. The main thing I learned while working at Weis was how to ask for help when necessary and how to work with my co-workers in order to complete tasks on time. The hardest part of my job was understanding the management. They were unorganized and often changed my schedule without me knowing. I would show up at work in the morning only to realize they changed my hours to night shift without notifying me. I also went on a vacation, in which they knew about, and when I arrived back home, I called to check my hours. They told me that I would be on the next schedule and they would call me when it's posted. I called numerous times, only to get the same answer. This went on for about a month until I realized I probably wasn't going to be put back on the schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that it got me out of the house and doing something. I really enjoyed my co-workers, they were always there to help. I also enjoyed the sense of freedom. I went in and would stock things all day and complete all the tasks that management had given me."
good,"There was never a ""typical"" day at Weis Markets. Everyday was different from the day before which makes work entertaining. I am cross-trained in numerous departments, so I would work in different areas daily. I have worked in the produce and health/beauty care department, cashiering, customer service, auditing drawers, dealing with Western Union, and checking emails. We have a corporate office and the store would get random visits from them making sure everything was running smoothly, leaving a list of new rules and policies. I've learned that customer service is a huge part of life and always treat people the way you would want to be treated. It really is a good way to think. In the 7 years that I have worked for Weis, I have worked under 10 or 15 new managers, each one with their own work ethic. I am a social person so I try my hardest to befriend everyone and get to know them. The hardest part of my job would have to be working with people that don't take pride in their work. When a person doesn't care about the job they do, its not only noticeable to coworkers, but to the customers. I am never satisfied with a job unless I finish it completely. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people. I love working with my co-workers and the customers. When a customer has a problem, to be able to make that problem disappear solely by relating and do all I can to fix it, it makes my day and the customers day better."
good,"As a lead stock clerk, I assign appropriate tasks to other when required. I do whatever is required in the grocery department from helping customers, the most enjoyable part, the working bays, the hardest part of the job. I am friends with all of my co-workers in the grocery department, and I believe productivity is increased when we all work together."
good,i stock shelves and work the front end helping customers and doing paper work.
good,it was just a ok place to work. some people was nice.nothing much to say about management
good,Descent place to work liked employees but money was bad would work there again
good,Weis markets is a decent place to work for a kid in school or for someone out of college trying to build a career.
good,Good Environment with trustworthy people. Treat their employee's very well.
good,Typical day would be type up briefs on commercial properties to present to the Board of Review to reduce property taxes. Apply payments to payment from clients and various duties that where required to be done during the day.
good,this is a good job for kids in school due to the flexible schedule.
good,"A typical day at work was the everyday thing, ring up the customer's groceries properly by the customer's demands. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customer's, they can tell when you feel down a little and love small talk."
good,I enjoy working as a gas clerk The best part of the job was helping customers and to see a smile on their face. The hardest part of the job was being able to not figure out why their gas points werent on their weis cards I had no excess to that information. I had great co-workers who alway help me out when i needed help. The managers were on top of everything doin their best to make their customers happy as well as their employees
good,overall it was a good job but did not pay enough. there were alot of nice people that worked there.
good,I  would it like it a lot more if I got more hours. Other than that I like working here. Everyone I work with is very nice and we have fun working together. There are a few nice managers too.
good,"A typical day at work included preparation, a constant period of non-stop work during peak hours, and sanitation at the end.  Management was poor as they did not care too much about the workers.  I learned how to greatly deal with people and gained interpersonal skills on a daily basis.  The culture was stale, as many just wanted to keep to themselves and not assist others.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers and finding a way to solve the situation while keeping the company seem professional in its processes. The most enjoyable part of the job was communicating and helping employees and customers when management was busy."
good,"In my interview, I was told that i could work what was best for me & when i started working it was nothing like said by the hiring manager. Not the best experience."
good,Working for weis is ok it's a job. I'm not as stressed like I was at my other job. It's a paycheck but not what I should be getting paid when I have experience and manager experience
good,"I left after a few years there. They were asking me to put out bad quality product, to save time. I had put up with the dept manager doing that for years, but I wouldn't stoop to that level myself. I tried a million times, with probably 5 different general managers (2 different store managers), to get things to change and it never happened. I had tons of evidence that product was being reused, or kept for longer than it should've been. I also trained in four different departments and only got 0.75 raise over the three years, when they had just started advertising to give new hires 0.30 raises after 30 days. Regular workers are only allowed 2 10 min breaks, and your lunch, but ones who smoke can sneak out for as many as they want. "
good,i was always stuck on register while everyone else was basically able to do what they want to do. I would often ask to move but never was allowed to because they would allow someone else to do it
good,Weis was very stressful due to all of the workplace drama. It's a job specifically made for teenagers who are just starting out and this specific location is very catty and there's lots of workplace drama.
good,Fast- paced atmosphere. Workers are helpful and nice. Cashiers try and move to the best of their ability with customers and also helping others. Can be a bit stressful if you are new
good,"There is no standardizations for pay. Promotions will earn you a 5% increase at the most if anything at all no matter what the new role is. But then you will receive a much lower yearly increase or none at all the following year to even things out. It doesn't matter that your pay is tens of thousands of dollars below national average. Because of which, employees have been punished for discussing salaries. They understand that there isn't a lot of competition in the area in regards to employment, so they take advantage of it. No different from how they set up prices within their stores. If there is no competition in the surrounding area, they will happily hike up prices putting the surrounding community at a disadvantage."
good,"This is a decent retail environment to work in.  It is a growing company, but their technology often is a few steps behind.  They like to promote from withing for lower level full time positions."
good,"Best part interacting with associates and customers. Stressful work culture for managers.  The manager can have a fun work place culture in his own store as long as he / she does not have any conflicts with upper management.Hardest part of the job is trying to please everybody, H/R and Asset protection think they run the operation. You report to a District manager but when there is an issue, H/R thinks they are in charge of the manager who runs the store."
good,"It's a great place to work, mainly geared towards high school students as you won't make bills at the pay rate. I enjoyed it for the most part, I worked consistent hours and people are usually willing to trade hours if something comes up that you can't work your shift or day."
good,"My time here was good, downside some coworkers constantly called off good managers get replaced with terrible managers. The pay is weekly & it was good"
good,Weis is a positive atmosphere and I learned to be more interactive there and my management is good to me and have been a great help. The job is easy and what I love about the job the most is getting to know my customers.
good,If you work at weir chances are theres little to nothing left available to you. Typical retail work includes talking to guests and helping them quickly and efficiently. The weir I worked at looked down on calling out sick even if you worked near the deli and other fresh food services. The management was very tight. The co-workers are however one of the best parts. If you can get a full part time shift (34 hours/week) then you make just enough to get by and will still have to probably pick up another job
good,"The job was done 3rd shift where nearly the whole shift you spend lifting  quickly and frequently. Most packages are light (5-20 lbs) but you will be feeling worn in your back in addition to growing a second pair of knees from frequent kneeling on the concrete floors. Moving the freight, stocking, and making everything presentable needed to be completed fast. The crew I work with really don't like their job and well it's not a good one. Work is tough most of the time due to poor management and communication between depts, not to say the managers were bad too; they were great. There are hardly any benefits offered pay is a hair above the minimum since it's at night, Sunday and holiday rate was barely higher than the going rate, they did not want to have to pay overtime, (even though we were normally overworked and shorthanded). As PT I went from 3 to 4 days per week and was asked to come in for and additional half day 3/4 day (so I wouldn't get to FT)."
good,A typical day is fast paced and very different each day. I have learned that when things are changing to get out and lead the parade.As a manager people dont't care what you know until they know how much you care Our culture is one of immediate action and measured results. The harest part of the job is when a customer or associate is disappointed.The most enjoyable part of the job is when you make someone's day.
good,"Job is a fast paced environment, has many opportunities within store and within district/other stores. Some of the management is ok,some aren't. Company sees employees as dispensable, like most retail jobs. Hours are ok."
good,"Weis is constantly cutting hours, but always hiring. Management refuses to fire people, even with customer complaints or the employee not doing/doing terribly at their job."
good,"Stressful job"
good,"This was a relaxed place to work while still in school. The stress level  is low, and the job doesn't require much thought. The pay is poor, but the management is easy to please."
good,Great for young adults who are simply looking forward to making a couple dollars after school. People are willing to work with your schedule. Only downfall is they want your life to be Weis because their's is.
good,"This job would be a great first job. When I started they hired at 7.65 / hr and they paided weekly , Usually you received 24 hours a week but could pick up more by doing other positions. This job  is great for anyone looking to start at the bottom and work your way up to the top."
good,"I do not feel the want or need to give a review on this job establishment, but the job has a decent pace during the day & easy to learn how to do new things."
good,"A nice little place to work for anyone who wants a job. Treats their employees relatively fair, must be able to work during stressful situations delay. All and all, not too bad of a place to work."
good,"Ability to move up quickly, but they will cut you off at a certain point. Even if you ask to advance higher. They don't work with college schedules well, and if they do, don't make plans for a weekend ever again. Perfect job for teens."
good,"As the Price Accuracy Coordinator my work day starts off by doing a store walk for missing signage on product displays throughout the store, which usually takes about 45 minutes to an hour. After that the rest of my day consists of putting up replacement price tags, increases or decreases in product prices, and promotion changes. In terms of management, sometimes I feel like the work  I do is not valued or appreciated. My coworkers are a pleasure to work with. For the most part, everyone is very friendly and approachable. This is probably what i find most enjoyable about the job. I do not necessarily find anything about the job difficult. I know I could be challenged more and hold more responsibilities."
good,"While I thoroughly enjoyed working with my co-workers, management switched often and none of the Store Managers have been liked by the majority. Work shifts were monotonous and sitting was not an option without a medical reason. Many customers took advantage of the ability to return ""defective"" product and produce that they did not use in time. I learned how unpleasant some people can become when they don't get their way and also how to accommodate them to a mutually satisfactory degree."
good,"I did not enjoy working at Weis Markets. Management changed, rules changed often, and everyone was unhappy. I have not met a single person who enjoys working there."
good,A typical day is being on register from start of the day to end of your shift. Gets busy once in a while unless its payday or foodstamp day. I didnt learn anything different from what I already knew. Management had good communication from manager to manager but lacked a little between manager to co-worker. The co-workers are fun to work with. There is no hard part of the job. Nothing was really enjoyable about being on cash register.
good,"Very flexible hours and accommodating to school schedule, Worked there for almost four years. Great work environment."
good,Weis Markets is a great place to work for someone who enjoys social interactions with costumers and fellow employees. Not a bad p[lace to start out your career.
good,"It was a good job but i couldnt see myself making it a career, not enough hours or pay in order to cover everyday living expenses."
good,"This job taught me a lot about working with others that have different outlooks.  While i did learn, the environment is not one that would be ideal."
good,"The Weis  Market was a wonderful places to work. A place to meet new people and grow in confidents. Its important to know your customers needs or worries and attend them. The best part of my job there was to make people happy, even the difficult ones began to like me. My co-workers were helpful in anyway possible."
good,"I'm a Dairy clerk at a store that opened in March 2013. Business is slow. A typical day has me breaking down the truck and working freight on truck days. A non truck day includes working backstock. Also have to pull outdated merchandise regularly and face so that it looks good. Customer service is a big piece. Often times I am the only one on the floor for all of Center Store (HBC, Grocery, Frozen, Dairy) so i get pulled often by customers to those areas for help. I do not plan on staying here very long as my hours are consistently falling...was at 40 now hovering at around 25 or so making it hard to pay bills. My department leader is easy-going and a pleasure to work with. "
good,Management and co-workers were great to be around. Excellent customers and a friendly and fast paced environment. Job was not hard or stressful. The best part of the day is interacting with customers and employees.
good,I worked at this company so long ago. I was just out of high school. I can tell you i made good money and had lots of friends.
good,Been there a  for almost 4 years Decent place to work.  Feel like I hit a ceiling. The pay isn’t  that great. Flexible hours a plus. They will work with me on my schedule.
good,"Had a good time, but the management was extreme. Had a hard time becoming friends with them and they were quite overly strict with clocking in and out."
good,"When it comes to the store as a whole, there are definitely depts that are favored and others that get forgotten. As the saying goes, ""Squeaky wheel gets the oil"" This could not be more true for Weis. When you finally see a manager, be prepared to tell them how many issues you need to resolve before mentioning any issue, as they will dismiss the convo after the first issue if you don't. And you have to talk over the phone? Unless they wrote it down, they forgot instantly."
good,"When I got there I helped push carts from outside. I also helped clean the bathrooms, sometimes even got told to stock items, I listened to what I was being told to do."
good,"produce shift leader"
good,A typical grocery store work environment hindered by poor hiring practices and limited possibility for upward movement within the company. Management ranges from friendly and helpful to completely ineffective and rude.
good,"Easy, basic level grocery cashier. Non-stressful work environment. 95% of job entails ringing out customers and bagging groceries. Work environment fun and friendly for the most part"
good,Schedules were messed up sometimes but it was an overall okay experience. Great place to work as a first job since it gives you loads of customer service experience.
good,"Weis Markets is a great first job that could eventually become a career."
good,"Enjoyed working their but the pay wasn’t fair due to my job responsibilities .when I first started working I was an overnight stocker. Quickly climbed the ladder moved from overnight to deli associate, meat wrapper and finally finished off as seafood manager"
good,Overall for the majority of my job there I enjoyed working for them. As the old managers left and the new managers came in my love for the job went down entirely. They need to learn to better appreciate their employees. The hardest part of the job is the mean customers. Most enjoyable part of the job is when the nicest managers or monitors are on shift. It makes work more enjoyable
good,"typical day involves dealing with customers and there issues, some stocking."
good,Weis is a good place to work your way up and build a resune for yourself but that’s it. They do not compensate fairly compared to industry average or compared to your skills and worth compared to others
good,"If you are an employee that works with the morning crew you will have to be in early to break down the load and work it. The hardest part of the job is your first few days when you are trying to locate where everything goes in the aisles. Management can get a bit confusing. The managers will each tell you things to go and do. Also, they tend to pull you away from the middle of a task in order to go do something else with/for them then give you a list of other tasks to do before you go back to what you had been working on previously."
good,"If your in school this is a great place to work, they are flexible with scheduling. For college grads with student loans, the pay is not great for loan repayment and living expenses."
good,"Some days are harder then others. There's more to a deli then cutting meat. There is fried foods, the rotisserie chicken, stocking the shelves, clean up."
good,"As a receiver, I would be constantly busy unloading trucks and palletizing produce and meat.  Delivering the product to the appropriate departments and cooperating with the department managers. The flow of work went well with very few problems. My immediate supervisor was always nearby if I ran into any questions concerning delivery paperwork or dock scheduling."
good,"High paced, competitive, with ability for promotions . Starting rates below area average and high expectations. Staffing is a challenge in this area.."
good,"After several employees had already quit, my boss set to work to get me to do the same. He was a truly miserable person to be shackled with.  Who, frequently shared his trifle nuggets of ""wisdom"" all the while still living with his parents at the youthful age of 32. Fortunately, he was transferred and I was put in charge. I ran the department until the store was shut down."
good,"A typical day at work for me was either working the customer service desk or having a monitor shift where I was in charge of supervising the front end and making sure it was running smoothly. I learned how to operate registers, conduct good customer service, and basic office work. The management at my store was poor and very two sided. They did not want to work with people and often times would schedule people outside of their availability."
good,"Weis markets is not a bad place to work for but its not a dream job either.its mostly a entry level place to get your feet wet or get back on your feet.the managers are friendly and the staff is nice ,and I do work at my own pace,overall it OK place to work for."
good,"Fast paced work environment."
good,Easy to learn equipment. The hardest part of the job was learning the codes. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people
good,Didn't  like  being  in the  heat. Didn't  mind the  work.  Loved the  customers.  I learned that  it is good to  be  nice  to  everyone. The  hardest part of the  job was pushing  carts and working in the  heat.
good,"Willing to work with employees, yet meets the company's needs also.  Full time benefits are pretty good, insurance, dental, vision & health."
good,"Not an easy job, but it builds patience and awareness,"
good,Working for this company has been good experience for the past 2 years. the co-workers easy to get along with me. i typically work outside which is the most enjoyable part of my jod
good,"In my opinion, working at Weis is a really good ""first job"". It was my first job. Straight out of high school, the amount of work you had to do and the amount you got paid was more than fair. A typical day consisted of stocking the shelves to make sure it was always full and organized and appealing to the eye. My coworkers as well as management were all incredibly supportive and kind all the time. No one ever gave me a hard time. The most enjoyable part of the job was making small talk with customers and just ""BS-ing"" and letting them know that if they needed anything, I would try my very best to get it for them as quick as possible. The hardest part of the job was telling a customer that we ran out of something, fearing that they would be upset with me. It's a pretty good job for someone starting out in the real world overall. I very much enjoyed it while I was there!"
good,"as long as you work hard the job is great, $9.00 per hour, while room for advancement is slim the managers will find a place for you as long as you prove yourself"
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. I was working with school kids as an adult, other than culture shock it was awesome. For me this place made every attempt to accommodate my life and in turn I was able to work and raise my family."
good,I enjoy the job as a cashier at weis. The public and the employees are great. Management is good. I could just use more hours that's why I'm searching for a job now.
good,"A typical day @ Weis markets is fair. Meeting people is good. Did my job well. Making sure the porch is well cleaned as well as the vesilube area. The customers that are supposedly handicapped gets the most attention. Just like everyone else assist them putting groceries in their vehicles. Management has gotten worse, but i have to work with them. My co-workers are very cool to work with. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers."
good,"Weis Markets in Mill Hall PA is not a bad place to work. It is excellent for an entry level job into the workforce as a whole, and if it is stuck with, it can lead you to big opportunities. The opportunity for advancement is great since it is a growing retailer, but the actions upon it are slow."
good,"I enjoyed working at Weis Markets. As I am a people-oriented  person, I really enjoyed working with and assisting my customers. I am very good working with the elderly. When I wasn't assisting customers, I would keep busy, cleaning my working my work area or organize shelves."
good,Everyday coming to work in the morning to go over paperwork. I've learned to develop a routine to schedule my duties. I am in charge of my department and the employees are easy to get along with.
good,"A typical day at Weis Markets was handling cash transactions, customers needs, and making sure all the customers questions were answered and needs were met. However, trying to advance on in the business was rather difficult. The time I spent at Weis was educational and helped me gain customer service experience and I am thankful for that."
good,"-A typical day at work is about 8 hours kind of laid back and since i work in produce I am constantly doing something and its not like deli where you might have customers and you might not."
good,At my job I am trained on five different things. I handle the stores money and make sure everything is running smoothly. I learned that in a workforce area no matter what job team work is one of the most important skills to have. My co-workers are wonderful and listen to me as their front end monitor. The hardest part of my job is keeping up with all the assignments they occasionally throw at me at once. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my co-workers and being there to help them in every way I can.
good,If you like working with the public this is the place to be. You meet all kinds of people from customers to new employees. Love the merchandising part of the job.Love working with the employees. You can learn something new everyday.
good,"I work in customer service. I am also the secondary bookkeeper of the store. I assist customers with paying thier bills, getting money orders, western union, refunds, lottery, etc. My management is very professional and outgoing. My co-workers all work as a team and are cooperative."
good,This job wasn't bad but when management left and new management came in things changed a lot. People started leaving fast after that and I put my 2 weeks in shortly after.
good,it wasn't the greatest kind of work but it got the job done to give me some cash in my pocket and bank account. Good job to start out in but doesn't pay well once you have been there for so long.
good,I don't like the way they treat their long time employees. They push advancements on new employees when they are not ready. They don't care about employes only the numbers
good,Weis markets was my first time actually working at a grocery store. I enjoyed the community and the people and I also loved my co workers. I started as a cashier and eventually moved to a stocking position where I was able to learn the store like the back of my hand and actually subconsciously shop with the customers.
good,"Management went through our store too fast. Four managers in the year I was there and the front end management was cycled through the stores as well. Very inconsistent and hard to follow. No proper training either when I moved up to bookkeeping and then to assistant front end manager. Made it hard to get respect from most employees, very stressful."
good,"I enjoyed working at Weis Markets. It was a very collaborative company and although difficulties may have risen, the work environment did not shift. Every one was encouraging and played an essential role. The managers were fun and understanding and constructed bonds with employees that made working there comfortable."
good,It was a good company to work for. It was very hard to move up in management. But they do teach you how to do a little bit of everything.
good,"excellent. good management.good starting pay people very helpful.Close to home.Benefits are very good.Just started a month ago,need more time to give details."
good,This was a great introduction to being employed. At the time I did not have my license which forced me to resign. This was a good opportunity to build customer service skills along with cashier knowledge.
good,"Working here you get called in early and asked to stay late constantly you will also be asked to come in on your days off."
good,"When I started working there as a teenager in '08, it wasn't that bad.  I was just your average stock clerk with a photographic memory so being able to remember where things were wasn't too difficult.  Although, as 6 years went on, and I was entering my early 20's and had recently graduated, I had to look for something better.  Do I miss working in retail? Absolutely not. Do I miss working with perhaps some of the most honest co-workers who had the same ""Hey, it's pretty lame around here, but let's not bring it down even more so."" Yes.  You can find some honest, hard working people there.  Keyword is some.  Sometimes you get that one guy/girl who just lollygags all day and does absolutely nothing.  But when you get to make some friends, even some from management (maybe about 14% of the higher ups) and some of the actual good customers, it's not a bad start."
good,"I enjoy working there for the most part. I just wish I got paid a bit more and that the schedule was consistent every week. Other than that, the only real complaint I have is that they care more about their customers than that of their own employee’s safety."
good,You have to be very dedicated in terms of working there. You wont have a lot of free time to your self. Environment at the warehouse is stressful and will be difficult if you you don't have a healthy social atmosphere
good,I love working for weis but the pay is too low and i need full time hours but people are nice and we get paid weekly ..................................
good,Work the case in the moring. Break down the truck and fill the cases. Write orders and clean up department. Help all custorms to make sure they are happy and find everything they need.
good,Great place to start working but corporate cares more about their own well being than listening to employees concerns. The company wants you to work work work but will not pay you pass minimum wage. Co workers are friendly.
good,"I've worked for Weis for a little over three years now. It's an great job to learn and grow from. Weis allows employees to move up in the company, given you put the work in. I've learned a lot moving up with through the company, such as, time management, making schedules, balancing invoices, training new hires, and communicating to make a good work environment. I think the part that makes this job hard is the management team of the store. I've had managers who are leaders and want to help motivate the employees to push sales and customer service. On the other hand, I've also had managers who could careless about being understaffed, leading to unhappy customers, and would rather sit in the office and tell others what to do."
good,Weis is a great place to work in. I think that they will help you with whatever you need help with. The people that I work with have always been helpful
good,"I worked at a Weis market that was previously a foodlion and within the first 2 weeks almost everyone quit, im"
good,The co-workers that I work with are very kind and sociable people and I enjoy being part of the family. A typical day at work is lock in take care of the customers and handling money and took clean the area i was at during my shift. I learned different things like how coupons have to be a certain way and the security.
good,"Weis Markets is a decent place to work, it is long hours, a decent amount of standing. The management is decent, and expects quality, training could be better, the hardest part about the job would be the equipment, or lack there of. "
good,You need to really work for any kind of advancement. Well kept and educational. Managers for the location I worked at didn't always do there job.. but they no longer work there.
good,I like helping out the customers and interacting with them. The store rewards the employees with points that can lead to awards like getting a coupon for free food. Customers are like old friends it is easy to start a conversion with them. The store is kept clean as much as possible and it just updated to new freezer and coolers and also self-checkout counters.
good,I think that Weis markets is fun place to work.  This is a grocery store that lets you be very flexable with your time.  They are upfront with demands from the workers.
good,Its alright for a first job but nothing special considering the wage and the hours given. Not something that should be considered for long term work unless you are in a management position.
good,"A typical day at work would be to clock in and turn on my light and start scanning, Weis was a very fast paced job but I really enjoyed it. What I learned at Weis was working with a variety of people, I was learned how to Coupon. The Hardest Part of the Job was when I Injured I stood my 9 1/2 hours. The part of my Job I enjoyed the most was working as a Team!"
good,"Being on the register "
good,"weis was a good job and i met alot of people while working there. there are some good companys you can get in with, witch will lead you to met alot of good people."
good,"overall experience was good other than having issues with humiliation with the monitors "
good,I loved the fast pace work environment at Weis Markets but it is very hard to get benefits and full time hours through the company.
good,Weis definitely had its ups and downs but over all it wasn't as bad as it could have been. Some of the management could have been better but for the most part it was definitely a better place to work then most of the fast food jobs out there.
good,"i was a deli associate there so when i got there i would had to prepare myself for the customers "
good,The people I worked with were nice but the managers where not so professional or manager material. The training was lacking alot. They would have me do something I didn't know how to do in the deli and just leave me all though I told them I didn't know how to o it.
good,I enjoyed working here. But after being there for a bit I realized you only move up if you are cool with certain people not if you do a good job. Also I am a single mother of a 5 month old and they will not work with the schedule I need. I am moving as well
good,"Nice people, safe environment, good place to earn some extra money. Not many ways to advance in positions. Pay is decent, but only able to work up to 32 hours a week."
good,Weis is a good place to work well your going to school and transitioning to a better career. If you work in management then it is also a good place to build your career.
good,Now need to wear uniforms not enough tech help. Front end not supportive of pharmacy. Long shifts with no breaks. Start with only 2 weeks vacation that need to be scheduled a year in advance
good,this was my first full time job and i enjoyed it alot. it was very fast paced and fun. i learned to bake new items and decorate signature cakes for others to enjoy.
good,"I absolutely loved working for Weis. The greatest part was helping all those customers and getting to know and love the people you work with. My co-workers have become more of a family inside and outside of work. Management changed frequently so it was hard to get used to different management styles, however being there and helping customers made up for all of that."
good,"I have learned to benefit in obtaining balance in patience for customers. In order to solve a situation you have to be able to listen, defuse the negative energy and quickly solve the issue at hand. "
good,I loved working with certain people that I am still talking to even after leaving. The customer manager is very understanding and compassionate with a persons personal needs.
good,stocked shelfs. not a bad job for a kid. enjoyed coworkers. fun place
good,"I love working here just because I can work with all kinds of different people and talk with all of the customers that come to the pharmacy. You fill prescriptions and then sell the prescriptions to the customers that brought them in. The training process takes about 6 weeks to get fully acquainted with the environment. Then you are ""set free"" into the pharmacy to fill prescriptions and deal with customers.  Hardest part of the job would be the customers just because there will be some awful customers that you have to deal with, but if you make friends with them then its really not all that bad."
good,"Working there can be fun but management can also be laughing behind your back, literally sometimes depending on where there office is. I know sometimes when I have been standing at the customer service desk with a long line the mangers will sit in the room behind you and just talk and laugh desipe how many times you ask for help."
good,"Pharmacy department is a good place to work in and cannot speak much for other departments.  If your availability matches what they need, it is a great place to work."
good,I consider this job a stepping stone. It definitely helped me get on my feet while giving security of a paycheck. It gave me time to find another career based on a better salary. I learned how to work well with not only the customers but also my coworkers.
good,"Not too bad of a place to work for. Not great about accommodating for having a life outside of work. However pretty fun place to work."
good,Love working with the people there.Wish pay was better and wished they would have more openings for full time. The hardest part of the job is putting all the beer away especially when there is 12 skids of beer. The most I enjoy is helping the customers and putting smiles on their faces.
good,"A very good place to work,excellent co-workers,wages could have been better.Upper mgmt. could have gotten together better,with relaying information to associates."
good,A typical day at work included helping customers with questions they had about items they wanted to purchase or had already purchased. I learned how to react to situations in a professional. Building a close relationship with management was very important especially under stressful situations and my other coworkers were easy to work with as I can usually get along with everyone around me.
good,"Daily review of safety, cash control, exception reporting, internal dishonesty, assisting 18 stores"
good,"I had to assist cutomers ringing out groceries and also had to do customer service which required assiting customers with lottery, western union and bill paying. It was a fun job at times but the managment could have been bettter. I also didnt like only being part time after being with the company 4 years I never got a chance to advance to full time and the pay wasn't good either."
good,"I worked here as a Cashier and in Customer Service. I got to work with many different people and do many different things. As a Cashier I mainly checked out customers and stocked the aisles. But as Customer Service ( I was more in CS) I did numerous things. I would check out customers like normal, but I also was in charge of cigarette, lottery, money order, western union, and bill pay sales. I also aided customers with questions, comments, complaints, returns and exchanges. I also was in charge of managing the cashiers, by sending them on breaks, assigning registers and cash drawers, finding replacements when there was a call off, etc. Also in customer service I was in charge of paging staff members via intercom, verifying documents, incoming and outgoing phone calls, etc."
good,it is a pretty fun work place as a cashier. You get to socialize with coworkers as well as customers. it is a lot of fun and everyone tries to help each other out.
good,"Weis is a great company to work for, the only thing I can think of they can improve is the pay for full time employees. The tag lady (the one who looks like a grumpy toad) was the only issue I ever ever had working here. She had the attitude of a 10 year old and the customers hate her as well."
good,"Everyday is different. "
good,"Work was on the lower end of demanding. I would have to find my own tasks in order to keep busy for the entire shift. I learned how to deal with costumers and how to deal with admin. Management was overqualified, they would generally be workers who got promoted from within. Coworkers are usually not enthusiastic about the work, so they tend to not put the fullest effort in. The hardest part of the job is getting asked to do three separate tasks from three separate people. I enjoyed that I could keep busy and have fast shifts from that."
good,Weis is a great company/grocery store to work for. They are very friendly and flexible with schedules. They will tailor your schedule to work around any issues you may have whether it’s because of another job or school.
good,Weis Markets is a great company to work for because they are locally owned and take great in making sure that their customers are taken care of. I was well trained in my supervisor position of taking care of the front end of the store. I learned to balance my time wisely and how to pick my battles as well and when to let smaller things go.
good,Weis Markets was the most relaxed retailer I have ever worked for. The managers are very personable and will work with you within reason. The store is very family friendly with great prices that encourage regulars.
good,"I enjoy Weis Markets solely because my department manager is great, The hours are flexuible. However, the pay is not enough and the advancement opportunities are slim."
good,"My time at Weis Markets was great because I met some wonderful people and I found something that I really enjoy doing even though it does have difficult times. I've learned better customer service skills, how to manage cashiers and cash registers and I've improved on my leadership skills along with time management skills as well. The management at Weis are a bunch of people who will do everything they can to help someone else out, even if it means going out of their way. The hardest part of the job would be whenever customers were upset or angry about something, I would have to find a way to satisfy their needs or help them feel better about what the situation might have been, without going out of boundaries."
good,In my opinion Weis Markets is OK as a first job but not as a serious career. When management is asked about where they see their employees in five years they have no answer. It is hard to work at a company that raised its minimum wage and yet it didn't change the wages of the other workers that were being paid above that.
good,A typical day at work consist of working with the public to satisfy their needs and wants in a grocery store. I learned different ways to communicate with the public to get better feedback.
good,It was an ok place to work. I worked there as my second job. They were fair to their employees. It helped me through the rough times when i needed a second job
good,"A typical day at work was greeting customers and helping them choose from a variety of deli meats and cheeses. I learned that being polite is the way to treat people, even if they look like they've had a hard day. The management was ok. The co-workers were fun and excellent at what they did. The hardest part of the job, was the short hours. The most enjoyable part of the day was meeting new people every day.  Always made it exciting."
good,"Was an excellent first job, and a great job into my current career. I learned a lot of things that have become the foundation of my experiences. The hardest part about leaving the job was all the friends I had made. Unfortunately the company was not doing well and i felt for job security purposes that I had to leave."
good,"This was a Great job for me in high school, they worked with me whenever I needed off for a school activity. It was fun and pretty relaxed place to work."
good,"a typical day at work would be setting up everything i would be using for that day, printing out labels of the product i would need, i learned alot of experience, the management was very good but at times only thought of themselves. my coworkers were very funny and we all got along great. the hardest part of the job would have to be up early morning hours. the most most enjoyable part would be just being in the bakery. its something i really enjoy doing."
good,"Worked there for three years, advanced in the company the highest i could go before realizing i was going no where. Lack of hours and pay was another issue for that company."
good,Good place to work. You interact with a lot of people and it is easy to find yourdself with pepole you enjoy working with. Work is fast paced and expectations are high.
good,"This location was my first job and taught me a lot about customer service, working together as a group, and time management. There were very little ways to further my career there, and that was why I left."
good,"In my comparison, could do better. Better Pay, Better Hours, and better management. Too many doing easy jobs and not enough on the harder ones such as deli and stocking"
good,"Extremely fun job and great feeling of teamwork.  Simple part-time job, uniform, and scheduling.  Ability to move up in management if so wished (for benefits and long term employment)."
good,"I was a stock clerk for a local weis markets. I helped unload trucks, set up end caps, stock shelves, fronted the store, and assisted with various other duties such as cleaning up product spills and assisting the cashiers with bagging. Also making sure the customer was 100% satisfied, even if that meant loading their groceries in their car for them."
good,"Weis Markets (warehouse) is a very, very fast paced environment  where you are expected to make a quota daily. Can be tough to get the hang of at first but you get use to it."
good,"Weis Markets was a very fast paced and very demanding job, BUT I enjoyed many of my coworkers (and still do, i visit every so often), which made the job much more enjoyable."
good,This was the first job I ever had. I started during High School and continued to work until I became a full time college student. Hours were very flexible
good,Its a good company that pays well and has good hours but a lot of my coworkers complain About how the company doesn't seem to care. A lot of people that were supposed to get a pay increase haven't yet and moving up in the company seems limited especially if someone higher up in the store doesn't want you to. Personally I think I could work somewhere better that pays even more and treats me better as an employee with more benefits.
good,"The job was enjoyable, especially interacting with the customers, looking forward to seeing them the next week, and the flexibility in scheduling, as well as many different shifts available"
good,Nice place to work but the benefits weren't good at all.  They were very flexible with hours.  They did not give you many hours so they can keep more part time employees so don't have to pay benefits.
good,"A decent place to work. Flexible with hours and understand that things happen in life. It is a typical cashier job, but it isn't bad. If anyone needed a job i would recommend. I would not recommend working there if you wanted a to make a career out of it."
good,Its a nice place to work and the are so helpful. It was a great learnig experience. They showed me lot and gave me a lot of skills to move to bigger and better thing.
good,"Starts out early and is hot conditions in the Bakery."
good,"it's a fun place to work with awesome people but the raises aren't fair. i've been working there for 2 years and so far got a .25 raise and recently a .20 raise, they're yearly."
good,"Pros"
good,A typical work day requires a fairly informed knowledge of the store's layout and its relevant sales. My supervisors are always available and my co-workers always ready to assist. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers find what they are looking for but the hardest part is really the repetitiveness or stretches of time without decent business at the cash register.
good,I worked my way up at weis markets; I started out as a cashier and was promoted to customer service soon after getting the job. I worked hard and learned a lot there. I worked alongside many good people and got along great with almost every single co- worker and manager I knew. I was often told I was doing a great job by the store manager and he allowed me move around the store and experience a few different positions. My workplace has a great atmosphere to it and its great to make all the friendships I've had with my co-workers and customers. I will miss working there but I need a job closer to my new home and I would like to make more money then I was there.
good,definitly didnt pay me enough for what i did for this company. i closed 3 departments in 1 night by myself. got nothing for it not even a thank you.
good,"Good Co-worker environment, easily trained in equipment, fun at times."
good,nice co workers. friendly staff. very easy to locate what your lookin for.
good,I normally work night shift so a normal work day for me is slow and not very exciting. The management tries to keep everyone busy as best they can. The hardest part is when we have almost all the registers open and I'm the only one working. And the most enjoyable part is meeting and socializing with tons of new and interesting people everyday.
good,"I loved working at the grocery store. I would always start off washing down my cash register and make it nice and tidy for the first costumer. I would greet the customer with a friendly ""Hello"" and then engage in a conversation to make their cash-out relaxing and fast so they can get home to unpack their groceries. I learned how to talk to people when they're happy and/or upset. My co-workers were very friendly people and they helped me learn how to build and maintain friendships in and outside the company. The hardest part of this job  was when I had to help more than one customer at a time about different issues. The most enjoyable part was chatting with the customers and learning new things about life that I never knew of. This sure did help me with people skills."
good,"Except for the very, very heavy lifting, this was a great place to work."
good,Typical day at work for me is temputures ranging for usally low thirtys up to fifty some days below thirty. Ive learned how to interact with people better and how to opperate different equipment. Ive also learned a little how much it takes to keep everything going constantly with prouduct coming in and going out at the same time. I cant say anything bad about any of my co-workers there great fun and hard working people. Id say the hardest part of my job is working in below freezing tempatures at times. I feel that the people i work with make my job enjoyable.
good,"They do work with you if you have children, the customers are great, it's a clean place to work at, the managers are ok, co-workers like to gossip so you had to be very careful who you talked to and what you said, I don't think I would say it's a great place to work for."
good,"While I was employed at weis, it was slightly understaffed and that made for a super hectic environment. But the pay was okay and the people I worked with were decent."
good,"During the time working here I not only grew as a person, but I was able to grow wit a significant staff as well. I started here when I was 16 and it was my first job and I was able to learn a multitude of different skills."
good,"Learned many new skills, met great people. Store was always clean and neat friendly. I left Weis markets for a career change, nothing personal. You would really enjoy working at Weis."
good,"Maybe it was because of the location and the frequency of customers, but during the day, all associates seem to be extremely stressed, including the managers. Seems to be short staffed more often than not, as well. Otherwise, an ok place to work."
good,"I worked at weis for a year. It was a good job fast paced and I really enjoyed the people I worked with besides maybe a few people but that's everywhere you go. I mean it's customer service your going to get customer service issues. Unfortunately there really isn't a way to move up in the store unless you hassle management for it, because then it's all in who they favorite. I found that in my store it's all about who they favorite really. You'll make anywhere from 1025-1085 depending on how long you work there if your going in to the customer service desk position thinking it pays more forget it cause it really doesn't you'll get paid as much as the person who just got hired"
good,Large enough to be relevant but small enough to be creative. Was interesting to work somewhere where the ceo had conversations with the associates all the time.
good,"I’m very outgoing, reliable, and team player. Willing to try new thing and loves challenges. I’m great at customer service, multitasking, problem solving."
good,"Weis was an excellent place to work, when I first started. Before I left the company, I felt the business changed and not for the better. Management became poor, some workers were very unreliable but nothing would ever be done about, customer service went right out the door with some."
good,"Fairly easy job to learn, once you get the hang of it. Variable rate based pay scale allows you to write your own paycheck within reason but you will definitely be earning the money you do take home with the physical toll. Best bet is to find a good chiropractor."
good,"The store rarely had noticeable messes, employees were pleasant, and management was helpful. A typical work day was go find the manager, do the task that was given, and when finished find the manager and repeat the process."
good,My availability was 8 hours every day but I usually only got two days a week and each day I only got 4 hours. I would constantly ask for more hours but was never given more.
good,I applied at Weis Markets as a summer job after i graduated high school i enjoyed my time at Weis and for a first job it was a good introduction into the working world. I primarily stocked shelves but did get experience working as a cashier and helping in the Dairy department.
good,"As a temporary associate, Weis Markets and all of the employees treated me with the utmost respect. Everyone in the building is friendly, yet motivated to finish their work on a timely manner."
good,"They are an ok company, but I haven't been with them in over a decade, so things can change."
good,"Weis Markets provided me with my first workplace experience and means of income. As a part-time associate, I received minimum wage. The work taught me much about how to function as a member of a corporation and how to properly service customers."
good,"A typical day at work could have been slow but also manageble. It could have also been fast paced an stressful, but there was always someone there to assist you in your time of need."
good,"I worked at Weis for a little less than a year. I made $9 an hour as a cashier and $9.25 as a customer service associate. The managers I had when i first started were great. They kept the store running and were great to work with. The new managers were awful and created a very tense work environment for all. However, working with the customers was usually a fun experience. I would always go back to work for Weis."
good,"A typical day st work is multitasking & doing so many things at once, going back & forth to one thing after another. I learned that you aren’t going to love the job that you’re doing."
good,"This was a good first job, I gained cashier skills and also customer service skills. I liked management more before it was switched and I wish I had better hours. The most enjoyable part is the familiar faces you see. The hardest part is working out hours and scheduling or taking time off."
good,"Customers can be very discouraging, yet they can be anywhere you go. Lots of regular customers which makes comfortable work environment. Good job for part time students. Coopersburg Weis is closing in the 2019 year"
good,work well with others and mostly worked night there worked with me with everything that was going on and there were very understanding and its a okay places to go
good,Days were busy stocking shelves and cutting fruit. They were very flexible with my work schedule. Hardest part of the job was making sure that everything was kept stocked and neat.
good,"I work at weis in the produce dept. Definitely the people make the work fun and entertaining. Managing isnt bad, but there is room to succeed. Also, there is a lot of hours willing to be picked up so there is more money."
good,"very good for someone in school depending on location can be fast paced and stressful or slow and boring. I worked at 4 different locations, had some terrible managers and some I cant live without."
good,"The management is fully understanding and open for change. If you front them with something that is an issue, they will solve it right away. All together they treat you well, but the pay could be better."
good,"Typically i'd work 6 pm to midnight, I learned how to handle bad situations and money at the job. Hardest part of my job was dealing with bad situations and horrible issues, my most enjoyable times were working with people that i knew personally."
good,If the icing was fresh and not in 70lb buckets it would not have been bad. But overall it was not a bad place to work. I got to do what I enjoyed doing that was decorating cakes
good,it was a good place to work just not enough hours. i learned how to cut meat. it was pretty laid back. i did learn alot from this job.the management was great.
good,"work hard and you will get far.(maintence, deli, stock, dairy/ frozen)"
good,"Food Lion however, was very trustworthy. This review may be irrelevant because I mixed weis and food lion together. there is no company in the USA named Food Lion / Weis Markets."
good,Not for any one looking for full time employment. Recommended for students and part time workers. Apply online not in store for the best results wait.
good,"Enjoy working at Weis. Always busy and something to do. Learning to merchandise, food and grocery handling and date/rotation, Customer service and register use."
good,"- typical day consisted of greeting customers and scanning their items "
good,weis is a productive work place with a high paced environment working at a very fast pace the most enjoyable part of the job was working hand in hand with the managers to increase sales
good,This was my first job. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. I enjoyed my job in the produce department. It was a fun job. I only left due to schooling.
good,"To be honest, working in the grocery/dairy departments at Weis weren't that bad, even though sometimes they really didn't schedule enough people in the back, which sometimes left me, a kid a few months in to the job, as the only one manning the Dairy department. It was alright, though I wish that they pulled one of the cashiers to pull carts, though they didn't really have enough cashiers at one time to do so... It was a good job, though, and I met some good people there."
good,Weis Markets is a good job for someone looking for supplemental employment. The job is fairly easy but the pay is not so great. Opportunities for advancement are minimal
good,"Solid pay, Managers and supervisors are very friendly, they teach you all that you need to know ensuring that everything is done safely and properly at all times."
good,Working for Weis Markets was a very rewarding 10 years. Pleasant management and caring co workers. Very understandable with life circumstances when scheduling.
good,The coworkers and job were great but the pay could have at least been close to the state average. I loved my experience there and would still be there if I didn't need money to survive.
good,"Assisted customers, greeted them as they walk upon the store. Cash handling cleaned and maintain cash station, cashed out customers and assist their needs."
good,"Liked my managers and co-workers.  Fast paced, but good working environment.  Responsible for all deli equipment and maintaining a safe environment for customers and associates."
good,Fun place to work with great co-workers. Management works well with you and your schedule. As a deli associate I enjoyed getting to know my customers.
good,You typically work from 9- 7 or whenever your tasks are complete. You unload the trucks using power jacks. Then you take the merchandise to the sales floor and stock the shelves putting all new merchandise that just came in in the back. You only have to deal with customers for about an hour or so as the store usually closes around 10 or 11.
good,"I really enjoy working here and the people are awesome to work with. It is a good work environment and the hours can be good. Some weeks are not as good with hours and that needs to improve. Basically, it is cashiering most days as well as stocking. My co-workers are cool, but some I do not like. That is everywhere though. The hardest part can be dealing with certain customers, but you just have to give them the best service you can. The most enjoyable is being around the people I like and getting noticed by customers on great service and also praise from my manager."
good,This is a good place to work if you are in college. They are very good at working with you as far as any scheduling conflicts. I started off as cashier and was moved up due to my ability to learn quickly and my reliability.
good,"Team work among employees is very prevalent, and many of the workers show enthusiasm for getting work done. I am a big fan of Weis."
good,"The enjoyable part of job was meeting the customers and learning about meal ideas from them. "
good,I had an enjoyable work experience with this company. Very friendly atmosphere and nice people to work with.  Night shift was a little hard to get used to but not bad.
good,"A good place to start for a first job to a career. Flexible hours from what I remember. Management was fair. If you were a hard worker and got your job done nobody bothered you if your a loner. All in all, a good experience."
good,"A typical day/night at work is a lot of teamwork to get everything done. I've learned how to interact with people more and work together to get everything done along with satisfying customers. Management is good at the store I reside in, they will always help in a time of need and listen to their workers. My co-workers are the greatest people. We all have such great teamwork and consistently work together to get everything done. The hardest part of the job is definitely when its busy and we don't have enough help, but with the teamwork we all have, it makes it easier and we always get everything done. The most enjoyable part would definitely have to be the atmosphere. Between the management, co-workers, and even the customers, we all have a special relationship with each other and that's what makes it so great."
good,"Weis Markets is a great place to work, it is fast paced, and requires an energetic and goal focused individual. having an open schedule seems to be ideal, but they will work with you if there are certain days or times you cant work"
good,"Each day at Weis was different, but had the same concept we would follow.  For instance the mornings started with pulling items that were to expire the next day, shrink the product that was expired, fill tables as needed (including thaw & sell products or items needed to be baked), review weekly ads and ensure all products listed are available or make more, make special orders, receive and put away stock, including ordering stock, print off daily/ weekly profit, meet and greet customers, help them in anyway possible, as well as keep a clean work space.  Overall, kept busy all day, ability to multi- task is a must."
good,"A typical day usually requires Associates to take care of their respective department. These duties include but aren't limited to; filling displays, organizing products, rotating aforementioned products by their respective expiration date, composting expired products, cleaning floors, disposing of garbage, interacting with customers on a basic social level."
good,"Well at work I greet people and ring them up on a cash register, I pretty much do whatever the managers ask of me. If that means doing the trash to working in another department. I've learned very well communication skills how to greet people and talk to them and understand their needs in any case. I also learned multiple departments meaning bakery, frozen, grocery so I pretty much do it all. The management isn't all that great one manager is disrespectful. Coworkers well I get along with everyone there they treat me with kindness and always ask how I am. The job isn't too difficult. The most enjoyable pat is when I help people and give them great customer service."
good,Independent type of work. Always fun to interact with co-workers in the meat department. Manager is flexible with scheduling which helps a lot.
good,si faceva manutenzione e costruzione dei macchinari di perforazione
good,"A typical day involved stocking merchandise and goods, handling money, being friendly to customers, supervising other employees. "
good,The bookwork and accounting was fun I like working with numbers. As the cash office clerk I counted the cash drawers for over and short and balanced the books.
good,"This is where I learned the value of hard work and dedication.  While I was in High School and College, Weis Markets allowed me the flexibility to grow while still contributing to a successful business."
good,"It's pretty disorganized but an overall okay place to work. The managers can be unhelpful, but the general work environment is pretty good."
good,working at weis was a great experience. it was fun and there was never a dull moment. you get to meet great people and ;earn new things.
good,"Even though I only got to work part time I was able to enjoy the hours I was given. Working in the Deli/Hot Foods was quite simple work, but it did take a lot of multitasking. Not only did I have to make the food and prep it, but also take care of the customer's needs and questions at the same time. It was a great experience to not only to work with people who were easy to get along with but meeting and getting to know  customers was always interesting."
good,"Jobs in the Bakery Department are demanding and require many tasks to be completed in a short amount of time. A Bakery Associate must be able to multi-task to complete all of the orders and stay on top of the inventory, and be helpful to customers. However, you will also be able to use your creative ability to make attractive cakes and cupcakes and you will learn decorating skills."
good,A typical day at work for me was helping customers at the customer service desk & helping fellow associates. I have learned a lot while making my start in retail at Weis Markets. The biggest thing I have learned was how to work in customer service and how to handle difficult situations. My management and co-workers were very nice. The hardest part of the job was when there were only two registers open in the mornings and long lines of customers. The most enjoyable part of the job to me was just working with people and being able to make people smile.
good,"customer service, cashier, and clean up. I rang up customer purchases.  Made sure my area was clean. Answer any question they might have."
good,lot of work to do not enough people with enough hours to get the job done right. good fellow workers. early morning starts get some stuff done before we got busy.
good,"As a stock clerk, I typically came in and filled shelves; made lists of what was needed in aisles; changed end caps on Saturdays and kept aisles and backroom organized. Really had the opportunity to grow my organizational, interpersonal, and detail oriented skills. The current center store manager is by far, the hardest working employee at the store, and very understanding when dealing with issues of scheduling and other situations throughout the store."
good,my job was a typical place to work at. Our customers were always polite my co workers also. my enjoyable moment was a customer always made my days with laughs. as for management the hardly had coverage but on my days off I come in to help. I care a lot about the company and how short they were. if I had to say the hardest part of my job was the hours being cut a lot
good,"Greeting the customer, helping them with any question they had and helping them with their transaction while standing for 6 to 8 hours"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is that I learn something new every day, whether it deals with helping a customer with an issue or solving a problem on the front end. "
good,cashier/ customer service desk! Great first job for student or someone just entering in the work field. I enjoyed talking to customers and helping with their needs.
good,"Great college job. Understanding with scheduling conflicts, always a warm and pleasant workplace."
good,"people. good leadership.. lacking in some areas.,. growth"
good,"loved working there, because i love to bake, the only hard thing was unloading trucks for material"
good,"Typically I worked night shifts which still being in high school at the time was perfect. The job started out great giving me 9 hours a shift about 4-5 day per week. Unfortunately, while being employed there for a few months the next coming year they had a lot of changes to their minor employee rules and could no longer give me more than a 4 hours shift. I quickly began to lose hours and money there being the reason I left. I got along with everyone i worked with so well that It took me an extra month longer to quit. The hardest part of being a cashier there was just dealing with dramatic and traumatic situations such as huge winter storms and having technical issues just put a lot of stress on yourself. But over all i enjoyed my customers, I had regulars who always came to my line and I had good friends I got along with."
good,A great job for those of us who enjoy being around people of different lifestyles and for full time college students.
good,"A typical day is waiting on customers, answering their questions, and helping them to their car when help is needed. I've learned to listen to customers and their concerns, and how to maintain the self serve lanes. Management is fairly easy to get along with as well as the co-workers. The hardest part of my job is listening to customer complaints about not having enough cashiers on, knowing you can't do anything to fix the complaint. The best part is meeting new people and getting to know them on a first name basis."
good,the work hours were exactly what i needed and management would help with family needs down in baltimore when i needed a day to tend to family affairs. the hardest part of my job was when i had to resign to move back to baltimore to take care of my ill mother. i enjoyed all aspects of weis.
good,all i did was get in wash my hands then started either asking customers what they needed. wiped slicers off or did dishes. it was fast pace sometimes. you really have to remember numbers to do this job. hardest part of this job was when i first started and didnt know what to do. easiest part was cleaning up at closing time. My manager was nice. my coworkers and i didnt all see eye to eye.
good,My typical day at work was dealing with the cash office. I was also in charge of the front-end cashiers. I was the store trainer as well as compliance officer. I was also the Night Manager
good,Assisted customers with purchases customers as well as assisting around the store.
good,Purchase products for warehouse. Follow through with late shipments with vendors
good,"Great, fast paced learning environment with high expectations. Limited compensation. Good health insurance."
good,"Definitely a company that rewards good work... in due time. The people make the job, the employees and customers alike."
good,Easy to incorporate daily life into work place. Also great at letting employees take days off when needed or make up hours for missed days.
good,It all started here. Nice environment. Fun co workers. Some room for advancement but not much.
good,"Good for improving customer service skills, same routine every day, top management could use improvement"
good,"I really enjoyed this job. I had amazing co-workers and customers. Yes, there were days that weren't so good, but that can happen with any job. The only downfall with this job was that I was working full time while still in High School and my grades started to drop."
good,"I do not have much to say. The job is good, pay is minimum and energy is good. They took me in and gave me my first job ever and showed me what a work life was. I appreciate them."
good,"Weis is a good place to work, employees are friendly and courteous to each other.  It is a good place to work if you are wanting part time and full time, they work well around your schedule."
good,"I will say it is more of a solo operation than a team style of job."
good,Weis hired me to work part time. I've expressed interest in transitioning to full time status and asked about other positions. I've been told that there are none available and it's time for me to move into a career.
good,"On a typical day of work, I would be running a register and counting money. I would be assisting customers with locating products. While working here I've gained more knowledge on customer service, and being a better employee."
good,Worked the cash register all day. Did inventory over night once a week. Generally pretty easy job once know how to work register. As a front end monitor I ran breaks of all other cashiers
good,Weis I would recommend for a teenager just starting out and is looking to make a few extra bucks. High school like environment and the customers tend to try to talk down to you. But then you get that one customer that is completely amazing and they make you realize why you do what you do.
good,"It was a good job to officially start off with. Meet new people, make connections, learn how to handle money and interact with customers and coworkers. Easy going."
good,"A typical day at work includes clearing out the queue and ensuring it stays clear, talking with insurances, helping customers - not only with their prescriptions but helping them find items within the store such as minor medical supplies. "
good,"Being a manager you take on more responsibility and being in foodservice as a Deli mgr it tends to be a swinging door dept.  Always training and filling orders, delegating job responsibilities and covering schedule when there is a no show or call off. Very fast paced and the days flew by.  The best part working with the customers and getting ideas from them for items to carry if available. This type of position you really became aware of time management. The long hours and getting up early to start over again really became a struggle with a longer drive as well.  With nasty roads in winter management became very understanding."
good,Weis markets is not a bad place to work. They need better health insurance options. They also need to take care of the associates a little better with holidays.
good,Weis Markets is a good place for a first or second job and pays well for someone like a teenager in high school with minimal bills or who is looking for a good part time job with friendly coworkers.
good,It’s a good place to get your feet wet. It’s also great for students who go to school and need some easy money .. The employees are also friendly and easy to get along within
good,"This job has taught me many skills dealing with the customer service environment. From balancing money, customer complaints, time management, multi-tasking, etc."
good,"Weis Markets like a lot of retail business is understaffed especially in the area I work.  It can be a very challenging day sometimes, but I thrive on being busy all day. "
good,The coworkers and the managers were great to work with.  They didn't want to give the breaks that you were able to take other than your lunch.  Very good location.
good,I worked third and ran register and self scans as well as stocked the shelves. You were trusted to do your work without the boss standing over your shoulder. They were near by so if you needed anything you just had to give a holler.
good,"Worked on the Front end, dealing with customers and ringing them out. As well as making sure the customers are happy with how things were handled and if they were satisfied with their shopping experience."
good,I like working there and I like my coworkers just need something fulltime first shift if they could do full time id probably stay there the managers are very nice tho very relaxed enviroment
good,I work part time in the produce department.  I prepare fruits and vegetables for customer purchases.  My department has 2 full time and 4 part time associates.  We have a great team.  Everyone has their own responsibilities but also we help eachother out daily.  I enjoy my job & look forward to my day-to-day duties.  Each day is different & that keeps it fresh & fun.  We have a great time and still get the job done.   Since I am part-time my negative is the low pay scale & annual raises which are not substantial.
good,"Working for Weis Markets, I was able to develop my management skills in a variety of locations. It required long hours and sometimes depending on the store) I had to drive a long distance. The environment is overall pretty friendly, but very stressful. Being a manager requires working nights and weekends as well."
good,"Usually when I go into Weis it is a fairly easy job. Obviously if you don't get things done in a certain amount of time then youll fall behind, however Weis is a good place to work. I go in and get my things done usually no questions asked. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people, the people that are in my department make it hard to work sometimes because we can't stop talking. Ive learned a lot and I know that weis will continue to grow."
good,"The average day at Weis Markets was slow, but not necessarily bad. I worked in the Seafood department, which was generally fairly slow for the store in which I worked. The other employees said hello everyday when I walked in, and I often joked with the customers to lighten up the mood. I learned most of my cleaning methods at this job, as seafood requires a lot of cleaning and maintenance. The manager was pretty friendly overall. He didn't really notice me, whether I did my job right or wrong, but I suppose that's better than constantly getting in trouble. The most enjoyable part of the interaction with the customers. Most of them were very personable and had interesting stories for why they were buying seafood, despite the store being in the middle of farmland."
good,a job like weis is good because everyones work schedule needs can be met.the people you work with are friendly and work together . working with the public can be hard but at a grocery store I find it nice because you end up handling and getting to know your regular customers.
good,"The best place about Weis is the management - they are encouraging, understanding, and kind. Other than that it's what you would expect from a grocery store."
good,Greet customers as they arrive. Check customers out when they are ready. Assist customers when they have questions. My co-workers are all kind and easy to get along with.
good,"First job. Management taught me the business world and gave me room to advance. Worked through college."
good,"Working at Weis was a good two year, it had its ups and downs, the big problem was that we went through mangers basically every other month. They really weren't that well with going with peoples schedules, or when they were available, they just really put you in where ever and if you actually went to them to complain a few thousand times then they would fix it."
good,"Nice and helpful co -workers. Good place to work. Friendly people."
good,"Typical Day- arrive early and clock in at the earliest moment (5 minutes before scheduled shift), relieve staff and then proceede to organize my area for my shift. Assist customers throughout the shift with any need I can fulfill. Assist coworkers when the store becomes busy. Close the store for 3rd shift to start. Leave only when work is completed and satisfactory."
good,Most employees are friendly and helpful. Acknowledged for good work and helpfulness to customers. Able to be cross trained in other departments for more flexibility and hours.
good,"From 2012 to 2015 I was a cashier for Weis Markets. I enjoyed this job because I was able to be quick on the cash register, provide excellent customer service, and bring a great experience to our guests. I enjoyed straightening up the grocery store, doing paper work for the managers, and helping out other departments whenever it is needed. This was the first job that I have ever held, and it was a great real-life experience for my future."
good,"Deli associate - my duties were to wait on customers in the deli in a courteous manner , pepare orders , to the customers satisfaction,I took phone order to party trays and pizza orders when needed.I made pizza for store sales and customers orders. On certain days I was in charge of the food service section of the deli where I made different types of fried foods and rotissirie type chicken . At this job some days were hard because you had some people that were not team player and chose to do what they wanted to do which made the work at times, meaning you had to be two places at one time. The hardest part sometimes was just keeping enough food cooked for store sales especially if that item was on sale.."
good,"On a normal day you walk into your department, get your daily task list and start onto your workday. I learned a lot from this company that I will bring with me to future jobs. The Produce Manager Tom was a standup guy and wants to teach. Management was down to earth and friendly, willing to teach what they know. Co-workers were very easy going and a pleasure to work with. The hardest part was time management and getting everything done. Had to break down load and keep team on task to complete everyday projects."
good,"Being the Night Crew Leader I oversee overnight operations performed by my crew. We are responsible for stocking the truck, facing grocery, HBC, frozen, and dairy, in addition to working back stock, and writing down out of stocks for grocery and HBC/GM. Everyone on night crew are hard working and I thoroughly enjoy working with them. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the store manager opening every day, they are extremely disrespectful to everyone. If that person wasn't in charge, I wouldn't be looking for a new job."
good,A typical day at work is I set the case in the sea food department by putting all the shrimp and fish in the case then I check for date on stuff in the walk up. I learned how to steam crab and shrimp. management is pretty good and there really good at what they do. the hardest part of my job is not knowing to much about fish when someone ask me about it. I get to talk to customers.
good,As a cashier a typical day at work consists of showing up and providing customers with fast and friendly service as your ring up their groceries or help answer questions. Learning everything about the register is super easy and most people catch on within their first day of training. The hardest part of the job is having some customers yell at you about stuff you cannot on control. You just have to learn how to keep calm and make everything right so the customer is happy. I love all my co-workers and managers. We have a very friendly and fun environment.
good,"Very good place to start, pay is very low though, and they don't really give huge raises.  Very flexible with your schedule."
good,"A typical day at work was fun. "
good,Excellent place to improve current job skills. the staff are very friendly and helpful to new people.
good,The job is fast paced in certain departments which makes the time fly by quickly but your opinion is many times not acknowledged and can make successfully doing your job difficult.
good,Has great benefits. Long days. No weather delays or cancellations when there should be some. Upper management is not the best. Customer service lags in stores. Need more cashiers.
good,"havent worked there in 10 years, not sure what all has changed"
good,"Interact in a friendly manner with customers "
good,Most enjoyable part of job was meeting new people everyday.
good,"Customer interactions could be overwhelming. Assisting monitors with overrides, price checks, and additional cashier needs. Covering breaks. Variety of job responsibilities."
good,"At the time of my employment I was a front ends associate. I worked the register , self check out & sometimes i helped grocery in their department if need be. The management kind of sucked , they were cool but they did not communicate with eachother at all. I had to change my schedule 4 times until someone finally went in the system and changed it. But since i left they fired the general manager and replaced him with someone who is very easygoing and replaced a couple other managers as well, i can see a huge turn around. I was even supposed to return and work in the grocery department but i chose to go back to school instead"
good,Weis was my first job and the availability allowed me to focus on school. I worked about 24 hours a week and only 4 hours on a school day allowing me to get good grades.
good,Weis markets has been a stable job that I've worked for 7 years. The benefits are good and you are guaranteed 40 hours a week at full time. However the pay rates are low and room for advancement is scarce.
good,"Weis markets is an overall okay company in my opinion, I don't really have an issue with them and I think they're okay for the most part but being in a store where corporate is constantly at is very stressful. being a department manager like myself you have little to no help and are expected to do every little thing in the department by yourself. They expect you to clean film milk fill eggs (In the dairy department) complete the rest of the truck, order, cut your order, keep up with all the items that are selling that you have to refill constantly, Dairy markdown (coupons) And it's really stressful It honestly is. The pay isn't the best whatsoever I'm literally only making $12 an hour working 40+ hours a week with people in my department that can care less because they are not full-time like me and then I get the blame for it. keep in mind this is just my personal experience with this company and with other people it may vary but if you can handle stress And are willing to put a lot of time and effort into this company you will do well."
good,"I liked working here at first,it was a good job and they were very understanding with my schedule and the management was awesome. They ended up hiring some new management that did not treat the employees well. I ended up searching for another job because of the conflicts."
good,Good place to work at easy to adapt too and very respectable customers . time goes slow working here as a cashier so find something like reading a magazine or sum at your register
good,"One of the many pros of working at Weis Markets is improving on my communication skills. Whether that's communicating with people who are mentally challenged, those that speak little to no English, younger, and/or older people. I've been able to improve on my customer service skills as well. I am able to assist customers to the best of my ability, with or without a manager."
good,"Weis markets is my favorite place so far they’ve taught me patience is key, i’ve learned so much being a cashier at weis markets, i would suggest weis to all of my friends if i could."
good,General management positions are generally promoted from within.  An excellent company to work for with advancement opportunities if your willing to put in the effort to succeed.
good,"Weis Markets is a good place to gain experience in retail. While you will be assigned directly to your position you've applied for a few weeks, they will encourage you to work in other departments when needed. This can help you gain confidence in your skills and experience in other areas. Of course, there isn't any legal obligation to work other than where you've signed up for. "
good,"This store always had something to make working each day interesting! It was also great to meet all the people that would come through my line. At times it could get a little crazy, but once it slows down, you wish you could get it back!"
good,Weis Markets is a pretty good place to work. They are willing to work with you on times in and out. if something happen and you need to go home they are understanding just don't make it a every time thing
good,"Typical day at my job can be very hectic from changing price tags, to making signage for displays, to constantly checking emails t make sure nothing important is missed or to even doing aisle scans for every item. I've learned so much since being here and continue to learn something new everyday. The management team at my job are very professional always want you to succeed but also hold you accountable and themselves for anything that gets messed up Very fast paced workforce depending upon what you do but you will always be busy."
good,I was there for 2 years but never saw a raise that I was due. I was doing the work for a full time job but not being compensated for it. It was only after I left that management realized I was being paid $3 below where I was supposed to be for the work I was doing.
good,"For me the job is currently to just to make ends meet. However it is still a great job and they take care of their employees. I am a warehouse selector so I drive a pallet jack around to fill orders I am given. It is physical work, but it pays well and the benefits are amazing. They give an incredible amount of incentives, overtime and holiday pay as well."
good,Weis was a fun place to work for the 3 years I worked there but that was only because of my coworkers. Some managers were also fun and would make your shift feel more like fun than work. Our store manager was terrible I don't even know how he still is employed.
good,The job was fairly easy. Employees were easy to get along with. Customers could be a pain at times but you do what you can to make sure they are satisfied.
good,Hours are supposed to be 50 or less unless running after hours calls. Oncall 24/7/365 unless on vacation. You can push calls to back up if you need to which helps with flexibility. Manager is helpful and involved but not pushy. Same problems as all corporations of this size. Slow to change and poorly thought though and executed solutions. Need to slow down and produce good solution while communicating progress.
good,I worked there almost ten years. Coworkers are great customers are great. Management team is always very helpful and there to assist if needed any. Flexible with scheduling
good,Very stressful being a manager. Upper management is very demanding. Did not want my good health to be affected by the job. Associates hours are cut on a regular basis to meet payroll goals set by the company.
good,"Overall, a good first job. It is easy but can be stressful. Front end is a good place to work at first. Minimal progression but in high school that is totally okay"
good,"It was a part-time job when I was a high school student just looking for some extra cash. Some people did work there for an extended period of time, but most don't. The number of teenagers there is much larger than those who aren't."
good,The job itself was okay. The only thing was they would schedule you for certain days and then make you work days you weren’t scheduled for. They are strict with call offs even if it’s an emergency
good,"While working at the Store closest to me, I was able to advance in my Department and even train in other Departments."
good,"My store was super busy all the time, but management was fun and my coworkers were awesome! Benefits nonexistent though and pay wasn't the best. 7/10!"
good,"this is a good place they don't really offer full time so its a part time job for the right person at least 32 hours per week so it isn't bad. have to be a hard worker, very kind managers, though management doesn't have enough concern for their staff they have respect for them which is more than most"
good,There is always room to advance within the company. The management acknowledges the hard work that you put in and will always be willing to help you improve yourself within the company.
good,"Weis is a good place to work in general. Overall coworkers are nice, but of course customers can be trying sometimes. Also, at my Weis location, Management shifted a lot. We would get used to one terrible assistant manager and then a few months later we would get a new one."
good,Overall it's really not a bad place to work. Pretty easy job. Nice coworkers. The discount was pretty cool. You have to purchase non slip shoes or youll be given little pull over ones.
good,The department manager was fabulous and great at making sure people were working hard but treated fairly. One of the store managers was uncaring and made the work week harder. This job requires you to be fast and smart because if you are not you could get seriously injured.
good,great people to work with. flexible shifts. great team work. well trained in the job. Mangers are reasonable people to work with. benefits were okay. pay could be better
good,I learned that it is who you know and not how hard you work. My current bakery manager is great. She worked for everything and works very hard. I want to be a similar manager.
good,"It was nice working with some of the people but there were many supervisors that were ""clicky"" and cared more for gossip than whether someone needed help."
good,"The culture in the pharmacy department is not as stressful and cut-throat as I assume many chain pharmacies are. The hours can be long, but you get more days off per week because of it, standard with most pharmacist positions. The technician help is lacking due to low compensation, but it seems standard to other pharmacies."
good,There are multiple positions and locations which makes this a good job for a variety of individuals.  There is room for advancement and lateral changes as well.
good,but.. if you do like to work when the customers aren't around then this just may be the job for you. As long as you got your work done you could leave early. flexible breaks.
good,I believe in recent years the company has gained good service for the customers while obtaining a good working environment for the employees. Has made great growth potential for employees internally.
good,"I only work 3 days a week for the company. It is a nice job for part-time hours. I would like to be able to receive more hours and pay but I am at the maximum part time hours, and they do not hire full time. "
good,"Weis is an okay job, not what was expected. Has been cutting hour a lot recently for a lot of people. This Weis is located on Front street in Binghamton, NY. If you're looking for a majority of 2 to 3 days a week this is the place you'd like to work. Workers answer all questions if they know them."
good,"Usually holding interpersonal conversations with everyone. Keeping everything clean. I enjoyed the customers the most. The worst was not getting days asked off for court, class, last minute family emergencies."
good,"I felt it was a great place to work and the people are amazing."
good,"I loved all of my coworkers, I enjoyed my time with Weis and I would return in the future sometime. My managers were very considerate and everyone worked well together."
good,"Pending the day, and pending the season, this job could steadily remain busy and active. I enjoy being busy and remaining on my feet helping customers at my fullest extent."
good,"Work is nice when you can work as team, but everyone does nothing but complain about pay. Wasn't a terrible place to work for, just wanted new opportunity."
good,I enjoyed my job very much. Was the first warehouse job i ever had and i did my job well. I learned my job duties very quickly and received certifications in a few areas and worked a lot of overtime.
good,"I pushed carts from the corrals to the porch, gathered baskets from the registers and took them to the store entrance, and helped customers with loading their cars and finding things in the store.  I never really had a problem with management except the one lady who was the store manager, but no longer works there.  My co-workers were pretty nice."
good,"cleaning my work area around my register, checking my customers items out and bagging. learned how to help customers with the self-check out registers."
good,"-Clean registers/work area, help customers, keep lines down, make sure cashiers have adequate change, show customers where items in the store are "
good,"Set rooms to meet the needs and demands of guests. Serve weddings, group parties, and business meetings."
good,"A typical day at Weis Markets definitely varies day to day. Your day could either be very slow and boring if we are not that busy, or if it is busy, your day is fast-paced and it goes by really fast. You encounter all sorts of people. It's debatable whether or not to say its loads of fun, but it it's alright."
good,I enjoyed working at weis. I was never really bored and enjoyed the employees i worked with! Very friendly environment!
good,"i unloaded trucks, put merchandise away, stocked dept. did ordering of product, made schedule for employees. ilearned how to be a negotiator and have an open mind. loved my coworkers. hardest part of job was motivating people but most enjoyable was a repeat satisfied customer"
good,"Learnt lot of technology, not a convenient place to live, some where in PA"
good,"A typical day at the office involves many phone calls, tracking data, and completing time-sensitive tasks.  Job duties are varied, eliminating ""job boredom"".  The hardest part of the job was taking phone calls from people whose loved ones had passed on.  The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting fellow-associates with their HR/Benefits needs."
good,"At weis I was committed to our customers and community. From the moment I walked into the store I was positive. I would clock in and get right to the register, ready to start. I learned how to work with money and a register for the first time. The hardest part of my job was deciding to leave. "
good,Weis is an interesting place to work for. They give you opportunities to try other departments.
good,"The managers here were great to me when I was working there. I worked there for about a month. Although I enjoyed working there, I left due to personal issues."
good,"A typical day at work was checking out items for customers, handling WIC and food stamps."
good,Flexible hours
good,"I love this company and everything they stand for. I recommend Weis Markets to anyone. Great culture, management, fellow associates, and customers are all great and help to define Weis as a great company."
good,I have worked with Weis for multiple years and have grown to learn many things about the company as well as professional environments in general. Management is clear and hours are flexible and fair.
good,Spent many years at weis people are friendly courteous respectful. Money was far good balance between home and work. Overtime if you wanted to. Poor health care.
good,"Na, it has been years since I have worked at Weiss markets. It has changed so much, at first the quality went down but they brought it back up with new management."
good,Wasn't there for long because I was going off to college but the other Night Crew employees were good and management was good as well. They had flexible work hours and made the night crew feel welcomed.
good,Working at weis markets was enjoyable because of the people you are around. The management there was not very friendly. You felt very under apperciated.
good,"This was probably the best job that I ever had in my life, the pay was incredible and the benefits were also great, they treated me with respect and allowed me all the overtime I wanted."
good,They worked well with my schedule.  I liked the people I worked with.  One of the hardest part of the job is when other people call off then you have to pick up the slack.  Good job overall.
good,I loved the job because the co-workers are very understanding and considerate of other people especially the customers. You can see how much they care!
good,"I have worked for this company for three years, and I have found that coworkers and management are very encouraging and friendly. They stress the importance of making the store a welcoming place for customers, but the welcoming aspect often carries into the relationships you develop with your managers and coworkers. I never imagined some of my coworkers could make me smile as much as they do. Also a bonus: paid breaks and 30-minute unpaid lunch, decent pay, and a fast-paced environment that will not allow you to feel bored. I have learned a lot about what customers appreciate and what keeps them coming back. The hardest part of the job can be keeping on top of tasks while taking adequate care of customers, because sometimes departments are understaffed."
good,"Overall, Weis was a goo place to work and most of the people on my level were great to work with. Unfortunately the company is strangled by incompetent managers who seem to have no clue what they are doing. Managers being transferred to different stores is a monthly occurrence. One thing that did impress was that if you worked hard you would be promoted quickly."
good,"Weis Markets was the first job I ever had, like everything is has its pros and cons.  It's a good first job for high school and college students. Very flexible with working hours, especially if you are very active academically and with extracurricular activities."
good,I started with bring the carts in and loading customers groceries. Moved up to cashier pretty quickly. Was a fun job but did not pay enough compared to other part time jobs in the area.
good,A typical day at Weis is very steady. Some days we do get busy but everyone manages to pull through. A lot of the time co-workers are what make the day go by quickly generally most custmoers are very nice and understanding.
good,"Lots of great people to work with. They could offer more but if your just looking for part time work it’s a great place to work. Managers are great, very easy going."
good,"A very busy fast paced market with great employee interaction I learned great skills and received a Safeserv Certificate in food safety, Management...."
good,overall the job was good but I didn't have opportunity for advancement and my pay couldn't sustain me. I really think its a good company for people just starting out.
good,"Helping customers, selling fish and seafood, my manager is awesome, he is very understanding. The work place is very diverse. There isn't a hard part, I enjoy interacting with customers and helping them chose the seafood that they enjoy or even try something new."
good,"was a cashier for a short time until I found a medical job I was searching for. Enjoyed my coworkers, they were very professional, helpful and always helped me when needed with my hours or days of work."
good,turned out to be a really fun job. loved my coworkers and they made the day go by faster. customers can be rude but management always had our back. it was relatively easy to catch on working the register.
good,"It is a small store, so it doesn't get too busy unless there is a holiday. There is a lot of teamwork involved. The management is very helpful in trying to get you to succeed."
good,"Every time that I go into work, I don't know what to expect. Since the managers trust me so much, I get handed off to do odd jobs around the store and in every department. It is a nice change up that makes work enjoyable for me."
good,"Not a terrible job, definitely room for growth if you are looking for that. Management could have been better, breaks could have been better. But overall I am happy to have gained the experience of working there."
good,The work at Weis Markets is fairly standard among grocery stores. In the grocery department a fair amount of leeway is given for an individual to determine how their work day will go. The managers are wonderful and the fellow co-workers are usually very easy to get on with. The physical work in the grocery department is rather strenuous and can lead to wear and tear on the body. Overall working at Weis Markets is a solid choice for anybody looking for part-time employment.
good,At weis markets the customers coming in was steady and there is rare moment when there isn't something to do. The workers there are friendly and don't mind helping each other out.
good,"I would start my day opening a register and handling cash, then often times I would switch to open the seafood counter. I learned to handle money and how to greet/interact with Customers. the management at Weis markets really understood how to run a business and was very focused on customer service. it was a good environment to work in because I was able to talk and meet many new people and form close relationships with frequent shoppers. the hardest part of this job was the fact that I had to run the seafood counter alone it sometimes got stressful but it was overall a great experience. the most enjoyable part of the job was definitely that I had the opportunity to form bonds with employees and customers and keep the business running well."
good,"I was a cashier and store attendant, tasked to solve issues with customers in a timely and respectful manner. I loved working directly with customers, and helping solve their problems. Sometimes the job was very hectic during the holiday season. However, I enjoy the challenge of efficiently working in fast paced environments. I learned how important it is to provide excellent customer service, to ensure that customers return in the future. I got to know a lot of the regular customers, and got along great with management and coworkers. The managers were very accommodating to my schedule and they respected me as a human, not just another employee. A typical day at work was fun, and somewhere I enjoyed being."
good,"I haven't been employed at Weis for very long,so I feel a review at this time wouldn't be fair although I do enjoy my job and colleagues very much.It is a very fast paced job.I have always enjoyed working with people and this job allows me to meet and talk with a wide range of people."
good,collecting carts and maintaining the front-end  and taking the trash out I have learned to be on time the hardest part of the job is when u are done  with a job u don't know what to do next until u ether do something yourself or ask
good,"paid well, challenging, not much communication with other workers, mostly a solo job in the beer register. would recommend if you are looking for good money and not necessarily for a warm environment."
good,An 8 hour shift can vary depending on staffing. Management team does a wide variety of additional jobs. Team building is encouraged.I would say the hardest part of job is staffing during the daytime shifts. The most enjoyable is seeing and talking to regular customers.
good,"co workers was fun and kind, management had its own issues, and the guest were all very well in general attitudes. nice deals on products for its employees."
good,flexible place to work if looking for small add to income. gives opportunity for starting customer service position. Listen to customer needs and help with any problems. Oversee cashiers and their needs for help with customers.
good,"A driven grocer with intentions to be the neighborhood supermarket. This store is accepting of all, and treats everyone fairly."
good,Management is understanding of student schedules and is flexible when scheduling. Can return to job over breaks from college without any issues.
good,I enjoyed working at Weis. I left the company for more money and regret that decision everyday. They treat you fair and there are no games played. One of the best jobs I had.
good,"Performed great customer service skills helped customers with their shopping orders. I learned and was trained in most of the departments in the store such as cashier, customer service booth, lottery, produce dept, grocery dept, bakery dept, dairy dept, and deli dept. Co-workers were very energetic and friendly. Managers were easy to work with and easy to get along with. Hardest part when the rush came in and you try to please all the customers so they has a pleasant shopping experience. Enjoyable part was interacting with customers on a daily bases"
good,"at register checking out customer order, pointing out sale items that might have been missed.  I learned new touch screens and online shopping.  The management has been very open and welcoming and is willing to help if a problem arises.  Hardest part is during slow time and not have enough to do.  The best part is dealing with the customers, especially seniors and helping them."
good,"Best management team I have ever worked for. Family orientated while still keeping the company""s best interest first. Management definetly works with everyone on thier needs and in turn the store runs smoothly."
good,"There was a large variety of work in this job which made it enjoyable. Sometimes you would work in food service, with the slicer or in the back stocking items. Working overtime was prohibited, however, there was more than enough room to grow in the company. The most enjoyable part of working for this company was working in a team setting."
good,worked well with others and customers on daily basis. You have to learn to be patient. it was hard at first learning all the deli products. I enjoyed all my customers
good,Good people and managers to work with. Staff is friendly and welcoming and willing to help with any issues.
good,"I enjoy being a pharmacy technician for Weis Markets and feel that my supervisors have done their best to train me. Unfortunately, due to the restriction in my hours from low pay in combination with their limited hours open at night and on weekends, I haven't had much of a chance to train on things that are common in the work place any of the time of the week. It makes me feel uneasy about my performance, despite being a help when I am there."
good,"A typical day is running around work to keep customers happy. My managers are nice and fun to work with, really understanding. Coworkers like to work with me. The hardest part of my job is keeping everyone happy. The most enjoyable part is meeting interesting people all the time coming in."
good,"A typical day at work at weis markets would be fast past, hard working and fun. What I have learned from this company is how to be a leader and a assistant manager. The Hardest part of the Job would have to be the hours being cut and the most enjoyable part of the job would be the co-workers and how constant and fast past the job can be."
good,Weis took over for Giant markets about 9 yrs ago and has such done a very good job with both the customers and the employees. They also do good works within the community.
good,Great leadership within my department. Remote working allows for increased flexibility and independence in work schedule. I am evaluated on my output vs. hours working.
good,I enjoyed working in the deli. The coworkers were nice and the customers were a blast. It was a clean and safe environment to work. Management was really nice and helpful
good,Helped me grow comfortable communicating with customers and helped my teamwork and leadership skills. It helps me balance my School and work life in a time management position
good,"The people I worked with were great, the management was poor, the pay isn't that great, but is a good starting point for your first job. I enjoyed working there, I couldn't continue to work there the pay wasn't where I needed it to be."
good,"I was terminated from a large local employer after many years and applied at Weis for something to hold me over until a better opportunity came along.  4 years later, I have moved into a challenging and enjoyable roll.  I honestly love my job!!"
good,"Enjoy working there. The co-workers, customers we have there are very nice. Very well maintained store just wish it was busy constantly. Do not like waiting for customers to come to me. I try to wave them into my register area. I would prefer to have lines down the isle all the time to keep us busy all the time. Just my opinion."
good,"With the grocery store, on regular days it wouldn't be that busy, and we would be cleaning and organizing the registers and selves. On holidays it would be very busy! Long-time standing and short breaks."
good,the job is great for just starting out. i personally feel they should pay more so they can be competitive with other stores.  its very hard to live of the amount that you make.
good,"Weis Markets was a great job for me as I was going to college. They have very flexible hours and the management is pretty good, I never experienced any issues with anyone there."
good,I work every morning 7 days a week. I do like my job and what I do.I am always happy to see the regular customers..I get along with all of the workers & customers.I also got the chance to learn another dept. which I got to meet new people!
good,weis markets ws an alright employment oppurtunity and work experience apart from the fact that i was not paid the amount that I was initially promised or that I deserved for my job title.
good,"This job provided me with a lot of experience to further my career. I enjoyed the people I worked with, but felt that a lot of people in the pharmacy industry are unhappy with their career decision."
good,"It is a good place to work. It gets busy during certain times and you certainly have to be on your toes and ready to deal with it. Besides that, it’s a very nice place to work."
good,"Lots of collaborative employees"
good,"The day to day operations are based on the coworkers i work with.  if my co workers are slackers who have little to no passion for the job, the work day is rather draining.  But, when my fellow coworkers have pride in their work and try to do their best and work together, the job is much easier regardless of the customer traffic."
good,in general you worked on your own in the job that you were given and helped in other departments when necessary.  Hardest part was trying to get work done in the time given because of people calling off.
good,"A typical night (I worked 3rd shift) consisted of unloading trucks, separating them into their respective aisles, and then stocking merchandise. After all was stocked you would go around and pull items to the front of their shelves to give the imitation that the store was fully stocked. Management was friendly and easy to deal with, majority of the time. The hardest part of the job was during the holiday season. Your trucks were usually very large and you had to work at a fast, consistent pace to finish stocking all of your items in a given shift. The night crew was very enjoyable to work with and everyone was very friendly."
good,"Best job available around the CA area, flexible hours, good wages. Benefits to those who can hold down hours and their position. Upper management very friendly and agreeable but lower is often lacking/stressed. Always hiring cashiers, backroom and nightshift stocking."
good,"Good equipment, Newer trucks, Do your delivers and go home. My biggest compliant was starting at 130 am one day and 7 am the next. But its part of the job. I think over all weis does a great job at making sure you earn your money for the week."
good,No issues at all. Only leaving because im moving out of state. A typical day was pretty busy but not intolerable. Just enough to get you through your day quickly.
good,"I work/worked at store 113, department 98. It wasn’t always too busy, and the rules were set for us that we strictly had to follow no matter how busy we were or weren’t. Weis Corporate is very well observant and try the best they can to ensure that their associates dress correctly and remain professional on the job."
good,"Once you learn the culture, it is a good place to work. You need to be focused and driven to be happy with this company. This  company is always looking for people who want to grown and learn"
good,Everyone works well together. They work with your availability. Can be very fast paced. Opportunity for career growth if wanted. Good benefits. Overall is a good company to work for.
good,Weis was a fun always changing place to work.  Management needs to communicate better.  Hours rotate.  Employees do not seem very happy a lot due to not enough help
good,Weis is full of great people. There is excellent opportunity to advance within the company. I advanced 4 times in seven years with the company and look forward to more.
good,All of the co-workers were amazing. The company was not very well organized. Not much room for advancement or hours available. Great for a part time job but not recommended for full time positions.
good,"Fun and enjoyable work place, where every one gets a long and help each other out. Very diverse and and easy going work environment.  Great customer service and our customers are like our family."
good,Working at Weis Market is mostly a slow paced job. The coworkers are very nice and good to talk to. When it comes to the costumers they are extremely polite. I would gladly recommend my friends and family to work there. The reason for leaving is because I am looking for a job with more hours and high pay.
good,"You sometimes have to deal with nasty customers, but coworkers make the job worth it. Pay is pretty good for the job, but the position does not include any benefits."
good,"Weis was my first job while I was in high school back in 2006, everyone there made me feel welcomed and will trained.  I learned about the proper methods to stocking shelves as well using the FIFO method."
good,it was good and stuff i dont feel like wrting this but i mean come on why are you guys making me write this do you honestly expect me to go into through detail about a stupid college job
good,I enjoy working for this company. My needs have changed and I am looking for a full time day shift position. It seemed as though it was a lot to learn at first.
good,A typical day was a very fast pace with no breaks for restroom or lunch. I learned that I didn't want a position like this. Management was unresponsive to suggestions for improvement of our work space. The pharmacy staff members were all dedicated and pleasant. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a demanding clientele and solving dilemmas with the insurance companies. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with some oh the older patients.
good,It is a good work environment with good co-workers. Somewhat varied job responsibilities so the job isn't mundane. Understanding and flexible management
good,Fun and enjoyable job where I got to talk to a variety of different people and establish many long lasting relationships with fellow workers and customers.
good,I loved working at weis...my co- workers were just great..we did our jobs and had fun doing them. It was a great experience working for this company..would love to have that type of job again
good,"I check out customers out on the register, self-scan, and I monitor the front-end to make sure the customers get a quick and speedy checkout. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers. You have to be on your toes, think quickly, and act in a professional manner in order to get these people thru the line. What I learned in the past five years of working here, make sure you take of the customer no matter what to make them happy in order for them to return to.  Front Staff members are very friendly and are willing to help out."
good,"I liked the atmosphere of the store. I got to know and most of the other store associates pretty well. All of them were a joy and a pleasure to work for and with. "
good,"This job was a great opportunity to build my customer service skills, flexibility, and attend to customer needs. I not only rang up groceries, but helped manage the front end and stock shelves. It taught me flexibility and openness to new opportunities."
good,Weis markets is a friendly environment that seeks to train young and aspiring market employees. The store is quite large with many opportunities for advancement to a non-training store. I enjoyed working with other employees and management.
good,"The management came and went, with the location I was at, as it was a training location. Some managers were good, while others I tended to avoid. When I first started, the co-workers I had were mostly around my age, during the shifts I worked, and I went to school with some of them. The people I work with now vary in age, and I am no longer in school, and do not talk to them as much."
good,Every day basically the same its a very repetitive job. Co workers were great the management varies like every other place
good,I really enjoyed this job position while I was in community college.  I learned how to handle big transactions of money through customer service; and eventually learned how to balance the books as the book-keeper of the company.
good,"Advanced within 2 months. General employees were friendly managers were nice. would recommend dis advantage pay isnt great"
good,Weis Markets is a nice and clean place to work with many friendly and outgoing employees. Weis Markets is also equipped with many great managers throughout the chain.
good,"great management, fun work place, good employees, good hours, need more hours, and a little bit better pay would be nice and more full time opportunity."
good,"Fast-paced, nice customers, very cool co-workers. Management staff very professional, yet considerate. respectable."
good,Alot of pressure from upper management for goals but there is little direct involvement from them. A good company to make a career out of if you make friend with the right people.
good,"*Baking breads to donuts to pie and cakes to cookies"
good,The most important thing that I can say about this company is that they are fare on every level. Very flexible with hours and decent pay for working at a grocery store.
good,At the time I worked for Weis Market it was a family owned operation. I was able to progress from an entry level position to management.
good,Loved everybody I worked with. was my first job. Loved the customers.
good,"Good management"
good,"A typical day requires me to first make sure all my sale items are ready for the upcoming sales day. Once I am sure they are sufficient, I then begin stocking the freight from my truck for the day. Helping customers and making sure the items that are in demand that day are full are only a few things that involve a typical day. Throughout the 7 years I have been employed there I have learned many things. Managing a crew of workers, interaction with customers ensuring thier needs are met to my fullest, and controlling the inventory of our backroom balancing items needed on-hand that customers require and making sure the level does not spiral out of control. The hardest part of the job is also the most enjoyable. Everyday seems to have its own new challenges due to the changing needs of the customer. Because of this everyday is different and requires quick thinking and a certain level of prioritization to ensure the customer leaves happy."
good,"Weis is a great company,I enjoyed working their.Weis had great customer service and did their best to make their workers happy.All of the worker's have stupendous personalities."
good,"I wish they wouldn't be so concerned about labor cost. Like my job I stock the cold meats and frozen meats. I should be there on truck days to make sure the old stock and new stock is put on the shelf. We get a truck on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. I figured if I could get 28 to 30 hours a week the shelves would look better"
good,Good company to work for like the hours and that pay was ok I would have like to stay there but had to leave because I had some family issues and they would take me back
good,Good on scheduling and management. Work is there and good work is looked at. Payroll is efficient and on time. No big issues overall very professional.
good,Weis is a good company to work for during high school / college. They are flexible for your needs as a student. They rotate your jobs often to ensure you do not get bored.
good,I really need this job I need the money but I am still in high school so I can't work long hours. I would be really happy if I get this job. I have brothers who work their and I herd that they are really good at my other job I was not happy
good,"The camaraderie and teamwork make this a great place to work. If you are just starting in the workforce, or are looking for a new job,  this may work for you. Motivated individuals  can move up quickly  if they are interested in  this industry."
good,honestly this job was easy asf and it's not a bad job to work at. i worked deli and it wasn't as bad as it always sounds i had good and bad days so i'm not complaining.
good,"I loved my job. Great opportunities for advancement. I was part of 5-S training team for my region."

good,"I highly recommend Weis. They are flexible and there is always something to learn. There are many job opportunities available, from part time to full  time."
good,"Weis markets is a fun fast paced job to work at. Weis markets looks for employees who are engaged with there customers, workers who care about there job an title"
good,"Friendly working environment , ability to grow with the company, can be cross trained for other departments.They have an assessment for associates to go to so that they can move up & do other things in the company."
good,Weis Markets was a wonderful first job for me in High School. The people that work there are very nice people who go above and beyond to make their employees feel welcome.
good,While Studying at college I had a flexible enough schedule to get to my classes and work when off and doing holidays. While the work is not hard to learn There are little opportunities for job  investment
good,Weis operates as a team and is supportive of employees. They give breaks and often promote from within while giving opportunities for advancing within the company.
good,I enjoyed my job there and appreciated the way employees were treated.  The management was very respectful towards employees. I ended up looking for a better paying position when I left.
good,Very good place to work for. Advancements opportunities are available. Great training program. Team work environment. Good benefits. Competitive salary.
good,"worked as a deli associate, cutting and preparing meats and cheese"
good,"It has been some years since I have worked for Weis, overall calm place to work, pleasant atmosphere. Training was good, employees are very helpful. Not too competetive."
good,It is a fast paced environment depending on your position. Fellow employees are great to be around help with the work and are friendly. Management helped with any issue that arose and gave the hours that were requested The most enjoyable part are the customers many come in and make your day better.
good,I enjoyed working at Weis because they were relatively flexible with the hours which I was able to work.  The other employees made the job fun and the customers made it rewarding.  I would recommend as a first job.
good,"I handled all money and credit transactions, making sure the customer is satisfied, completing customer check outs and bagging groceries and voiding any needed transactions, operations a 10 key pad and computer."
good,Management always heard staff out. Pay was decent. Coworkers generally work well together and get along well. Breaks and lunches were given when due. Its a good job.
good,"good days, some customers were disrespectful but most of them you could let go and the employees were good workers and worked together. all the managers were fair except one. the store was clean which was a plus for the workers and customers"
good,When told by management you can go home to be with a dying loved one and then upon return you never hear back.  Lack of communication.  Loved Connie my boss
good,"Moving product from the warehouse and putting them on the shelves out in the store, management was ok most of the time and the hardest part was moving heavy products around."
good,"Enjoyed my job, the people and my manager. I waited on customers and helped out other departments when they needed me too. I was a team player. I helped out my manager, when no one else would. Good place and good people."
good,Company was alittle different than what I expected.  The company came and and right off the bat the training was nothing and they thought that everyone that worked there was overpaid.  Which of course we didnt agree about.
good,"Good management, great coworkers. Very constant. Helping people. Good place to work. Very fulfilling. Customers can be annoying. But overall a good place to be."
good,"Weis is a great starter job for teens. Management is respectful. Many teens goof around and are not properly reprimanded for their laziness. Customers are nice, co workers are respectful and kind. Busiest times are usually between 3pm and 6pm. Quite a lot of gossip goes on and it's not looked down upon. Flexible schedules."
good,"Job Work/Life Balance valuable"
good,"I worked at Weiss as Customer Courtesy Clerk which means I kept front of store looking nice. I would retrieve carts and baskets, sweep front of building, water plants, and perform any other duties asked of me. I would often replenish produce section."
good,I did not like that there was no room for growth or promotion. All of the managers are very nice and help you out in any way possible. The hardest part of the job is all of the cleaning.
good,"I stated working in the meat room cleaning the meat counter cutting boards saws meat grinder , then I would unload the trucks that came in for the store at night ,I would also stock the shelves with products  ,I would also work in the dairy department stocking the shelves ,and   the freezer  department"

good,"Work part time as Store Clerk. My job is to keep the front lobby, bathrooms and store clean. Also bring in shopping carts from the parking lot including motorized ones. Also have to help customers with their groceries packing and taking them out to their cars. What I have learned is to understand that the customers are the most vital part of our store and to treat them with respect and help them out to the upmost of my ability. The management is very kind and helpful, and try to help me with my job when they can or send out someone who is free to assist me. The workplace culture is hectic at times and the store does seem to have enough employees at certain busy times. The hardest part of my job is when I start a certain job and then I am called to do another one like cleaning up a spill especially if it is complicated. Another hard part of the job is that I don't seem to have enough hours to complete all the tasks I need to do, like if it is real busy all I can do is to bring the carts in and change the bottle machines when it is needed. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping out the customers with their needs and questions, and also working with a great group of people."
good,"A typical work day is just the customers coming in grocery shopping and me handling the needs of each guest, I learned how to improve my people skills so that way I can make sure each person is comfortable at the store."

good,"Giant Markets was a family run business that was sold to Weis Markets, after the sale the store lost some of its family run charm but gained a wider selection of merchandise and they kept on the staff."

good,"Weis Markets is a wonderful place to work for. If you are looking for a company that works flexibly with your home life, this is the place to work. I completed both my Associates and Bachelor degree while working for Weis Markets. I specifically worked for the Boonsboro location, and the members of management fully supported in my venture. But, just like any other company, there is a give-and-take. I worked hard and put forth extra effort to help the store out where it was needed and they adjusted to my scheduling needs as best they could. The hardest part of this job is that management holds high expectations for their employees; as they should. The most enjoyable part of this job is the people you get to know, co-workers and shoppers alike, and the friendships that you build from that."
good,"my typical day at Weis markets was good. what i learned was helping customers with loading groceries in their vehicles. the management is good and don't have any issues with them. the working conditions are good.the hardest part of the job is dealing with unhappy customers, but however trying to help them isn't too bad. "

good,"This was actually my first job I have ever gotten, but I got along well with my co-workers and management and made sure the company ran smoothly."
good,All jobs are learning experience but u never really forget your first real job. Of course many people have a temporary job that lasts a few months. Once u start making friends and get to know those people that u are with every day it gets u emotional. There are many things i didn't like about WEIS though as it is impossible to find a job that doesn't get on your nerves. if it came down to it though i would work there again.
good,The environment is very easy going. Customers are nice unless you do something wrong that they do no like. The shift goes by fast.
good,While I've learned a lot about grocery management and food safety I find that the company is beginning to focus more on expecting higher results with less resources. Well paid management is now put in the position to systematically reduce labor while maintaining or exceeding current results.

I learned how to have great customer service. My managers were nice people who treated everyone equally. All of my co-workers, we were more like a family. The worst part of the job was not working for enough hours, the best part of the job was being active throughout the day."
good,"The people are cool, very flexible schedule, definitely good for those skilled at multitasking, good hours, good pay, pretty cool place overall to work especially if this is your first job or you have limited work experience"
good,"Each day is different depending on the time of year. I have grown  as a manager and a leader through the variety of store locations, trainings and meetings. I work with a variety of managers to collaborate ideas for sales goals and shrink reduction; as well as, ways to improve employee moral, teamwork and efficiency. I have a phenomenal team in management and associates. We work together more and more as a team to improve efficiency and increase sales by taking on tasks in a variety of ways. The hardest part of my job is deterring bad habits to improve existing skills. However, by continually repairing bad habits, it has also shown me the most enjoyable part of my job; seeing people grow, improve and receive promotions to further their career under my training, is highly rewarding."
good,"I liked working at Weis Pharmacy Store 104, but after 15 years I wanted a change. I assembled a great working staff, that worked really great together for about 7 years, but needed some time off."

good,"A typical day at work consists of making large quantities of food while continuously cleaning and taking orders from customers. It is a lot to take on all at once, but once you get in the groove of things it is very enjoyable. The workers that I have come into contact with from this job were the best, I will be friends with them for many years."
good,"Weis Markets is a grocery store pharmacy. Each week I worked 3, 12 hour shifts and the staffing was great. The best part of the job was that the district manager was up-front, helpful and instructive. I was a floater and met a lot of coworkers, most were friendly and enjoyed their jobs. The hardest part of my job was that I traveled to extremes to make sure the stores had coverage. Overall terrific company."
good,Fast paced very busy. Always had something to do.Lots of customer relationships. Favorite part of the job had lots of regular customers daily and they were happy to know that we already knew what they wanted so they would get in and get out
good,Generally doing the same thing but can also move to different department. Work at a fast paced but also a slow paced depending on the day. Would recommended working at any Weis Markets

good,I really enjoyed working here. Some customers are less tolerable but great managment and co workers. LIKED WORKING HERE AND MISS MY CO WORKERS they were great

good,"very good advancement opportunities for hard working and motivated associates "
good,"Typical work day was working with employees and customers. Making decisions to better company needs. Writing orders to maintain the store. Helping customers with their needs and showing them where they can find things, assuring they leave the store Happy and satisfied. I have learned that making your customers happy at the end of their shopping trip always brings them back and the smile on their face is priceless,"
good,"People here are great, it's a small environment with friendly staff on a store and local level"
good,On a typical day of work I visit three store. While in a store i check up on the computer generated ordering system and fix any issues within the store. I also check in with the store management team to see if they or any associates need additional training on the system.  The biggest challenge with my job is trying to get an associate to under stand the system when they have never used a computer. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping people understand the system and helping them to be successful in there job.
good,I loved working at weis was a cashier and human resources. however they did not train me properly for my promotion. they did not believe their management staff over the people who had been there the longest. and rather then take over the role of fixing an issue they passed it down the line and handed it to someone else. I ended up with a lot of other peoples responsibilities. then threatened to be fired every time I could not finish all in a six hour shift.
good,"A typical day at work includes selecting orders on powered pallet jacks, wrapping the orders you've completed, and delivering the orders to specified doors on the dock. Load the orders co-workers have completed on to trailers. Unload incoming product trailers to dock and warehouse locations. Use a fork lift to put away the product and place product in specific locations. I learned how to use a forklift, load/unload trailers, and how to use a powered pallet jack. I also learned how to manage my time better. Management was alright. The direct supervisors were great. My co-workers were easy to get along with and helpful during each shift. The hardest part of the job was the hours, 10 hours with over time often and the shift time was 6 pm to 4:30 am. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with others that respect you as much as you respect them."
good,"Since this was my first job, it was a great start to the working life. I was taught a lot of things that I needed to know as far as customer service. At times it was rough dealing with the management. Most of the co-workers were welcoming and easy going. I enjoyed my experience at Weis."
good,Weis Markets was a great experience. Management was sympathetic and understanding. They give the hardest duties to those who deserve it. I was a lead and at the time I was 17. They give those who work hard the respect and benefits they deserve
good,"* As a cashier you clock in and go right to ringing guests out where as bagger you do a lot of thing including bagging, garbages, take backs, taking back damages, and cleaning bottle room."
good,Management is good. They listen to you and are flexible with your schedule. Co-workers are easy to work with and are willing to help when you need them.
good,I love working there because the people there are nice and you meet great customers. There is always something to look forward to. The hours you are scheduled for are flexible but the amount are basically consistent.
good,"The work pace varies. The managers are always rotating and they're all friendly. Nice place to begin customer service experience in. 90% of customers are nice and make the job enjoyable. Love/Hate relationship with job but, overall it's okay. A job is a job. If I found a better paying job I'd leave in a heartbeat."

good,Is a place phisycal work you keep busy all day long and keep me and good helathy time go faster walking movement all day. Driver you forklift o pallet jack more the job is a gymnasium I think.
good,Weis is a very friendly place to work. They treat everyone super nice and I love all staff and customers. The Problem is I feel with my experience   I am getting about 30% less pay than what I deserve. I have talked to human resources about this and they really only give me a minimal raise that doesn't mean much to me.Very fun atmosphere and I look forward to going to work everyday. I love to make all my customers happy and I most of them on a first name basis.
good,overall i believe that weis markets was a fairly decent job and a great job for a teenager like me the hours were fair the pay was above minimum wage and the environment wasn't hostile at all
good,"easy starting job for any one new to the workforce. depending on your position your day will be different, but never the same each day. gives and understanding of how a grocery store runs day to day"
good,I really liked working for Weis Markets.  It was a fun atmosphere with plenty of opportunity to grow and learn from experience. I managed for the bakery and I had a lot of fun with all of the different aspects of the job. Sometimes management was a little bit harsh but that's because they were under pressure to keep production up.
good,"My typical day includes delegation of jobs, other than the normal cashiering.  Might be going out to gather up shopping carts out of the parking lot, to cleaning a spill in one of the aisles.  I assist in loans and cash pickups.  I enjoy working here part time, but would really like to spend my evenings at home with my husband.  I love doing what I do.  I pull reports, count cash, assist cashiers either with an upset/irate customer or by replenishing their cash.  The hardest part of my job would have to be that I am away from my husband 4 nights each week.  The most enjoyable are the wonderful customers and employees."
good,"This company is pretty straightforward when you start: they tell you what you need to do, and help/teach you new tasks along the way. Its a pretty easy environment to work in, though depending on the day it can get hectic. The manager is very helpful during the work day, and the coworkers are easy to get along with."

good,I usually did multiple jobs in one work day! My management and co-workers were great to work with. I loved working with the customers.

good,"Was a great job to set up for a career. Was able to move quickly in positions, customers are the best part of the job.

Co workers were amazing, nice and friendly."

good,The reason I put an application in at weis markets was because I needed a job but I was also in college as well and my last job wasn't very good at working around my schedule so I decided to go to weis markets and there they really worked around my class schedule.

good,"Great work environment."
good,"I'm not too fond of the way everyone's positions keep changing, we keep getting new managers. Everyone is afraid of the general manager, he'd fire you over your hair color. He's more intimidating than friendly. Everyone gets along great and most of us are like one big happy family, we look out for each other. The hardest part of the job is seeking everyones needs but we do our my best. I believe the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to see all the friends I've made everyday and how I get to interact with people."
good,"Waited on customers, sliced meats and cheeses, prepared foods, cleaned work areas, stocked shelves, put away inventory, and ordered inventory. Opened and closed the deli it just depended on what hours you worked."

good,"This job gave me a natural outlet to display my personality as a very social person and to service customers comfortably. I never felt overwhelmed, it was a job that gave me a manager's edge. Creating an enjoyable experience for the customer always made me feel good about being at work. I began to know everyone in my county because of my presence at the service desk and eventually became good friends with a lot of them outside of work."
good,"I worked in the bakery and it was fun to decorate cakes, I am not sure what the rest of the store was like. The boss in the bakery never made you feel like you were doing enough. They tend to only hire part-time employees, so you are lucky if you are hired as full time."
good,Its a work place where everyone helps everyone else and everyone works together to get the job done. I loved working here and love the relationships I made with customers.
good,If hours were better it would've been a bomb job.Part time hours do not pay the bills.Its not something you really want to do long term either.Mostly entry level

good,If you ask you get things done you just have to speak up communication is always key and work as a team things are easier if you have help but if you know what your doing get things done without saying a word also getting things done without someone having to ask you is apparent so it’s a good thing to do it was a good experience
good,"I worked there during my extended vacation in Pennsylvania, all I can say is it was the hardest job I ever had to leave. Everyone became so close and were always helpful during stressful times. Everyone had each others backs."
good,A typical day is fast paced. You're always on your feet. The manager is very nice and respectful. Hardest part of the job is probably all the lack of employers. The most enjoyable part about the job is the working environment.
good,good supermarket to work at with lots of vegetables and meats for your enjoyment there is a good culture here and a lot to be enjoyed about this job for sure

good,I learned all the different fruits and vegetables within the business. Got to interact with customers and had a pretty easy workday overall.

good,"The best part about working at Weis Markets is the atmosphere. Between the workers, the managers and the customers there's always something going on and things to do. You're genuinely cared for, everyone is super nice and welcoming. There's room to learn and grow and move up in the business. If you're a quick learner no part of any job here is too difficult. The overall experience is wonderful."
good,co workers were disrespectful and management. stocking products third shift and deli during the day. customers were sometimes hard to deal with. had a lot of duties to do during your shift sometimes could not get all done
good,"A typical day would include standing at the register and greeting and talking to the people that come through the front end. You are expected to ring up the items and scan in coupons and things of that nature. You are taught how to use WIC and other government funded grocery programs. Working there has helped me expand upon my experience with Customer Service. The management team is exceptional and the co-workers are a joy to be around and work with.

good,This is a great place to be when your still looking for a full time job.
good,"A typical day is waiting on customers, and answering questions. I learn everyday that if you don't have customers you don't have a job. The hardest part of my job is standing in one spot all day. The most enjoyable thing about my job is the customers."

A typical day involves working the customer service desk and filling out the correct paperwork when customers need assistance and when it's time to close down the desk at the end of the night. It involves small and large transactions dealing with all forms of payment.

Although I was a part-time employee, it became evident to me that I had a heavy work load and limited hours to perform my tasks. The hardest part of this job was my inability to communicate my need for help in this position. Looking back, I learned that it's okay to ask for help as soon as I see the need.
