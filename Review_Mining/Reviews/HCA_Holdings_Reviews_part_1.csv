rating,review
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,HCA Healthcare was a great experience for me. I appreciate them giving me the opportunity to work for their company. My coworkers and Doctors were amazing and very professional.
bad,"Only the popular people excelled in HCA Corp business office. The culture was one of 'Mean Girls"" and upper management let them continue down this path."
bad,"Typical day at work - no structure, nobody knows what to do"
bad,The  company had a very high turnover w/ managers and employees. there wasn't room for growth in my tenure there and the only way I could advance was to resign and work for another company.
bad,"EFD  Recruiters live in fear of losing their jobs. No work life balance. Constant calls, texts and IM with threats from Director and Mostly Manager. Which current manager was removed from st. Lucie and Mercy hospital location for the same reason. And still is employed. The constant calls are finding ways why you did this wrong or why you did that wrong. No work life balance and you must meet your number because your job is threatened. Your never praised for the good job, People are medications because of the level of anxiety there is. We have lost few really great seasoned recruiters because of these punitive ways. Most probably lose some more if they are no stopped. So don't work here unless you want to make your self sick."
bad,Terrible place to work.  Manager poorly trained and plays favorites.  Her best friend works for her.  The doctors yell at the patients and throw their RX bottles in the trash.
bad,management was not very nice nor helpful when we needed help. the company overall was an okay company to work for. I will recommend it to others who need a job.
bad,"The hospital closing down soon so there isn’t many cases booked here . Very poor management, half the staff left because of the manger / superviser. Over worked because there isn’t enough people that work there . I was here for 2 years and I saw people come and go . "
bad,"worst management. worst co-workers. never worked with more manipulative, back stabbing, gossiping co-workers. made the job unbearable on a daily basis. good bye."
bad,"HCA is a company that only cares about the bottom line. Management plays favorites as does HR.  They put people in charge that are vindictive and can't seam to take care of their own personal life. They take their miserable attitude out on their employees."
bad,"Poor management , poor wages. High turnover rates. Very few opportunities for career advancement. The pay is not competitive compared to other hospitals."
bad,"When you see the list of tasks and responsibilities assigned to the job, you can quickly see how it would be a full-time, 365 days per year Poor salary"
bad,I felt over worked and under appreciated. The management structure never focused on the day to day needs of the work force. The corporate structure doesn't represent cultural diversity.
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of gossiping more then production,  Favortism over performance, when you do not fit in the click then you are in constant fear of losing your job.  It is the equal to a high school bullying situation. These are suppose to be professional, working in a field that is to help people."
bad,They had unrealistic goals for their employees. Management bullied their employees and over worked them. There contract with the insurance companies were never update. Ceo was an egomaniac.
bad,Very poor company to work for. Would not recommend this company to anyone. They do not care about employees that work for them.  The pay is less than the normal.
bad,"Conditions were awful.  Staff was cold, hostile, aggressive and management couldn't be bothered to intervene in a professional manner.  "
bad,"Everything I have ever heard about HCA is true. They're all about the money. The radiology department is a club house and if you aren't in then you aren't going anywhere. It's not about hard work, diligence, or even common sense, it's a popularity contest. They don't give raises and they don't increase benefits. All for them and none for you. I wish I had never come to work here."
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,"the hardest part of the job was the lead nurse, hostile and power trip  Learned about children's triage.  director was excellent.  most enjoyable part of the job was triage,"
bad,"It was alarming at first regarding the high turnover.  Employees would go to lunch and wouldn't return.  The amount of work that was expected to be put out was unbelievable, there was so much work you wouldn't have time to go to the rest room. And very under paid."
bad,"They closed several locations; therefore , I lost faith in this company after working with the organization for over 6 years."
bad,"It is in my experience that the lack of training will be your downfall.  The manager that is tasked with obtaining new talent also is the person who is in charge of training new talent.  "
bad,"This place is a disaster. Not a great place to be long term. Although some of the co-workers are okay, others will stab you in the back over absolute jealousy."
bad,"I worked here and did an amazing job for 7 months in a position which needed a certification. They gave me a 10 cent raise after I passed my boards and acted like they were doing me a favor."
bad,"Understaffed, dangerous working conditions. Complete chaos. Patients are not treated well. Staff is treated worse. Needs to be condemned."
bad,"they will not pay"
bad,"This job gave me a lot of experience, but no chances for for advancement. The benfits are not competetive benefits or salary."
bad,"Very stressful production driven company.  Management not easily approachable, often feels challenged if you're questioning them."
bad,"Will not work for an HCA company again.  "
bad,Would never work here again. Left on good terms and the good news was I left. The manager made up her own rules. Like having to sign a clip board to go to break room to get ice for my water. If you forgot then you were threatened to be written up.
bad,"I was text every evening when to come in the next day. Some days no work, other days 12+ hours. No breaks offered on the long stressful days. Horrible work life balance because you never knew when you went into work or when you would finish work so forget any evening plans outside of work.  I quit when I was expected to run an outdated, fluoroscopy, full sized C-arm with control panel for which I received zero training. The surgery center wanted to start doing urology cases but didn't want to hire a Radiology Tech."
bad,One clinic in particular was a disgrace to healthcare. The poor doctors deserve much better than the staff they receive. The staff are incompetent but are allowed to run the show.
bad,"This company does not employ good people - management are weak and do not act as good leaders, arrogant and have OCD. Left this job after a few days thankfully . Can see the cfo is still struggling to find a replacement as he had already been through 8 PAs. This should be a HR issue and it’s surprising it’s allowed to continue. "
bad,"You will only survive this culture if you throw hard working people under the bus to move up in your personal career path.  Some of the most awful, unethical people I have ever encountered.  Be warned."
bad,"Firstly having worked in a diverse set of job roles, the salary poorly reflects the workload."
bad,"Been working for HCA Medical City Mckinney.  Horrible horrible manager and director in Admitting dept. "
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,this was not a great work environment. was very stressful. was in the call center. even going to the bathroom seemed to be a problem. poor management and bad attitudes
bad,At lot of favoritism made it a hostile environment!  Didn't Always treat the MAs with respect more so as demeaning!  I want another job that care about the employees
bad,"Many,many layers of out of touch and out of practice ""leadership""- with no regard to staff caregivers  or their patients, who are putting their lives and safety in the hands of this Corporation. Leaders at this Corporation are not of high quality which leads to even worse quality beneath them. This is a terrifying  fact for unknowing people coming to this corporation for healthcare!!! They  preach one thing and practice the opposite.  As a  healthcare provider, I am mainly urging patients to understand this business which is not looking out for your best interest and safety!! Buyer beware , your life could depend on it!!"
bad,"Its a horrible company not professional at all, the managers do not care about employers and they do not care about health of employers in Fort Myers FL location."
bad,"Experience is purely based on role and location. Pros and cons amongst clinic and non clinical areas. Can be a toxic place to work, full of discrimination and humiliation, especially amongst new and junior employees. Senior management do not appreciate contributions. You are expected to work until you have nothing left to give, while breaks are frowned upon. Working within the finance department amongst the largest hospitals of the group, have bad reputations, leadership and overal morale. Your rights, employment policies are used against you, to suit business needs. Retention is HCA’s biggest downfall. Staff leaving every other day, adds workload to multiply at no extra incentive, time back or pay. No such thing as formal training. Good pay, however very unequal amongst co-workers. Social events are well. You meet great people. However things needs addressing and sought change."
bad,"unethical practices, lack of soft skills provided to management, transparency not practiced, collaboration used as entitlement for unprofessional behavior,"
bad,Took job over seas so they could pay employees less. Management lied to employees for almost a year when asked about changes. Went through the motions of pretending to listen. Avoid this place.
bad,"Day-to-day hospital activities are driven by head office and from this ivory tower (which ultimately extends all the way to the USA) comes an extreme focus on profits (mostly cost cutting). So the best staff are leaving for more progressive hospitals in London and staff morale is suffering as well as patient care. "
bad,"Management is terrible and won't listen, low pay, and benefits are terrible, you have to use your PTO for all holidays. No room for advancement, The only good thing was my co-workers."
bad,This is a culture where blame and fear guide decisions stall levels of the organization. People are not given feedback for development but attacked publicly
bad,"Management have no idea what they are doing, they cause more stress to the job."
bad,"Classic cases of employing Head of departments that have no clue what they're doing, So many changes have mad it impossible to work here,constantly short staffed which means having to do two people's jobs but never increasing you pay, not a nice place to work!"
bad,This is a dangerous company to work for !!! They have absolutely no respect for their nursig staff whatsoever!!! This company only cares about the profits they make !! The turnover is pretty bad !! The acuity for the nurses is very unsafe!!!
bad,"•	Material Handler"
bad,"poor managers with no management professional experience on how to communicat, manage, nor raise their team up.....doing the least they can."
bad,"The organization is simply too big to have your voice heard, however  on the flip side there are plenty of resources. A typical day is spent working through the system and trying to meet the corporate standards. I certainly did not feel as though the corporation cared for their employees or quality of health care, but more for the number of practice / hospital acquisitions."
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,"poorly managed to the point I would hate to be a patient. poor work culture, employees unsupported- competitive nature- looking for someone to blame... sad -- worked extremley hard, was never good enough. Mean folks where I worked. hope it has changed..."
bad,"My experience working here was horrible.  Upper management was horrible.  There was a revolving door on employees from all level.  It was a hostile work environment.  No one got along and most of all it was praised when you caused drama! AP was not allowed to talk to AR.  I, as the manager, could not do anything about it because the AR manager made the rules and had been there longer than me.  It was just plain crazy!"
bad,"The Manager lie to you in the interview he doesn't told you that you have to do 55 picks per hour, you have to move fast or he would write in your productivity paper the is GOING TO TAKE DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS AGAINTS YOU."
bad,Management thought more about management then they did for regular employees.
bad,"The Customer Service division is a nightmare. Management is inexperienced and lack moral ethics. The pay is fair, but work conditions and management negatively out weigh the pay rate. The company is a call center for Healthgrades which uses unfair and unethical practices to dupe the public into getting pay for unwarrented Physician referrals. Although this company is making money hand over fist by duping the public and the Physicians they represent, any yearly pay increases were very meager and unfair."
bad,"The company itself is not so bad but senior managers are seriously lacking in managerial skills. Instead of fostering supportive environment where employees can thrive, there is a serious culture of undermining and bullying going on. Staff retention is a big problem due to these issues. Anyone hoping to apply for a job with this company, please reconsider or you'll make the worst mistake of your career."
bad,Micromanaging by supervisors who have never done your job. Open retaliation when you report wrong doing. Rules only apply for some employees.  Good pa
bad,Great company but real bad management. There is no training or leadership. Skills and achievements are not recognised or rewarded. None is held accountable for their responsibilities
bad,The pay is low and management would rather hire outside the company rather than spend time to develop loyal internal candidates. There is a lot of finger pointing in the office with department to department and not unity in the workplace. The pay is low so be prepared to work just for the benefits or have a second job to subsidize income. It works best if there is a dual income in the house. Be prepared for no room for advancement so staying put for 5  + years.   None of the workers are really happy and management ignores this aspect.
bad,Very political and based on who likes you rather than your work. Very good  ol boy culture. Its more of a friends and family plan culture to fit in.  If not you are ousted
bad,"The people who work there are great, great attitudes, everyone gets along. Management on the other hand is a joke. The lack leadership skills. Managers have favorite employees put them on a pedastal, but disrespect the others. When we have meeting and they want “suggestions” they’ll shut you up and embarrass you in front of the department. No growthbas far as moving up, unless you kiss butt otherwise you’ll be at the same position till you quit or get worn out."
bad,"Resistant to progression. The phrase; ""We've always done it that way"", shouldn't have a place in modern business but sadly prevalent."
bad,"Lack of communication, unethical and unfair treatment of employees, hostile and harassing towards senior staff, breach of employee confidentiality...the list continues with complete disregard to how this effects the staff all the way down to the customer. To be a profit generated corporation, one would expect a better treatment of staff to improve and increase utilization."
bad,This place has been by far the worse employment I have ever experienced. The staff turnover rate is way over 50%. Managers are only worried about numbers and surveys. Management has a big turnover rate as well. Pay is insulting and you work your behind off. Complaints to upper management never responds to you....i would not recommend HCA for employment.
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,"Toxic culture! Management sucks!  Very unorganized  environment, communication is sent via email, if you’re off for a few days you feel out of the loop. Management is terrible and un-trust worthy."
bad,"No management support, no team work  and no career advancement/training  opportunities for."
bad,After many years working at HCA I was at my cap pay. The Manager talked down to me and the staff and was not HIPPA compliant. As she said we will sweep it under the rug and no one will know about it but I did and I  completely disagree with that type of work ethic.
bad,"The company is political. They hire and promote who they want if you kiss their butts. Employees are sooo underpaid and to cover up for this they try to throw in benefits and talk down about other companies but yet every January and/or early February the O's(CEO, COO, managers and directors) receive huge lavish bonuses anywhere from $5000-$20,000+ every year. Meanwhile they work you like slaves because all they care about are numbers and not quality! Production is set too high. This company have been paying out a lousy $300 bonus for the last 20 years and there are no cost of living increases. You have upper managenent receiving bonuses more than what some of employees make in a year. Ridiculous!!  There are no company Christmas parties, no paid holidays as they make you use your PTO for Holidays.  Slave house. Raises are pathetic-they give $0.15 -$0.30 raises, 401k sucks! You have to stay there a year now just to get your 401k match-this is how they stream you along. Employees have been there for 5 and 6 + years and still haven't had a dollar raise."
bad,"I received none of the materials I was supposed to after being hired, my ""shadowing"" lasted only two days, I witnessed several employees violate not only patient safety but jor requirements, and I was ""admonished"" for relating to patients to make them feel more at ease as admitted to the hospital as a patient, When I went to HR to bring my concerns to their attention I was severely admonished by the lab manager and was not treated respectfully, professionally, or fairly. A truly horrible work experience for breaking into the medical field as a better opportunity to better provide for my family."
bad,New senior leadership getting pushing out seasoned employees leaving a company of new and non-trained employees trying to run the company.  Turnover is now too high.
bad,"Poorly managed, voted most ethical company by some organization, they should actually go there. They are one of the most un-ethical corporations I have worked for."
bad,"While working for HCA, the culture at the hospital was everyone never knew if they were going to have a job from one day to the next. Administration treated Directors and Managers poorly and would terminate those employees when Administration created the roadblocks or would not authorize the appropriate funding to execute facility needs."
bad,play the game of management or you are at a dead end. Crooked company that care  nothing about its employees only making money. Opportunities within this organization are scarce.
bad,"At first it was a nice place to work but after we got a new director everything changed for the worse. They don’t care about their employees. It almost seems like the managers are making excuses to fire people just so they can hire new people that they like. The PTO is trash!! You get 6.15 hours every pay period but it has to be used for literally EVERYTHING. If you’re sick, have a doctors appointment, vacation, death in the family, pick up your kids. Also if there is a holiday that lands on a weekday you have to use your PTO to get paid for the day otherwise you lose time on your check and if you don’t have a full 40 hours on a paycheck they don’t give you all of your 6 hours. You can’t get out of your chair for anything even though the supervisors all sit around and chit chat all day. They reel you in with the 13.31 that honestly can’t even support a household. Also there is a ridiculous point system for attendance. Being late is a half point and calling I sick is a whole point. 7 points is termination and your points roll off a year after you get them. You’re not allowed to take off if you don’t have PTO so try not to get sick or have any family emergencies. Me and a co worker got into an accident and had to skip going to the ER for fear of getting a point."
bad,"The physicians are great to work with, they truly care for the patients. "
bad,there was very little growth potential while at HCA. Company did however provide good mentoring and support throughout. I found this to be very of average work environment. Salaries not determined by individual productivity but by overal market conditions.
bad,"Sunrise Hospital needs to look into their management in the ICU area. Once that problem is resolved, more RN, BSN’s that I know will apply there. We have a small medical community here and people are not wanting to apply because they do not liking with the current unit manager."
bad,"A typical day would include tree and snow removal, planting flowers, bushes, trees, as well as keeping up with the maintenance. I enjoyed taking pride in my work. Hot/cold temperatures was the hardest part."
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,"Very strict rules and regulation about everything. One minute late and you're considered tardy and mgmt don't mind to write you up for anything they feel fit. Management does a horrible job of communicating to their staff and departments, or even with each other for that matter. Problems, concerns are always met with ""yeah, we're working on that"" but nothing is ever done. Don't expect praise for your work, only criticism for every mistake you make. Money is good if you want to deal with  a lot of bull*****. Benefits have gone down tremendously since I started there 5 years ago. Most people that work there hate it and it shows with poor work ethic and a bad attitude. Expect to always be picking up someone else's slack. CYA or it WILL come back to bite you on everything you do. Also don't expect to get promoted unless you know someone or have connections, which is probably why so many unqualified people are in management positions."
bad,"Management would always tell staff, who are licensed clinitians and doctor, that patients always came first. Never true. The push to move patients rapidly or exclude them from psychiatric services based on criteria was forced."
bad,"Over the 10+ years I've worked at HCA in various IT&S positions in the southeast divisions, the company went through some significant changes.  Projects became much more 'cookie-cutter', defined by corporate, and left little wiggle room for common sense.  They are entering the late stages of what I would call the ""virtual savings"" period of Lean, meaning the pressure to meet the corporate demand for more efficiency and savings starts having the opposing effect.  The pendulum has clearly swung the other way now as supervisors and managers alike are struggling to make up new ways of how they ""saved"" money for the company in a last-ditch effort to promote themselves.  This has lead to a worsening culture (as long-term Lean initiatives always do) which shows little signs of repairing itself until management changes.  Once investors start seeing X amount of savings made this year, it is next to impossible to turn those expectations back to a realistic level."
bad,Harley street clinic is full of good and bad people . Good people work and they are not Allowed to say anything and those bad ones MAnagment arand are full of no sense talk connected in Hr even you want to copying you will end up loosing your job my advice stay away from HCA international also cleaning standards are very very poor
bad,Was not a good fit for me. Values weren’t in sync. HCA more concerned with accreditation than ethics. With big salaries and endless perks come unpleasant expectations
bad,"I made the huge mistake of signing a contract with HCA. It was the worst decision ever "
bad,"This position is not worth it, the company is merging with other divisions and the work load is outrageous. The company's mission statement is false. the clients that call in from the hospital on a daily basis either call about irrelevant issues and or anything that is completely out of our control. management is very bad and do not listen or value your opinion. the pay starts around $17 hour and you'll be bringing home about $1000 biweekly, if you don't have benefits, but it is not worth it. When you come into the organization as a Service desk analyst, you are already devalued. There is not really any promotion or growth. The support teams that you work with do not do their jobs accordingly and management will not really care, you will get blamed for issues out of your control. Do not apply! Do not waste your time!. you can start better somewhere else! and get paid what your are worth!."
bad,"During the interview there was arguments between schedulers and office staff. Schedulers were struggling with their job and gossiping in front of caregivers and newhires. There wasnt much training help for the HCA certificate the process was rather difficult and delayed very poor software and internet. "
bad,This was a great place to get exposure to the accounting industry.
bad,HCA is hard driven with no respect for the workers.  They are all about the money and statistics and want numbers increased while taking advantage of the employees.
bad,"-Micromanaged"
bad,"Management is very poor. There was no communication and unless you were in the right click, you were frowned upon no matter how hard you worked. It was all about money and not about the patients."
bad,Don't waste your time.  And for a healthcare giant the medical industry benefits are not that good.  One would expect better benefits from a healthcare giant.  Just make sure you do your home work before accepting a job there.
bad,They pay their medical assistants around $13/hour and even if you advance to management it’s only $17/hour. Not competitive pay for sure. They do not give many raises and treat you as if your just another number. Not a pleasant place to work.
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,THis is the absolute pits of a company for CNA's!   YOU CAN DO BETTER!!! MUCH MUCH BETTER!    THe staff is always short and they pile in the patients.    Nights are a HOLY Mess unsafe work environment!
bad,quality of staff hired has gone down  a lot of staff turnover.  new faces all the time with very few friendly faces that remain there long.  have hire people that other places have rejected several times.  Just a warm body to feel a slot.
bad,Scary hospital with very old equipment.  Much thought is given to remodeling and not touching certain walls to not have to bring care up to today's standards.  I worried that I could be admitted some day.
bad,"the management is the worst they only want to make them selves "
bad,They have no staff at HCA you have six patients and no aid it's happened to me many times that was very unsafe and very poor care for the patients they need to hire more CNAs pay more money to them primary nursing is no way to take care of six patients and the management doesn't know what they're doing
bad,"HCA - Work Environment Highly understand staff; other than that you have job security. This has change recently with the change of upper business management. "
bad,"Advancement is biased. Mostly based on favoritism not work skills."
bad,"I did not appreciate the management I found at HCA. They do not have a true fair system. There's is a system of fair on appearance, but lacks real due process, or a system they fully understand."
bad,I have been working here over ten years. Seem management and upper management are more concern about numbers now and less about the employees who bring in those numbers. They will work you till the end. It's NEVER enough. Sad to say EVERY department is experiencing some type of work overload.
bad,"Horrible experience, left Jaded, was accused of something with no evidence to back it. I would not suggest to anyone to work for them in this life time or the next."
bad,"This company did not treat their employees very well. The department I was in, the manager was HORRIBLE. You were in her office EVERY DAY for the TINIEST mistake. Very fake people that work there too!!"
bad,"Poor management, poor opportunity for advancement despite proven growth and productivity achievements. Misleading of job description not fully disclosed in interview, such as 100% allocated to phones."
bad,"Tough job, low pay, no benefits, and though the supervisor is fair, he is often harsh, and I am bone tired of being a whipping boy. I have never received the $15 per hour as advertised here on Indeed for this job. The supervisor has given me time off a couple of times for family needs, however he grumbles and pretends it can't be done each time. I need to deal with a family situation again in October 2019 and he's iffy at even allowing me the time off, Just 8 working days is all I am asking. I may have to quit to get my family needs taken care of. And I just found out today, 10/18/19, via the Indeed site, that my job is up for grabs.  Obviously the supervisor is planning to fire me."
bad,"toxic work environment, little mgt support"
bad,Management is rude and not understanding of basic human life. Rules suck. Pay sucks. It’s not that bad if you need something to hold you over. But wouldn’t plan to stay here too long. Our location went through 3 managers in 3 years...what does that tell you?
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,I feel like management here is lacks in how employees are treated and yet they feel that we should be grateful to have a job here. I have been here a while and feel over worked and very under appreciated.
bad,"Management is no good, they have a very bad turn over, people just don't stay, I spent a hard 3 years there, because I had no choice, but this time I'm out."
bad,working on the helpdesk is a nightmare.  calls back to back.  pressure to resolve issue on first call AND under 4 and a half minutes.   every minute you are there counts against you or for you.  lunch breaks are 30 minutes.  not near enough time to decompress and get ready for the second half of the day.  If you are good at the job  you will NEVER be promoted out of HelpDesk.  it is a trainwreck.
bad,A for profit organization that runs hospitals all over the country with one goal: Gain profits with as minimal staff as possible. patient care suffers
bad,Workplace was very stressful and management were hard to please.  Changed the rules at the drop of a hat with patient accounts and employee relations.
bad,"The management within HCA is horrible. They have a double standard and the pay is HORRIBLE. The vision for the corporation is great, but it lacks due poor management. You work a 12 hour shift and only get a half hour break. Many shifts are worked short staffed which means you don't always get a lunch break if you're busy. The insurance is high and it doesn't cover much. For a family of 4 I pay almost $400 a pay period."
bad,"What I was told during the interview compared to how how they actually ran the place was total opposite. No work life balance. Yes, they have PTO you can take off with. However, the attendance policy is a joke. If you or your children get very ill, expect to be at work sick. You could be throwing up and still have to sit there in the office for 8 hours. If you do go home, you get an occurrence."
bad,Management lacked proper training and professionalism. Employee feedback was seldom asked for and never taken into account. Frequent changes to policy and procedure led to constant confusion amongst employees.
bad,"The HR Operations Center is a good place to get your start in Human Resources. It is hard to transfer to different departments with limited opportunities to grow your career in Nashville. Turn over rates are high, and it's difficult to request time off."
bad,"Was not there long enough to give a solid feedback to HCA. Looking back, the center was small, and there wasn't enough staff to balance work and home life. I believe that matters."
bad,"I have worked here for 1 year. During that time, I have observed  restructure / reorganization. Colleagues are availed to work from home. I am not availed to work from home. I find management (DIV) does not back up what they tell you well and / or contradicts what they tell you as well as management is punitive, pushy .. "
bad,There is no advancement in this position;  the leadership is mediocre at best.  it is a stable job for people who don't wish to grow.  The teamwork is minimal.
bad,Think before accepting a position in this organization. Other states may be better. Management is often clique driven and does not like questions or new ideas.
bad,"I generally enjoyed working there but after 17 years of hard work and dedication I was laid off. Other than that I loved working there, but towards the end, was extremely stressful and they wanted to cut jobs."
bad,"I've been in my current job role for about 13 months and in that time the expectations put on the team has increased dramatically with no raise in pay to justify the workload.  I enjoy the team and the work I do but the pay really does not reflect what the company expects of us all."
bad,"Could be a great place to work if management would address issues, not sweep them under a rug. Very toxic environment , work should be a safe place but this is not."
bad,you  feel very  over work and  under paid. Being told  to  work a complete different  job  role on top of your current role w/o pay  compensation
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,I worked here only a month. Looked like a nice place to work . The work was e-z 
bad,"none, no comment on working at this corporation"
bad,"Do as you are told or you risk losing your job. Tell management what they like to hear, dear to be honest and realistic and you'll be seen as a threat"
bad,I have most enjoyed gaining the experience of working in private healthcare and I would recommend it to my friends or colleagues.  It's a very large facility catering for a wide variety of patients from International backgrounds also.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with patients who have language barriers.  A typical day at work involves a lot of meeting and greeting and hours spent on the computer inputting  and updating data onto the system.
bad,"Out of date values.Cliques and dogwhistle prejudices.  Before I started working there,I was warned by previous employees about the culture of bullying and lack of managerial support. Attractive salary and benefits enticed me.Had a terrible experience.I resigned a week before my probationary period ended.People only spoke to me once the Consultants spoke to me.In my first 3 weeks there I was invisible until one of the Consultants asked where I worked before and learnt my previous Consultants trained with or under them. "
bad,"Poor Senior Leadership, no respect for junior employees, middle managers were placed under high stress and worked long hours. "
bad,I learned a lot. I was very loyal to the company but did not feel that they were the same with me. Even though we cut the month end close days and has an outstanding Audit there was a lack of promotion and growth opportunity.
bad,Too many politics. HCA no longer cares about the patient's or the employee's. It's all about profit now. No loyalty what-so ever. The company use to be a good one but changes at the top has turned the company into an uncaring business that is only concerned in profit.
bad,Difficult to get involved in committees and process improvement. Not compensated based on performance. Lack of accountability and negative work environment.
bad,"My experience at HCA was not a great one.  The month end lasted about 2 weeks and the hours worked were extremely long.  Was in the office from 8 to 8 (even later) during the month end process.  As result, of the hours that was worked I chose to leave the company."
bad,When I started center manager was very difficult ver old school. New management came in and improved things some. OR director was very fair good to work with. OR side very well run.
bad,This company cared more about the numbers and bottom line and I understand that is important to a corporation. But they did not value their employees especially the ones of us that had been there for an extended period of time. It got to the point where they were getting rid of the long time employees and the more well paid employees and making it very difficult for them to stay. They changed our hours and duties out of the blue just to make it difficult for us to stay. They were hiring kids in high school or right out of high school who in no way had the quality work that we did. We had to fix all their mistakes and got no recognition for taking up the slack.
bad,"Short staffed "
bad,"If you are a white man, a good ole boy, GO FOR IT!"
bad,"Worked over a year with company and transferred into a new position towards the latter part of my time there.  Did not receive adequate training during probationary period, and asked for help several times without  concerns being addressed. Was pregnant at the time, in the new position and was conveniently relieved of duties after putting in requested time earned for maternity. No consideration was  taken of my situation at the time and did not receive the maternity time I've earned. Managers and department leads do not communicate well with staff or address issues well. Morale was low in both departments I worked in...coworkers  were great, but were uncomfortable speaking with management about concerns."
bad,"I rather maintain neutral for now. I have no reviews for now.  I have been working at HCA for 13 years and I have not been given the opportunity for advancement. "
bad,"I enjoy being a nurse and helping people.  It's a great feeling to leave work and know that you've helped someone. Everyone has a different story to tell you and you never know what is going to walk through the door,  so it's also exciting at times"
bad,"no help from management"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,Fun people to work with The management in that office was unprofessional sady and very underhanded on things that dealt with your job. Nothing was confidential.
bad,They really need to get things together. Not enough providers and not enough staff. Very angry patients daily. On-boarding needs lots of work. I feel that the company needs work as a corporation and as a clinic.
bad,"Poor company but interesting work"
bad,"prefer younger workers"
bad,"Serving humanity to honor God is no longer the mission."
bad,"Poor management"
bad,First impression was deceiving. The the management of the ASC division was poorly ran inducing stressful work culture and climate overall. Certain Surgery center Directors were cut-throat and unbearable. Their tenure in the position was excuse for not providing corrective leadership actions that would have matched the HCA overall organization mission.
bad,"I have learned to work more as a team and to not be afraid to ask for help. This was hard after working alone on weekends for 3 years.  A typical day is spent in the emergency department x-ray room and in surgery.  It is very fast paced, and can be stressful at times."
bad,Personal feelings get in the way of productivity. Everything felt like it was about who likes you as opposed to what you bring to the table.
bad,I struggled trying to meet all the job responsibilities.  I was not successful here and felt that they need to provide more support to the infection preservationists.  I met some very dedicated and professional individuals who were happy here.  Just not a good fit.
bad,"Poor management, no support from higher management. HR is non existent. Quarter cent raise per year for everyone regardless of performance. There's nothing American about HCA when coding jobs have been sent over seas. So sad."
bad,"I seemed to be the only outside hire who was not my manager's best friend, and shortly after starting the job, it became apparent that I probably would not last very long in my position. She played favorites with everyone except myself and her friends could do no wrong and I could do no right. Due to health concerns in my family, I was able to escape the horror of this position. The most enjoyable part of the job was quitting."
bad,"Staffing problems, no CNA or techs on floor, charge nurse taking full patient loads, take 5-6 patients that are full needs bed bound with no help on floors to keep patients and staff safe"
bad,Male dominated hierarchical management grid.  Females just go a lo OMG with males in position of power.Don't change the horizontal management framework as thinking outside the box not encouraged. k
bad,"I worked as a PRN Lab Technician Assistant (fancy phrase for a phlebotomist) and I had the most stressful nearly two years of my life there. We have several people on our PRN roster that never worked, so all of the shift needs were thrust on me. Of course, it's my fault I said yes as often as I did, but it was still ridiculous. The most insulting thing is that it took over a year for me to make even close to competitive wages (yet still low) because it was my first Phlebotomy job. I made $12.25 per hour with absolutely no benefits besides a useless 401K (not helpful for PRN...). When I did get my raise (which I had to email SEVERAL people before it was acknowledged that I was told I'd get a raise) I only went up to $14.75/hr. Shift differentials were insulting! The workload was unnecessarily excessive. You'd have to draw the entire hospital, answer the Emergency Room anytime they needed as well as the ICU. They expect a lot out of you, but do not compensate you for doing it."
bad,During my time there I loved my coworkers. We managed Oncology patients that became like family to us. Our physicians were fun to work with and the atmosphere was somewhat relaxed. Senior management however seemed out of touch with the floor nursing staff. We rarely saw anyone from senior management level. Our Nurse Manager had to spend quite a bit of time in meetings.
bad,"Company used to value it's employees and their opinions. Long gone are those days, and it is now a cut-throat, don't challenge mentality, which goes completely against the mission statement of the company I valued working at for over 20 years."
bad,"'For Profit' and 'Hospitals' are contradictory words.  Little Advancement,  Benefits get worse every year, I have to work 10-12 hours, daily to complete tasks.  Work Force is too small."
bad,It is very busy and always understaffed. You are stretched so thin that mistakes are inevitable. Coworkers are awesome but good people leave because of the work load. It seems to be getting worse and worse and the raises are a joke.
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,Great team work from the unit but poor staffing on a daily basis and constantly getting floated to other units. Management is not very supportive of their staff.
bad,you had people that would go on break and drink or do drugs and then come back in to work.  The supv.  finally caught on to three of them.  Make sure you know the position before you say yes.
bad,"No one appreciates you, it is terrible to not hear good things about your performance it is always what you dont do good enough! They just keep expecting expecting"
bad,Intense fast paced work place where many different departments have trouble communicatin with each other causing inefficiency and confusion.  They are many great employees but much of the management (not all) are out of touch with what realy is happening with their teams.
bad,"A typical day is very fast paced with numerous calls from patients regarding their accounts.  I've learned some of the medical and billing process, along with a minimum concept of the coding process involoving UB04s and UB92s.  In my experience, there have been people in management that were fair and honorable and there have been some that weren't. Overall management could have been better.  I enjoy working as a team and I consider my previous co-workers to be that much more.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to fully help the patients in a way that I'm use to due to the quantity call demand that was consistantly required of myself and other employees.  The most enjoyable part of the job was taking an irate patient call and being able to make them smile by the end of the call."
bad,"I love working with these nurses and doctors on the daily. They make it worth going to work everyday. However, you can’t provide focused patient care without constant interruption. IMobile equals constant distraction and room for medical error. The administration runs the hospital like a factory. We have to fight tooth and nail for what seems to be scraps as a budget. They will call you on an iMobile that your forced to carry while providing patient care to explain why we haven’t clocked out for a break yet...seriously? They abuse their policy making to fit whatever bologna they are trying to feed us, at a whim. They don’t care to listen to there well educated medical staff for proper ideas of running the units. They abuse the good nature of nurses and doctors to to boost their own wallets despite patient safety and well-being.If the corporate side would listen to the medical professionals about how the hospital should be ran, stop micromanaging every little detail from the highest level, encouraged the staff nurses and charge nurses to use there professional autonomy to implement best practice, and realize that a medical business such as a huge hospital cannot be hounded by those upper management clock-watchers every time they think we have to go on break or clock out by a certain time frame."
bad,"Glad it's in the past. "
bad,"Upper-level management is inconsistent with promoting, following, and enforcing policy.  They chose to pick and chose which policy to follow and when to follow it, based on the benefit of the management and not necessarily the staff or patient.  Bullying is Not addressed or enforced and allot of really good staff leave because of management doing what easy instead of what is right."
bad,"I enjoyed working with my team at HCA, however, upper management was not sensitive to the labor required to operate my department. This resulted in my working to perform job duties that were outside of my position.  I left HCA Hospital System due to my work/life balance.  I worked late every night and every weekend."
bad,"The Management team within HCA Physician Services group are very small minded and do not like change.  They have established a ""Mean Girl"" type culture in which if they don't like you, they vindictively pick with you.  In addition, they do not have a good work life balance.  You have to use PTO time to take off on vacation days that the company has already allotted you."
bad,Many great people but it is a place where most advancement potential is first offered to relatives of the company leaders.  Hospital management turns over too often for anyone to take accountability.
bad,"Extremely poor management.  Employees stab each other in the back because the director of the department does that and the culture flows downstream.  It wasn't always like that.  We miss our previous director!  But, he left because of the other jealous poor managers.  They just pushed him out, but he was a GREAT leader.  It's amazing how the bad seeds push out the best."
bad,Hospital environment is stable and the same like all others. No opportunity for career advancement. Most enjoyable part of the job is that it is not micromanaged and they are very flexible with your schedule. The hard part about the job is lack of communication and no opportunity for growth or increase in salary
bad,"HCA is a great hospital but not a great place to work. The equipment is very outdated as well as the facility that you work in. There is no organization within the department, no career development plan, no advancement opportunities, as well as lacking in training for all new associates. The HR department is very rude and actually said that I am not to contact them going forward when I did not receive my check. I was very hopeful in going to work for HCA but once I was there, I knew it was not the organization for me."
bad,"I was not great at details during the time I worked there, and struggled for years. It was getting even more competitive and fast paced the last several months, and I had been unhappy for some time"
bad,"I've been through two separate tech managers in my years with HCA and both have been extremely unreliable when it comes to support.  Most of the time when requests are made for support they get ignored or ever worse, promised they are being taken care of but nothing is ever done."
bad,Poor manager of radiology who is not easy to work with. Loved learning new things at this hospital. Difficult to balance life and work with steady turnover.
bad,"Hard work , tough environment.  Felt like working in a slave-ship.  High turnover, poor management.  Very difficult to work as contract staff.  would not recommend to a friend."
bad,"Work was very fast paced. A high volume of phone calls, Checking in and out of patients. Registration input, scheduling, setting up testing and Chemotherapy. Management did not seem to be present very often. The culture was okay. Hardest part of the job was lack of help for a very busy office.  The most enjoyable part were my work companions and the doctors. The patients were the best."
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
good,"I hope they did something with the overall management, and this is just north suburban medical center. I was in school when I got hired there, then went back to school but the management wouldn't support my school."
good,"No going to talk about work place not willing to  share ... Started working 09/1997- 09-2019 ,....That's all I have to say ... Stop trying to make me talk about work place....I will not use this  work site .... If this is required .... Should not be .... I have the right to elaborate if I dont want too..."
good,Fairly good pay for the easy work being done (ER Followup). Not a job recommended for anyone that has obligations to family or school. Clear communication between site director and management team does not exist. Call center environment run as if it  is a hospital work environment in regards to the strict attendance policy.
good,"Unless you are part of their social group, you are treated like you are worthless. All they care about is the money they bring in and care nothing about the people who live there or work there."
good,"Little consideration of work-life balance for employees that travel for the company on a weekly basis.  Expected, and required, to forfeit weekends and other personal time without compensation of any kind."
good,"the hardest part of the job is that they dont tried to work with you schedule and that you can get beat up, spit on, cursed out, poor training and thats on a typical day at work, Have to work weekends."
good,"Orlando could be a great office with proper leadership.  Currently, it is a toxic work environment.  HCA as a company headquartered in Nashville, is a wonderful, professional, caring company.  They just need to get Orlando under control."
good,"Worked for HCA Healthcare for 5 years within different departments. "
good,"During my employments with HCA, company had 3 restructuring processes. What does it say about the company? Few weeks after start my line had been asked to leave. I had no handover and no support whatsoever for 2 month since line manager left. Half of the team had been made redundant. Recruiting process is rediculously long - from the date vacancy had been advertised to initial candidate's start date might take up to 3 months! "
good,"HCA Corporate is the true definition of  a corporation (large volume of FTEs, bureaucratic nature, devoid of culture, highly paid executives, etc.).  If you are looking to jump start a career and move when the wind blows then you will fit in just fine. Many 15-20 yr veterans of the company who like to reminisces on ""the way things used to be"".  Good experience with a cross-functional (contained all in one) company so you see operations form many angles."
good,saddle up and get ready for a hard ride ! you have to be strong and kind and resourceful. you have to be open to working 7 days a week. be careful  there
good,"HCA as a company was great, but things started to change and new management was not following HCA mission and values. Work life balance was not there. Worked on weekends sometimes just to try and catch up, but work was still never good enough. HEAVY requisition load!!! No appreciation for recruitment team. Great medical benefits though!"
good,Not disgruntled just disappointed but is still a good company to work for. And they are active in the community. Caring for human life should really be number one.
good,Honestly for such a large company and being in healthcare the benefits are terrible and all are tied to their Hospitals so if you don't live close to one you are out of network
good,"A typical work day you are repling prepared for what ever come. "
good,"Outsourced. Good money and plenty of work, hours, benefits. Manager was not accountable."
good,The good things that HCA hospitals does is good patient care and customer service. Maintaining quality advocacy. HCA is always coming up with innovative policies and procedures. The bad things HCA is known for are pure for profit company; and insurance driven. Possibility of advancement is minimal
good,New head of HR - please check backgrounds of those that apply for HR positions & those that are actually hired.  Majority don’t have the experience listed on the job description.  HROC - you will not advance to HR positions because of your performance...you have to know someone.
good,Loved the people I worked with at my HCA facility. The management was poor and everything was very poorly run. Staff was very over worked and they cut corners where they shouldn’t have. Didn’t respect. You were replaced quickly
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
good,The pay is ok. Management does not do a good job of backing nurses. Doctors are not held accountable. My boss is terrible at her job. Very passive-aggressive. Never advocates for staff. You do get to learn a lot. Very busy most of the time.
good,"This corporation ought to up their pay rates for worthy employees expected to dedicate energy and their lives to the work, namingly, supportive staff."
good,"Nothing to say glad I no longer work there.  Feel sorry for those who still work there"
good,"I worked as a network engineer and the work was plentiful. Management and Co worker were a nightmare and ruined what could have been a good place to work. "
good,"But mgt micromanaged employees and had favorites.  Was very unprofessional, and would acknowledge us like we were invisible, if you were not in the click."
good,job function was required to do much more than originally assigned. when short staffed would have to pick up extra duties and hardly got any help so stress played  a huge factor.
good,"My experience with HCA was great for almost six years. That was until a person was put in charge that should not have been put in charge. It came to my attention that HCA is very clickish, and if one does not kiss up to the right people, you may be black listed for life... "
good,"Transformation and transition into shared service model resulted in misaligned leadership and impacted employee satisfaction."
good,"During my time at Healthcare Partners, off and then back on, they provided stability and fun. Management seemed to care about employees and provided training to keep us updated on all the HIPPA laws and new aspects of the company"
good,I loved my job with HCA only to be completely discouraged by my current manager. She is incompetent and lacks professionalism on all levels. The hospital structure is guarded around politics and not work ethic and hard work. Great stepping stone but no hope for career advancement or growth. I would never want to work for this corporation again.
good,"Great place to work for meeting stron people"
good,"Great coworkers, poor management, hight turn over, salary and compensation are terrible.  No room to grow within the company. Long term staff have left due to several bad reasons."
good,"Very unorganized and hectic. No sense of direction or ability to maintain full time hours for employee's.The employee's are great and fun to work with however, the higher ups do not make for a conducive work environment"
good,HCA is a good company that values its employees. The Physician Services Group has grown tremendously over the past 5 years. Great benefits package that did not increase in cost.
good,"Much overtime is offered and frequent calls to come to work, but at the end of the week, the management cuts you from the schedule, which takes away your overtime."
good,come look at the work see my individual i'm going to be take care of today if i'm going to be doing meds or cooking if we going to be taking the individuals out or not
good,"All staff on site in prestatyn are livley, will help you out with anything."
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
good,"Management style and work life balance varies greatly depending on which department you are in. PTO structure for those in HR is very poor. Despite many complaints and problems recruiting because of poor PTO, no change is made."
good,HCA Corporate is an easy going and decent place to work. The difficult part is there is not much room for advancements within except for jumping around to the many facilities within the region.
good,"Managers don't stay."
good,"Once HCA took over a lot of things changed with management. As an employee, we did not feel valued. Our voices felt as they were no longer important and/or taken into consideration."
good,"ACNO is in over his head.  The CNO is unsupportive of the nursing and nurse managers.  She has no real vision for nursing.  Does not address the issues, but instead allows things to happen and enjoys the chaos."
good,After being contracted for 7 months I don't feel like I have progressed in my career. No talk of me getting hired on soon. I only have communication with my contracting company. HCA offers no benefits or job security for contractors. The process of development is fine depending on the project. The hardest part of the job is communication. The knowledge I have learned from HCA is massive. I love that I come to work and learn something new almost every day.  The workplace is very professional which sometimes limits communication on projects. Overall I fell like HCA could do better on communication with their contractors and active directions to developers.
good,"I had my job because it paid the bills, unfortunately I wish the directors and coordinators would care about the employees well being instead of solely focusing on the patients, at the end of the day we're the ones being over worked and taking care of the patients. I had a very hard time working full time and attending school."
good,"HCA tries to be a good company to work for, however in the currant financial climate and opening of many other private facilities HCA is now going through a lot of re-organisation and difficulties. In the short term it is a good place to gain valuable experience but under the currant climate do not expect a long term career or much support in regard to courses and further career development as they do not have the money."
good,"HCA IT&S is a solid place to work for the right mindset.  "
good,They don't care about your personal life. The travel is crazy!! They will switch your travel at the last minute and expect you to be ok with it. THEY SHOW FAVORTISIM!!!!
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is the assisting of hospital staff in their daily tasks. When able to impart knowledge and tips to getting their job done, that they are able to do themselves, makes me feel great."
good,"Good company, with great colleagues always willing to work as a team in order to execute our daily responsibilities. In addition, management should take more control of colleagues scheduling patients at a reasonable time in order for their employees to have a work/ life balance. Benefit package is lucrative, health benefits, 401k plan, profit sharing, etc."
good,great heart team and Icu but management is only concerned about one thing and that is kissing the doctors behind. Thankfully they came in and fired the worst offenders. They have great nurses but your opinions are not heard and dont even think about reporting physican behavior
good,"I just need a new challenge in my life. I don't feel valued by my supervisors."
good,"The HROC facility is a 24-hour operated call center, which allows for a more flexible work schedule and the ability to assist employees with concerns/inquiries around the clock."
good,Salary was below industry average and did not find employees from within getting promoted. Lots of turmoil with upper management which left everyone else confused. Co-workers were all dedicated and enjoyed learning a lot.
good,"coming into work with a happy face ready to see and do your job better than before. Respect for everyone (managers and co-workers)."
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
good,"Very comfortable with working claims and interacting with Insurance companies. Have learned about medical procedures, coding, case rates and the way bills are reviewed and paid. The hardest part of my job is waiting for a team lead or manager to clear a claim that is paid correctly or has reached it's final level of appeal. The longer claims are held, the more they are touched and this results in poor time management. I enjoy the challenge of working a claim and being able to tell how it was paid and how it should have been paid."
good,"The job pays well and there's security, but the culture is lacking and the work is less than innovative. They don't want to push the boundaries and try new things."
good,"Pretty average, good coverage. and up to date information "
good,While my position is said to be health care based the reality is it is a sales position. This is a lead generation position where the most important goal is to obtain patient-consumer demographics. The company utilizes any benefit for its own promotion. If the employee does not agree with the direction the marketing is taking then they encourage the employee to seek new employment opportunities. In this position there is no lateral option nor a ladder for higher positions. The hardest part of the job for me is the inability to work independently. Every action you take while running the inbound calls are governed by supervisor or company protocol. I have learned dedicating time and service to this position has allowed my best skills to decay. This is an unfruitful position leading to barren opportunities.
good,"The first 2 years were amazing but after they transferred me and changed management, I lost interest due to poor treatment and lack of communications."
good,Performed level category assignments of Emergency Department accounts.  Revised patient charts daily for accuracy on accounts. I enjoyed working for HCA.
good,Admin. is too focused on corporate goals instead of patient care. Need more of a clear line of leadership from adminsitration at local hospitals. Doctors are great to work with
good,"As in the overall trend in healthcare, staff are working 2-3 different job responsibilities on average.  Meetings are at times excessive.  Overall, fair to average place to work"
good,"HCA is a solid company to work for and they offer great salaries as well as an overall positive work environment.  However, due to much of the ""good ol boy or girl"" system at play, advancement, depending on which department you are in, is going to take a while.  Their IT&S department is the most progressive because OBVIOUSLY, they have to be in order to remain competative."
good,"Overworked nurses makes for a stressful day."
good,"Patient and staff ratio is dangerous. Pay is a joke. Our hospital is seen as being low on the totem pole because we are a ""rural"" hospital............"
good,"Major management turnover, jobs being outsourced overseas.  Remote work and flexibility was an asset.  Micromanagement.  Typically worked all holidays."
good,"I wish HCA would be more competitive within our KC market when it comes to benefits, PTO and salaries.  Senior management is involved in daily operations and works to resolve patient suggestions or complaints."
good,"Working with the team to update the 60,000 provider accounts in the system for reporting and daily updates.  The hardest part of the job is having tools to do the job but not being allowed to use them."
good,There is heavy favoritism in HCA and management doesn't provide a good working environment. There are multiple time where a team lead or manager will tell you something and then go back on their word and throw you under the bus to make themselves look better.
good,The workplace is conducive to the type of work performed. It would be more beneficial to be compensated for the amount of work that you have to complete. Some policies and procedures could be updated.
good,"I had the opportunity to see the RT department grow and be productive to the point we were respected by most everyone in the facility."
good,I requested for 2 1/2 years to transfer to a different position.  My co-workers were great.  I did not care to sit in one place all day.
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
good,You have to be willing to work really hard because there are limited opportunities to advance into management.  There are long work hours to make up for low starting pay.
good,"My job on a typical day is to pull report for next day appointments for"
good,"Over all the experience was as pleasant as can be, they were very welcoming easy to talk to and offered the necessary information for me to feel completely ready to tackle the task at hand"
good,I have been on this job a number of years.  When I first came here I loved coming to work felt valued as an employee. Now I drag getting up in the morning going to work not the same anymore.
good,"Feared for my job regularly based on her, coworkers great.  Executive management very unaware by choice of Directors behavior.  Eventually it lined out, but it was after I chose to find employment elsewhere."
good,It was a decent place to work but you had to be well into the group or you did not get some of the privileges. My manager was not experienced and some of the supervisors knew very little.
good,"If you have one client that gives you enough hours to work- the work is rewarding. If you don’t- you end up working 2 hours here 2 hours there that will keep you going to work and not making enough money to pay your bills."
good,"Over my two-plus years at HCA, the executive turnover was quite high, which resulted in many changes in direction and a lack of clarity in our mission."
good,"It is a good starter hospital job to get your experience and go after the first two years."
good,My work performance at HCA involved registration and insurance verification.  I learned how to navigate through various software from on job training classes.  HCA is definitely not a diverse employer  and unfair to minorities whom are trying to transfer to other positions in hopes of opportunity.  The hardest part of my job was coping with managers whom were bias of others.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a smile on a patient's face.
good,lack of diversity  keeps the company from truly becoming a top 5 company in my opinion. I often work around the clock with little no compensation. Work life balance could be better.
good,"This is your typical for profit company that focuses on the bottom line. However, this company takes focusing on the bottom line to a new level. A highly matrixed company that is very rigid in their ways with little desire to look at innovation and change externally."
good,Working nights was hard because management was only there during the day and on the weekdays. Any meetings were scheduled during the day so it was hard to attend.
good,Worked on a fast paced floor as a prn nurse.  The ability to self schedule worked out well enabling a good Work/Life Balance.  Management changed often.
good,"HCA is a good company but the opportunity to advance in support staff roles is just not there. The hospital industry is primarily for those who do direct patient care like nurses, doctors and other medical practitioners . If you are the supporting players like marketing or information technology get your experience and then find another gig because there are really no advancement opportunities and your core skills will be wasted."
good,Very rewarding when you work with the patient's and know you have made a difference in the life. Benefits are great. The Cath lab manager that I worked under was not helpful. But she has since left HCA
good,"Job ok"
good,This is a huge corporation great benefits but unfortunately the smaller management people take advantage of the employees so they could be notice by the directors.
good,"Having worked there for just over a year the changes that have happened made it impossible to stay"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
good,"Long, exhausting, under staffed, poor pay, stressful"
good,"Do our job to the high standards, have breakfast time, and lunch time finish our jobs, give the reports to our supervisors change clothes and go home."
good,"I worked for this company for more than 10 years and before I left I realized how the moral had gone down. We used to have wonderful Spring activities for the employees that allowed us to have 1 full PAID day to spend as an Employee Appreciation. In recent years this has now gone down to the last 4 hours of the day. Then we used to have some really fun Halloween contests that allowed us to dress us and decorate our departments but this too has gone down due to a drop in moral. We used to celebrate Thanksgiving with a really nice catered meal and then weeks later we were given the treat of a Tamale breakfast but in recent years they mashed the 2 Holidays together and I really have no idea why."
good,HCA is a good place to work. There are several different departments and schedules available. Everyone at HCA is very friendly.
good,"The ethical focus of the company is top notch. Unfortunately, where the rubber meets the road in terms of how the organization handles and develops internal talent is poor. It has become more about who you know than what, and HR is completely ill equipped to develop and promote talent from within ( and no, a couple small and poor advancement programs don't cut it). The pay is also poor especially in terms of talent that stays more than a few years. To get what you are owed, you must leave the company and return a few years later from somewhere else."
good,"A day at HCA is like drinking from a fire hose.  In my tenure at HCA I have learned several key components/processes in the Project Management field.  The management is nice and courteous, as well as, my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job is knowing everyone’s roles, responsibilities, and who to go to in order to get tasks completed.  The most enjoyable part of my job is completing a project within budget and on time."
good,When I started we were lead by an excellent Administrator.  He made sure we felt valued and continued to keep the facility operating at or above profit expectations.  After he left the facility entered a state of turmoil and management shifted on the clerical side and the clinical area three different times.
good,Productive and very busy. Had to meet a deadline each day. The job was very stressful.
good,"Great Place for healthcare, benefits could be better."
good,"Have worked weekends at the call center office. Extremely busy-"
good,"HCA Physician Services is a great place to start your career in healthcare. The exposure to the many facets of group practice management, operations and finance is second to none."
good,"Unresonable goals set each month, especially when previous goals were met & exceeded."
good,"Interesting job that changed requirements daily, enjoyed my time there just with there was more room for advancement."
good,"worked as a medic then a nurse, job load was the same for each, can be stressful at times but overall it was fun.. Enjoyed most of the other staff except some new nurses when they think they now more than seasoned nurses or medics"
good,"The work load is typical and predictable, however, pay is so-so  & management pushes their own agendas. Not much room for advancement, they hire to put you in one spot and keep you there..."
good,This is a good organization to work for as they are for the promotion of their employees. They support promoting from within. Their training is very thorough.
good,"Though loosely followed, HCA has an incredible mission statement to aim for excellence. HCA provides opportunity for employees to be reimbursed for student loans and continuing education."
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
good,I work here not for a long time as a bank healthcare assistant. Enjoy being part of the 5th-floor cardiac team. Very good professionals with a high ethnic characteristic.
good,Good agency to work with.......plenty of hours....you learn new skills on the go... meet new people....the stuff it's always responsive to your needs.
good,"HCA offers excellent benefits for their employees overall, but the workload is heavy, especially if you have direct patient contact (RN, PCA's, techs, etc)."
good,"Good place to work. Resources are unending. Difficultly will be found with advancement outside of the HCA ""format"". As upper management changes, processes and overall focus often changes as well, regardless of the successes that may be experienced systemically. Overall I would not have a problem recommending as a great place to work."
good,The company as a whole is good but department wise need to be assessed in terms of employee worth. The option to work from home in IT time to time should be enforced as it helps with employee shifts being that traffic is often an issue with timely attendance.
good,A new part of the HR family with new process and procedures that are changing on an ever day basis. The department as many knowledgeable people who are always willing to help when asked.
good,"I enjoy my coworkers and appreciate the mission. However, there was a realignment within the organization that brought in new leadership that is destroying the culture where I work."
good,Some employees have more say so over the supervisor. So it was very frustrating working there and i did it for 3 years. I just want to move on to better thimgs in the work place. So thats why im looking for a better company where the employees cant and dont tell the supervisors what to do
good,"The Project Management Assistant Program is face paced, competitive, and challenging. The program is designed to accelerate your career at HCA and employees usually see 3 promotions within  the first couple years"
good,"High energy and quick moving environment, required heavy use of research and analytical skills on daily cases to find errors in claims for insurance denials."
good,I worked for my aunt i didnt like it. That's all. Idk why I have to do this. This is a little dumb. Idk this hca corporation. I was just a hca thru the state.
good,"HCA promotes a collaborative work environment. A typical workday contains a meeting, troubleshooting and problem solving. HCA also promotes systematic structure."
good,Standard bedside nursing position (no frills); unstable management currently; has the potential to be a great children's hospital because of the staff working at the bedside
good,Mail for HCA on daily basis. IT was a temporary job. Also did some verified the providers information.  Happy place to work.  😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
good,I believe HCA is a fine company but they bought 7 hospitals at the same time and were not prepared to handle the task efficiently.  It took 3 months to figure out our Dept was basically what they do out of Memphis. It was very stressful on my staff waiting and wondering what they’d be doing or if they still had a job.
good,"Review contracts, EOBs, and other documents to determine how insurance should have paid. Follow up on any discrepancies.  Often stressful with little mentoring."
good,The copmany is top heavy hiring a lot of people in senior management. The people on the bottom have a huge workload to carry. Unfortunately they are not compensated well for the good work they are providing to the company.
good,You work all day and get brain fried in the call center. The turnover is really insane. I stayed for 4 years because of the compensation but had enough. The female supervisor is amazing she truly cares about her team.
good,They offer work from home position and pay a stipend for your internet service every month . They give gift cards at the holidays and do a big anniversary week with bingo and raffles once a year with a cookout.
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
good,I don't really have a lot to say about this job.  It was okay at first until I changed managers. No room for growth or they did not want to at least attempt to allow you to explore.
good,The job I perform is important because I believe it makes a difference in people and their lives. The people  I work with get along which makes it a fun place to work
good,"You had your own desk and could work independently, there were few deadlines and you knew your job priorities at the beginning of the day and were not micro managed."
good,"Stressful job as safety officer, environment of care, and emergency management coordinator.  I was considered full-time but only received pay for 32 hours a week.  However, the jobs took well over 50 hours a week to achieve the level of excellence required."
good,very fast paced environment in the ED. Sometimes lack of communication. Management will perform patient care when really busy. Have seen managers transport patients to the floor and start iv's. management is very hands on.
good,"Clear direction of company expectations was never conveyed and lack of training and material. Flexible work schedule a plus, Benefits and salary  good"
good,"Long career with company, mostly good experiences.  As organization evolved and compartmentalized, the culture changed to become less personal and data driven vs focus on what the end provides needs are.  Senior executive leadership can be out of touch with end operations, compromising ability to balance end customer needs vs expectations."
good,I have nothing positive or negative to say about anyone or anything.  This should not be a requirement for a job search on indeed.  This needs to be taken away.
good,Overall the job was great but the management was unorganized and deceitful. We were left to our own devices most of the time due to no process and procedures in place.
good,"learned compliance and billing rules"
good,monthly deadlines need to be met with reconciling and reviewing charge off accounts.  good benefits and incentives if an employee shows ways to improve work productivity.
good,Contracted position.  I worked till contract was over.  So I decided to pursue school.  I am now looking for a job to work from home.  I want to be able to work from home and work in my environment.
good,just no organization within the department.the rules change seems like every other day.there was not enough overtime when needed training new employees was not adequate.
good,I love working here for the most part but would like a busier steadier workload in the workplace. There is not much interaction with others and I did not like that part.
good,"In IT here, you will"
good,"During my typical workday, I am responsible for overseeing my teams as they progress on various advertising campaigns. I check in and help them with any issues they may be having such as doing mock-ups or securing rights to songs. I keep in touch with clients, update them on our progress and make sure they are satisfied with the promotional materials."
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
good,"HCA, for profit hospital.  Seemed to be more interested in making money than ethics.  Told staff they were always replaceable.  Friendly staff that were lower on the ""totem pole"".  Pleasant environment."
good,"A great service to the community, placing their patients first in all they do."
good,"Full working days, many projects, multi-tasking is a prerequisite skill"
good,"The hardest part of my will be to leave it. Although I thoroughly enjoy what I do, I feel I need a challenge. HCA only has one physicians' practice in the Northern Virginia area, therefore there is no upward mobility for me at this time. I am ready to apply my newly acquired degrees and certifications!"
good,"Great place to learn medical billing and insurance copay calculation, Insurance pre-cert."
good,"Depending on what project I am working on, a typical day may consists of me developing tests, executing test or attending meetings."
good,"The right teams at HCA have an atmosphere of being among a pleasant family.  However, the first priority of the company is pleasing the stockholders and the second priority is patient care.  Salaries are competitive, but benefit costs always rise while coverage decreases.  In 2018 the company changed the 401K Match deposits at a big disadvantage to the employees."
good,Friendly colleagues but poor management. your rights and benefits seem very good at first but the management always find ways to twist words from their policies and save money so you end up with nothing
good,They are a good company on paper all the education and advancements that were promised have never been met. I wish they would provide more or better benefits. Entry level
good,Small hospital with a family like feel. Everyone knows one another and makes working there easy. I would recommend it if you want a relaxed work environment.
good,"HR does not want to fix current salary they are not paying for my experience, even after working in the company and transferring to another unit I am not on the correct pay scale, very frustrating hence why I'm seeking employment elsewhere"
good,Good company to work for. Room for advancement and growth.  Many levels to this company.  The thing I like is that the company has many divisions throughout the US.
good,Management is concerned with the wrong things. Cares more about the physicians than the nursing staff. Has a severe issue with getting need supplies on time.
good,HCA was a great place to work although I recommend not accepting a PRN position if you plan on turning it into a full time position. Because from my experience it never does.
good,"I enjoyed this job, however I was no happy with my boss, that did not understand the concept of finding trends and the time it may take to build a spreadsheet. Production had to be met with no exception time , even if you were on hold on the phone for long periods of time, which made it very stressful"
good,I love going to work everyday I worked with great people.I was able to learn different  parts of everyone jobs. I checked in patients helped with there paperwork.I really liked helping patients some was so nervous about there procedure.
good,You can't deny the healthcare benefits of working for a Hospital Corporation.  The environment did not allow for a lot of career development however so you must be autonomous to learn new skill sets.
good,I have had many opportunities to cross train in different departments. It's been a great place to start out as an oncology/ outpatient infusion nurse.
good,I do not want to leave a review. It has been over 10 years since I worked for at this place and really cannot remember too much. I missed some of the people I worked with and that's it. The pay was not great and learning was minimal.
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
good,Ou is a friendly place to work. They help you achive ur goals i move from different department as the years. And they train also. Its really not a bad place to work even if ur trying to get on ur feet for the moment are trying to get a career out of it. Staff members are caring and helpful. I will tell ppl its a good place to work at.
good,Work from home is great and flexible. Everything is always needed yesterday causing deadlines to always be missed. They say salary is average but it's not. Benefits dont really contribute all that much as a single person.
good,"You have great employees at this facility but there seems to be a lack of consideration coming from the Division and Corporate for this facility.  Because of this I feel that Kendall has to much turn around and are not able to pull it together.  There is no lack of compassionate, loving and hard working individuals there."
good,Poor management  not communicating well with the staff.  Favoritism was a problem within the department.  Not having the equipment or a   place to work when you start at the company.
good,As long as I remember the atmosphere was relaxed and growing in your job was achievable. You knew what is expected of you and you had the tools to do it
good,"Corporate office has fostered a very political and uncomfortable culture.  At a site level, there is a great deal of autonomy, so culture develops differently throughout the system."
good,"Everyone was very welcoming during the interview and a lot of promises were made, but now that I've been here for a while, all of the promises have gone by the way and are not being honored.  The mood has chilled and I'm not clear why.  Communication is poor, the lady who hired me split already and they have not replaced her.  I offered to help and was completely ignored, which was awkward, at least say, thanks but no thanks!"
good,"I've worked with great people at HCA who are definitely at the top of their field.  However, it's certainly possible to encounter some skilled personal who are not cut out to be managers or directors. A great company with great people... if you can avoid the bad ones that have too much power."
good,"在醫院手術室可以提升工作速度及應變，也增強人的互动及主动。也增加對清潔消毒的重要性。"
good,"On a typical day I mix IV's, fill Pyxis, answer phones, inventory meds, pull outdated medications, pull narcotics, print labels and look up patients in Meditech. "
good,"8-9hr day in office, 25% travel to affiliated hospital sites. Contribute to the Clinical Services focus of quality, safety and transformation through physician/clinician interaction, participation on national and local regulatory governance committees, and implementation of eveidence-based care while maintaining responsibility ot clinical and financial outcomes. Women's and Children's Team consist of 4 clinical members and a Chief Medical Officer. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeking solutions to eliminate opportunities for human error that  may result in patient harm."
good,A typical day would consist of trying to get patients pay their hospital bill in full. There were plenty of inbound and outbond calls. The hardest part of the job for me was not being able make my own calls; the computer system made the calls and you have to figure out why you are calling the patient. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting bonuses.
good,I learned Meditech platform. My co-workers were very nice. Worked there for 6 months and then was given permission to transcribe from home.
good,"Managing multiple priorities, assisting internal and external customers in resolving issues. Providing support to staff and report/data analysis to management."
good,"team is soo good, As daily activity work is challenging, with other team its kind of playing competitive game with other and fun place to learn new things."
good,"Great place to work! The hardest part of my job currently is all the call.  The most enjoyable part of my job are the patients.  They make the high stress, high demand job worth it."
good,HCA as a whole is driven by profits over patients.  Director bonuses over safe staffing. Many shifts were worked understaffed as administration walked around giving rehearsed speeches about how they are listening.
good,"If you want a place to work where not much is asked of you but there is not much reward, then HCA is a really great place to work. Parents of small children can have a lot of flexibility."
good,good company to work for but you will have to relocate for job promotion. It is a great place for work/ home balance.  I have been with the company for 6 yrs and like any company it comes with pros and cons
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
good,"Overall HCA is a great company to work for that can help advance your skill sets. It is a very competitive company, therefore career advancement is not as available as I would of liked."
good,"Extremely busy department with average daily patients served of over 150, multiple skill sets utilized throughout the day with patients from all walks of life and specialties required."
good,"I loved working there for many years, I had a great team, and two amazing leadership co-workers. We hit the ground running daily, hard work and fast paced, but so rewarding. I cross trained in every area, and learned so much."
good,CRMC isn't a bad place to work. The upper management is reasonable and easy to get along with. Work schedules are nice. Salaries are a little low for the area. All in all it's an average place to work.
good,"A typical day would be getting an assignment with over 15 patients nightly , I learned time managment, Management is new with no prior experience to be in charge of over 30 nurses and cnas , the hardest part of the job was trying to put a lap belt and bed alarm on an alert and oriented patient at the age of under 40. the most enjoyable part of the job was team work"
good,"I was laid off. It was OK over there but not as good as Nix Healthcare System. It was stressful since they did not allow overtime in situations.The work itself was simple but the amount of time was not. The amount of time did not match the workload. If overtime had been authorized which it was when I was new, it would have been great."
good,"Great office manager very fexible , kind and understanding standing. Someone that has  a heart for kids, even though she has no kids of his own.I was truly impressed."
good,I assisted some of the administrative staff on a daily basis.  I learned a lot being in an administrative role at a hospital.  Management at the time was okay.  Work place culture was good.  I enjoyed the staff I supported.
good,"HCA is a good company; the nursing ratio is sometimes too high, however, they have good training, benefits and fair compensation package.  The Las Vegas management team needed to improve communication and employee interaction.  The Florida HCA was better to work at; did more with employees, more open door policies."
good,You learn to prioritize early on in the shift. I typically work night shift so management personnel are few and far between.  Staffing adequately is the hardest part of the job.
good,"My department manager is one of the best. She comes to work focused on what needs to be done, and makes sure her crew understands the importance of their job."
good,I have received a lot of experience working for HCA. It is a good place to work when starting out in the healthcare workforce.
good,"Your day is filled with trying to reach production for the day. I learned how to code heart procedures and vascular surgery. The management seemed to be impersonal. My co-workers were very easy to get along with even though we all worked remote, we met once a year. The hardest part of the job was trying to obtain the 29 inpatient chart production. Charts were ""cherry picked"" and I was left with a lot of extended stay charts."
good,"•	Preventing impending loss and increasing profitability through negotiation and enforcement of scheduled collection campaigns, consistently achieving a 70% recovery rate of billing cycle."
good,"job has long hours but mural is very good"
good,"I do not wish to provide a review of this employer and will not be submitting one at this time. If you love your work and are willing to work hard and dedicated your time, then you will do well."
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
good,Employees are in hostile work environment due to patients are hooked on tier 3 drugs by the physicians who write scripts for patients who have never been seen as a patient in the office. They get kick backs for the money.
good,"I have learned a lot with HCA and believe in the company; however, the work/life balance is difficult when in the management world. For being a healthcare company, a gym for employees should be offered."
good,"I really like the people that i work with, but invisible ""higher ups"" are always making decisions that hurt the people working for more profit. They are always saying ""the patients are important"", but in the end, patient ALWAYS come second to money."
good,Management fees were most important. Patient care was secondary. Cost savings to client hospitals justified their fees. Most clients were located in small towns that had difficulty recruiting personnel for the top jobs.
good,Work and life was the hardest depending on hours and shifts. Management and Directors are always different. Depends on staffing if it will challenge/benefit you.
good,The CIO of NTX is visionary and energetic. Anyone  with passion for technology would enjoy working under her. Enjoyed working under her.
good,"I work 3-12 hour shifts a week which I love. I love having the extra 4 days to do whatever I need to. I love that management is understanding of emergencies, and the benefits are acceptable. I have seen better benefits at other places, but if you want a fairly laid back place to work with benefits this is a good place. The company as a whole is great especially the values it represents. Unfortunately, I have seen little chance for advancement and at the location I work there is a lot of drama. It is highschool all over again. I would recommend this job, but remember that with everything there are always good and bad apples."
good,"Lots of red tape around the need to solve complex problems that require input from someone with very specific domain knowledge that can be acquired only at HCA. The time required to get up to speed is about 6 months for someone who has not worked at the company before. Great benefits, but they match 401k only once per year which makes you lose all your compounding interested you would have gained otherwise. No sick days."
good,"OU HCA Medical Center(now OU Medicine) provided a great opportunity to see patients with a wide variety of medical disorders such as leukemias, cancer, and traumas. I gained a lot of experience identifying the pattern  of lab results seen in different "
good,"My director was amazing, however the people above her suck. Do not work here as a nurse tech, you will be overworked and underpaid. I have worked here for over a year, am told how ""valued"" I am as a worker by my supervisors, yet I make the same base salary I made from day 1. The retention rate is horrible."
good,"We handled all the Cardiac Cateterizations and between 2-5 open heart surgeries a day.The best part was working with such a smart and great team of nurses.We strived to be the best at our profession and worked very well as a team. The down side was working 12 hour nights,and the odd body fluid clean up.Rewarding all the time from seeing someone do great post -op to saving someone who went into cardiac arrest.The hardest part was losing someone!!!"
good,If you are looking for a place to work that has job security this is the place. Excellent people to work with and has a team environment.  typical day of work depends on the department you work in but is overall laid back.
good,"My typical day at work consist of checking referrals that come in, schedule surgeries and procedures with the OR along with many other responsibilities. I have learn and grown a lot in the position I currently hold with HCA. Management is always supportive and helpful when needed. I love my Job and everything I do day in and day out. I love caring for my patients and going above and beyond for them. Every case that I been part of and care for has taught me that every day given to us is a blessing. Saving lives, caring for a sick patient and providing the care they deserve is the most heart warming, joyful and enjoyable feeling anyone that enjoys and love their job can feel."
good,I enjoy working for this company but now that I am ready to transition to a new role to develop and grow it is hard to move forward in my career.  No options to be mentored or coached.  Compensation is competitive however it takes years to move into leadership.
good,"My coworkers were very nice, some of the properties were tore up but we did our best to market them and we did a very good job. It was fun and relaxed."
good,"* Leadership does not care about employees. "
good,"It’s a decent company. However, the lay off and not assisting placing people in other office in the organization put a bad taste with me. Especially when time was already invested. The pay is horrible they are not comparable with other organizations that pay based on years of experience and education. "
good,Some of the Management are not very supportive and require no Life balance.  They say the have life balance but they don't support in real life.  The think they own you and don't give any direction.
good,The company care more about money than the people who work there
good,"They don’t always have the best interest for you. It’s so much to say and experience different types of situations and heard the struggles of others, it’s different for everyone"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
good,It was alright depending on the people I worked with. Morgue runs were the worst though. The place is extremely unorganized but the employees are nice.
good,HCA is one to the top healthcare hospital systems in the US. It was a pleasure working for such a top organization  I was able to increase my net revenue knowledge.
good,Stocked all supply rooms in the hospital. Made sure that anything that was delivered to the dock got delivered to the department it was supposed to go to.
good,"Decently Waged, Mild Work Environment, Management Very Biased, Never a Dull Moment, Scheduling was never consistent"
good,"a very part time job, No bennifits available unless you can get 30 hrs a week, That is hard to get thoses hours. because you only get amybe 4 or 5 hours a day. Or they work you to death one week then back to the normal  hrs."
good,"Many of the staff are friendly.  Some not.  There is a preference to be overworked as a staff nurse in comparison to travel, agency, or contract nurses."
good,I would love to return to HCA in anytime only problem is I just pray that they have a fully stocked staff I have worked an entire floor by myself along with my nurses
good,Great Great Training and development.  This company really knows how to invest in their employees professional development.  You work hard and they know how to get the most work from the fewest of FTEs
good,Highly matrixed organization with sometimes competing priorities among the different leadership levels. Very successful organization focused on providing high quality patient care.
good,Ok Job. Pay isn't great. Benefits are minimal. Great director and manager. Hate being hourly. Only hospital I've ever worked for where benefits dont start on day one
good,"Typical Day: Every day was different. That's what was fun and exciting."
good,"There are a lot of things to say. But it's a good start for an office career."
good,The most difficult part of the job is that you may be asked to float to other facilities and areas.  This disrupts job routine and efficiency.  I believe it is important to maintain stability and moving around does not promote this.
good,My typical day at work was opening the office and preparing the reception area. I made sure all my medical records were in place and I took the phones off of the system. I registered all incoming patients and collected payment.
good,"Solid pay and bonuses, very poor PTO policy for incoming employees that are not 'grandfathered' on the old plan"
good,"Great nursing job,management needs some pointers,prep/post op pt care, learned o.r. processes,"
good,i work 3 days a week 12 hour days and find that that is the perfect schedule.  i get vacation days every payday.  flexible time off.  maximum patient exposure.  the most enjoyable part of the job is the patients
good,"Issues left to linger far to long, I think if management took the concerns of their employees more serious the stress level would decrease. Other than that this is a wonderful place to work."
good,"I enjoyed my time with the company."
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
good,a typical day at work centers around your cubicle and a computer. You wont learn much on the job other than medicare and medicaid guidelines. Training is sufficient and they cover all basis so they have a legit reason to terminate you if you dont make production. But dont fret production is very easy to make. To be honest the worst part of this job is the pay!
good,"Excellent place to work, learning is fun and everyone is well rounded and hard working... you get to work from home sometimes which is awesome You get a chance to visit different facility within our division."
good,I would go back and work for this company. great work family and friends. get work experience .this company will work your butt off. they do allow time off and great medical help
good,Overall loved this job and my coworkers. Great learning exoerience. Wide range of patients from pediatric to elderly. Providers were awesome for the most part.
good,"Competitive environment with a mission statement that is inspirational, which focuses on human life. The goal to provide safe and quality care, at each facility."
good,"Don't wish to write a review. it has been many many years since working at HCA, cannot think of anything to write in this space. This office is no longer in business."
good,Excellent learning opportunities. Fast pace workplace. Different field positions available. Flexible work schedule during the week. Productive work place.
good,"It was a fun atmosphere, there was lots of scope to learn new technologies and implement solutions. Good management it was a good learning experience working with professionals"
good,"I enjoyed working for HCA and was successful there for nearly four years.  Generally, the company has good ethics and conscientiousness.  Unfortunately, the experienced leaders from my department were promoted to corporate positions and someone inexperienced got the manager position and was uncomfortable with clinicians who have more experience.  She made some bad decisions impulsively, and the company wrongfully backed her up, creating a toxic work environment."
good,"Formal professional environment. Strong work ethic and discipline."
good,"I worked at HCA for 18 years, through good and bad times.  In my last position I was responsible for the infrastructure for 40 petabytes of information on a team of 3.  The other 2 had different functions.  Needless to say we were very understaffed and life balance was thrown way out of whack."
good,"The department I worked in was only operated if the Dr ordered it. If no one was not there we did not work.During the summer months ,it was really slow"
good,Great company with outstanding leadership. Promotes a safe and healthy work environment with positive work-life balance. I was always treated fairly and with respect. I have nothing but good things to say.
good,"Very mobile, fast paced environment with not much advancement available. Team atmosphere was reasonable, and could get assistance at time. kept changing the direction they wanted to go."
good,"CSG culture is difficult and leadership is not invested in changing this. "
good,"great first boss, terrible second boss. good professional development opportunities, very flexible time off, options to work from home, young team/culture"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one.

good,"Typical day at work-easy assignments"
good,"People are great, company culture in most departments is balanced and positive.  Lots of resources and education available.  Problem children are promoted to leadership instead of provided feedback or handled.  Highly matrixed environment and bureaucratic environment stifles creativity and progress."
good,growth oriented company.  very competitive in marketplace.  strong talent throughout the organization.  fair compensation and benefits.  opportunity for growth.
good,"Good co-workers, updated work environment, management working to make progression better. Senior management working to up train supervisors to make a better working relationship to ensure that patients get the best service possible."
good,Worked with upper level management on a school project and they were really helpful and laid back. They were professional at all times and valued our work.
good,"Great opportunity to meet and work with some truly fantastic people. Not much weight is given to work-life balance, but I have had incredible experiences with patients, families and staff."
good,"Took pride in arriving to work on time,Once you go to work had to refill medication carts for the nurses.learned alot about time management,alway go above and beyound when helping your customers because the are your number one concern."
good,HCA employs many highly talented individuals who contribute to the best practices that have been deployed throughout HCA facilities nation wide.  These individuals are very educated and work hard.  Management tends to work very long hours without additional incentive.
good,I enjoyed working with the people there and customers on the phone. I enjoyed the incentives and monthly pot lucks. Great environment
good,"My typical day is a day I clock in and get patient vitals, room them, wait for doctors orders and would do phlebotomy, injections, regular test , i.e. strep, flu test, and x rays if needed.  I've learned how to do FIT and PFT test there.  I love all my co workers, they are great.  Management just needs to get more organized.  The hardest part of this job is just the long drive there.  The most enjoyable part is helping a patient in need."
good,"Major changes in the healthcare industry directly effect this company."
good,"I thouroughly enjoyed my employment with HCA, Inc. The hours were wonderful. I was able to feel fulfilled with a productive work week followed by relaxing weekends off. It was a stress free, friendly, family oriented staff. I would retun to this company if an opportunity presented itself"
good,Direct the Access for patients in to our System.  It is fast paced and I dramatically improved patient admissions during my time there.
good,"Must be highly skilled in multi tasking, articulate, handle stress well, and devoted to role.  Goals driven organization."
good,I met two of the best physicians with a specialty in High Risk maternal Fetal. My Supervisor was one of the best people I have ever worked with.
good,"Good company with solid mission and wonderful philanthropy. Stays up to date on healthcare both clinical and technical, but like many companies can improve on the administration side."
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.

good,Gives students a chance to get a real corporate work experience.
good,"Mostly a good place to work.  Several management tiers,  Good ethics and compliance program."

good,"The training provided is detailed, interesting and extremely informative,"
good,"Working at HCA has great Benefits. Stationary Engineer 1 Grade / Electrician Tx There is no advancement . Enjoy working with co-workers,and being able to help others."
good,"Tive uma grande evolução ao comandar um departamento sozinho, alinhando estruturas e ajudando na progressão de alinhamento de processos."
good,"work culture okay strict on pt privacy which is good."

good,"High Volume of candidates not enough support."
good,Productive place to work with opportunities for growth. I was able to learn and improve my management skills. I benefited from quarterly administrative meetings focused on how each facility was performing.
good,"ARNP work is very demanding. Stressful, But can be done. "
good,Upper management feels like only care about the bottom line and the people working. Over all was happy working on the floor. My coworkers where helpful and kind I will miss them.
good,"a typical work day was filled with lots of high energy work fill with team spirit and , at times very stressful, working with patients with numerous illness and you had to balance your time and care to facilitate them all."
good,"I like the modern new NICU I work in and I admire the doctors and nurses I work with.  All are caring and have great integrity  I enjoy working with the premature babies and assisting their parents through the difficult NICU experience. I love helping parents overcome challenges with their infant.  What is difficult in the place I work is the fact that management may peg individuals into a certain work/skill level, rather than cycling everyone through the challenging and crucial learning they would gain.  Everyone, in my opinion, is well trained and should be given experiences that coincide with current certificaions, for their own growth and also for the safety and benefit of the unit as a whole. I see some  managers as unwilling to train/support.  All should be given experiences of learning."
good,"larger company with micro management, learned a lot from training, culture is ok somewhat diverse, hardest part if management & employees, most enjoyable is what I've learned over the years"
good,"Policies and procedures are applied throughout the corporation that sometimes don't work well at local facilities. I believe HCA is trying to be a great company and succeeding in many ways. However, having been here through 2 corporations, locally, some things are less successful. For instance, we have comparable benefits to other facilities in the area, but pay is not as good. We are trying to change policies and procedures to be more streamlined and efficient, but the changes can be difficult and are often not efficient at all. For example, since HCA took over, the pharmacy has changed a large number of procedures and changed what they carry. These policies are supposed to cut down on medicine errors and they do, but they cause the process to take much longer."
good,* The worst part of this job for me was the hours required to stay on top of items in the Admin Office; we didn't have all the staff members in office to equally portion out work. I would easily work 10-12 hours a day which made it difficult for me to complete my post-grade school work.
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
good,"Worked in the Emergency Room.  Most enjoyable is interactions with the patients.  If you can put a smile on their face when they are there for urgencies and usually when they are in pain, it gives you a sense of satisfaction and makes the day go by."
good,A lot of long term employee's left due to new management in the practice.  Sad that upper management did not step in and rectify the situation before it got so bad.
good,"HCA/Parallon  supply chain is  a fast paced typical warehouse job. The job requires strong physical ability. The hours are long. The reward is that the materials supplied to the hospitals help save lives. This job is more for people younger then myself, however, I was able to keep up and help set the pace. "
good,"I have start work here straight away after graduated master degree. Even i never work as administrator before. However, this place teach me so many things that i can apply for the future job."
good,Fun place to work with all the events and employee participation activities everyone greets you with a smile. Turn around of the nursing staff makes it difficult at times. Not enough feedback from upper management on job performance.
good,I enjoyed working for HCA.  The leadership team really cares about their staff and the work they do.  I am thankful for the opportunities I was provided when I was there.
good,Good place to work. place where you go to work and feel like your doing meaningful work. coworkers are great and the people you meet and get to talk to make the week go bye easier
good,I felt respected and enjoyed working in the clinic atmosphere. I like working remote now but the new management leaves a lot to be desired. I do not see it improving anytime soon. I do not believe there is a place for me any longer at HCA.
good,"I worked for this company for over fifteen years, a challenging professional environment.  Satisfying to help patients and their families.  Good benefits over all."
good,"Highly stressful position. Have to be diverse and multitask."
good,"Very busy from evening which allows you to learn a lot from different patient to patient scenarios. Management have a balance of good knowledge of managing staff and providing information on processes and protocols. The best part is the staff and how you build good relationships which you take away from the work place, good and proactive environment."
good,"While its hard to find fault for giving promotions from within a specific group, it severely limits promotional opportunities when your only option is when your boss leaves his job."
good,"While at The Frist Clinic, I answered phones and scheduled for several physicians.  I learned that in any given situation you have to listen and try to understand what others are going through.   I enjoyed working with my co-workers daily and trying to help them accomplish daily tasks so that at the end of the day we could say that we had a great day and were able to work together.  The hardest part of the job was having to call patients and reschedule their appointment if something happened and the physician was not able to be there for the day. The most enjoyable part of my job was that at the end of they day I felt like I was able to help other people."
good,"Overall it is the best Children's Hospital. I loved working with children and their families, assisting to their needs. The staff was energetic and fun to work with even under some pretty sad circumstances."
good,"I was just a contractor with them, but it seems to be a really good company for which to work. The management teams were nice & it looked as though they provided multiple opportunities for their employees to grow themselves."
good,Parallon is a great place to work. It has great training on ICD 10. The work is meaningful and the flexible time as well as experience coding multiple facilities is invaluable.
good,"Team work was a viable part of this position. My able to access, identify and offer a solution to a situation was key. Interaction with upper management on a regular basis, including deadlines from the CFO regarding resolution of high dollar accounts. Time management was key as well as teaching my staff the same to achieve high overall productivity."
good,"During weekdays, there are two techs working with workload of about 24 to 28 patients. a PRN tech helps out if scheduld goes abover that."
good,"I arrived at this facility as a traveler, with no intent of staying beyond my contract. Once I merged into the work culture, i was pleased with the opportunities I was afforded."
good,HCA provides excellent benefits for their longstanding employees and considers families with specific childcare needs. They have an excellent reputation within the health profession and is respected by service users.
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
good,The director don't know how to schedule his employee i like working team but some of them can lazy at time but for the most part of it i can work by myself
good,"All good, I  had a great tenure at hca they had to phase out our jobs in charging and it was no fault of our own.  The jobs were being taken over by out sourcing and computer systems"
good,Just like any other company there is good and bad management but the people that I worked with were courteous and professional. They have a standard and they try to maintain that standard
good,I never really dealt with HCA corporate. We saw our nurse manager daily and our nurse educator weekly. We rarely saw any corporate individuals in our daily work place.
good,"HCA has been a decent place to work. "
good,"I enjoyed my work with HCA but the travel requirements were a bit extensive, with little understanding of the toll taken on the employee.  Most of the team I worked with were professional and knowledgeable.  The manager were nice people but lacking in certain management skills, such as communication.  Overall, I would recommend HCA as a good place to work."
good,We enjoyed working there most days.  The ever changing and unorganized management staff made for some very difficult times but they were always a challenge.
good,"Great organization and would have loved to work for them in the future. The environment was very collaborative, forward thinking and overall very productive"
good,"Fast paced, short staffed, management needs work but the doctors are very good to work for. Working for a specialty Practice opens opportunities for expanding your skills."
good,"Dealing with invoice queries regarding incorrect billing or wrong pricing is part of the everyday credit control procedure. Once the queries are rectified, the invoices will be paid in a timely manner. I also arrange meetings with the managers at BUPA in Manchester to discuss ways we can work effectively together to minimize aged debt and minimize queries. I also assist the self-pay team in chasing invoices, with the self-pay invoices you have to show compassion and understanding to deceased patient’s families."
good,"Productive and fun workplace, positive co-workers and team players."
good,"You were considered tardy if you clocked in 7 minutes late."
good,"Great company to work for.             "
good,"I enjoyed this job, for the most part, because it involved a lot of math, but my supervisor despised me because I asked too many questions.  I asked for the most difficult account because my father taught me to take on challenging work.  If I hadn't done that, I'd probably still be working there.  I got Blue Cross/Blue Shield, which was completely incomprehensible to me.  This resulted in all the questions, which my supervisor probably didn't have time to answer so she shunned me.  Other than that, I loved the job."
good,The work is consistent .There is no such thing as done or finished.The most enjoyable part of the job is no day is alike so therefore I'm constantly being challenged to more and push myself for better.
good,Great job as long as you make your numbers for collections. Customer calls and Insurance company calls to collect on hospital bill.management constanly on you to make your numbers.
good,"Company was eager to help you acquire certifications and continuing education hours.  Northside hospital was a great experience for me and I am disappointed that I am not still with them.  "

good,"meet new people, fast-paced with down time, learn new things about handling insurance, management is great, it is overall a great place to work, just need more hours"
good,I worked for a doctors office that was very busy and upcoming. They had 3 doctors and one nurse practioner. The phones were always ringing and patients always coming in for appointments. It was never a dull moment
good,"I had the opportunity to implement some state-of-the-art medical devices and equipment, which ultimately helps patients.  No day is ever the same, so the non-routine keeps things interesting."
good,"heavy calendaring for VP, Director of Robotics and Director of Ortho"
good,The people I worked with at HCA Industries are for the most part a good bunch of people. It is a shame that HCA Industries is not still in operation in Denton.

good,"Overall great small company."
good,"Really liked the Mountain Division - quality people, managers, etc."
good,"I came from 20 yrs of Banking, was seeking a change. Was recruited to HCA by a practice Manager, recieved on the job training. Grasped my job quickly an did very well. Decided to further my medical education by going to MA school."
good,no primary complaints about the company. pay is very competitive. upper mgmt. after switch from peds to adult med surg was very hands off and non communitive.
good,"The only complaint I have is that I was told 40 hrs./week but due to an M.D. leaving we are closing our doors 2 days/week and we have to use our PTO to cover the days or don't get paid."
good,"My experience with HCA as an intern was ok. I thought I'd be picked up for a full-time position after graduation but that didn't happen."
good,HCA gave me a good opportunity to care for patients.  Everyone was friendly and it has provided me a grest opportunity to grow as a nurse . HCA gave opportunity to learn and to transfer to different career paths
good,The different positions I've had during my tenure as a staff member should attest to this. Where I started with the company in 2004 to present  has been an eye opening journey.
good,"Feel that what I do is important to patient care. Good hours for spending time with family. friendly culture, nice people that are hard working and enjoy what they do."
good,Loved my co-workers and other employees very friendly enjoyed working there in the fast-paced environment.  The job entails sitting for long periods of time I would have appreciated more breaks because if we missed our assigned break times we couldn't get a break from the phones afterwards.

The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.

good,"Great learning, chance pf growth within the organization,"
good,My day is spent managing and growing our core physicians business.  I routinely analyze data to focus on my largest opportunities.  I also sell ownership into the surgery centers.
good,This was in the medical field.  A very stressful enviornment because you are dealing with the health and lives of everyday people.  It takes skilled people to work in this field.
good,"As a company that strives to provide optimal health care services, HCA ensures that it's employees are given many opportunities for continual learning and growth within their fields.  Not only are employees encouraged to further their knowledge, but are also welcomed to share their ideas and suggestions that can improve upon existing processes and services."
good,"Prductive, fun workplace. Great management. Not a bad working experience at all. Just the pay was not corresponding to the workload. Trickory and a lot of stalling."
good,"Not all departments have WFH days, but ours had 2 with flexibility for schedule as well.  Lots of training available and wonderful opportunity for advancement,"
good,"Good people at beginning of the process and end process."
good,great place to work.  Lots of opportunity to grow in many facilities. They have facilities all over the US and have a culture of growing employees. The company has a very employee first culture.
good,Enjoyed working with all of the people within my business unit.  A lot of respect among co-workers. At times there was a lot of pressure on time constraints to get projects completed.
good,This company is fair but very strict on productivity. Most departments work from home now but you have to be a good employee that steadily meet productivity and have good attendance.
good,Cares about doing the right thing. They believe in their mission and follow their vision of the organization.  I recommend them as a healthcare employer in the state of Utah.
good,"I like working here I just want to work in another nursing role.The PTO stinks time off  and sick leave is one"
good,This position was some time ago and I really don't feel that comments  at this time would be appropriate or applicable.Job was primarily dealing with emergency room patients.
good,"This employer had good benefits, was flexible with some of the hours, had good management in place, and provided great training opportunities.  Unfortunate that they decided to outsource their transcription work."
good,This company has a lot of red tape in regards to getting things done. Everybody tries to throw everyone else under the bus so they look good in front of the boss. Also there is no loyality amoung co-workers.
good,The people that I work with and around are great. There are several people through out the corporate campus that have been here for years. We have a great preventative for program for our equipment and HVAC.
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
good,"Large company  - They tried to make you more than just a number. Great people, if you work hard you were appreciated. Gave you a since of being a support person to help make lives better."
good,"Hardest part of the job is triage of the patients . I see patients from  the ER to discharge for multiple doctors . "
good,"I worked for the Far West Division for almost two years. The work life balance is great, management checks in frequently and there are several opportunities for anyone who wants to learn."
good,HCA does a fantastic job of teaching you aspects of the Healthcare industry.  it is extremely fast paced!  Long hours/night weekend work is probable but expectations should be set before any job you decide to take is warranted.

good,"Overall very good experience whilst working for the company, seem to be the company to work for, look after staff whilst offering chances of progression withing the company itself."
good,"I really enjoy the the environment, I work in a people friendly and easy to get along with people.  Growing opportunities and self development available if you are willing to look for it."
good,"Working for HCA is a challenge that I enjoy. The work is more frustrating that I care to admit most days, but in the end it's worth it know that the patients are getting the care they need. I love working in healthcare and my supervisor and bosses are amazing. I doubt I'll work with medical insurance forever, but HCA has taught me so much that it's something I'll take with me wherever else I go in the future."
good,"As this is my first work experience with a multinational firm, I have learnt a lot from here regarding the working culture of a corporate industry, team work with the colleagues."
good,Great place to work. Room for advancement and school reimburstment.
good,12 hour shifts 7am assessments scheduled and prn medication passes con't education dc teaching. management supportive team players. The hardest as in any job times when short staffed extreamly busy high census but we all would pull together and work as a team. The most enjoyable part of my job at St. Petersburg General making a difference in the lives of my pt's from the newborn to the geriatric pt having a gyn procedure.
good,I have really enjoyed the opportunity for growth and the way my boss tries to make work fun.  I do not feel my position holds advancement opportunities at this time. Autonomy in my position is very good as I can work at my own pace and am not micromanaged.
good,"Work/Life Balance is hard with the shift bids you do every 3 months and communication between team leads & employees could be better. "
good,"As a new nurse i was so grateful to have been able to get a job here. I did the StaRN program which was 14 weeks, class room and preceptorship. The floor i worked on was heavy and i felt that i handle myself well. The co workers were great. Everyone for the most part was always willing to help, even when i was floated to the other floors. I took my experience and skills and decided to venture out to see what else the worl had to offer a resitered nurse."
good,"No job is ever perfect, I get compensated to perform the job I was hired to do. Keeping that in mind, it is a good place to “work”"
good,"HCA is definitely one of the best companies I have ever worked for. Supportive teams and lots to offer as far as job growth. As in any job, the political climate is difficult to balance at times."
good,"I've enjoyed all of my jobs at HCA, but working weekends and holidays was starting to get difficult because of my two small children. The compensation was good though"
good,Job satisfaction is partially contingent on the manager you work for.  I enjoyed my job because I enjoy seeing progress.  Work culture is like family frequently.
good,"I enjoy my job at hca.  have been through many bosses in the"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
good,A collaborative environment to work in. Everyone works as a team. Management is supportive. The most enjoyable experience was working with patients making sure that they receive the best experience.
good,"HCA offers great benefits for employees. This organization provides ongoing professional development opportunities as well as tuition reimbursement. During the worst storm to hit Houston, Hurricane Harvey, the Gulf Coast Division provided assistance to all employees including compensation for missed days of work. For those who lost their homes and vehicles, HCA provided transportation and assistance in finding temporary housing. This is a pretty amazing company to be apart of."
good,"This job will be a great start for any one starting off in the medical field and office environment. Not for anyone who is lazy or likes a more slow pace job, very teamwork oriented and above and beyond type of employees."
good,"One of the best managers I’ve ever had, and great coworkers. There just isn’t any ability to for upward mobility or added responsibility unfortunately."
good,"Big company that has a lot of moving parts. Sometimes difficult to get things done with all the layers, but patients still take priority in your day to day activities."
good,"Overall, a great place to work, especially for clinical staff.  Each department gets their own week during year to be celebrated. To be really great, they need to update or be more flexible on some policies."
good,"The job became stressful when new manager took over and we had to meet goals. If you could not resolve an issue on first contact, then that carried over and counted against you. Overtime was prohibited so you never felt like you could do your job to customer satisfaction nor meet your goals."
good,"In a typical day at work, you have to be caring for the patients. You must be fast and careful at the same time. The people are loving, and work is a fast pace."
good,the work environment is moderate to a fast-paced atmosphere at times but there is also slow times. the position gave me opportunities to see other areas of the hospital and a chance to help in other areas to make a difference in other peoples lives. I thoroughly enjoyed my job as a patient transporter.
good,"I learned to become efficient in my role as an RN. which aided me into advancing my degree. As I advanced my career, I am looking forward to acclimating into my new role."
good,"* Regular shifts"
good,"I enjoyed my time at HCA I was able to move to different departments and learn other jobs, they even encouraged it. It could be a fun place to work especially during the holidays."
good,"Overall a good place to work, in the healthcare field. Competitive wages, with descent benefits. A strong company that tries to put the patient first."
good,"Great work environment, excellent benefits, and decent compensation. Never a shortage of work todo. My department works closely as a time, stepping-in to help each other out as needed."
good,From the beginning of the shift to the end it was pretty much non-stop running around the hospital working to fulfill all of the requests given from all over the hospital. This job really taught me to plan ahead and anticipate the various tasks for the day. I also developed teamwork and interpersonal skills due to the fact that we often shared tasks to get everything done as efficiently as possible. There were a lot of opportunities for customer service because there were always requests that I had the opportunity to fulfill and many instances where patients needed and received my assistance due to physical restrictions. The hardest part of the job was getting everything done by the end of my shift. The most enjoyable part was helping a patient with a problem that they had to their satisfaction.
good,"Worked as Dietary Manager for several years, and really enjoyed my coworker and crew. Like many food service venues, the food service at the hospital was contracted out to a private company, and managers were mostly demoted, or let go. This was due to the new food service bringing in their own managers and staff."
good,Great place to work for many years with many advancement opportunities if interested. Great tuition reimbursement especially if going to school to obtain a nursing degree.
good,"Most enjoyable part of my job is educating and building my staff. Hardest part is balancing staffing. The culture is uplifting and team oriented. Sr Leadership is very approachable and goal oriented. I have learned to include staff in decision making to improve buy in for change. A typical workday includes running the day to day operations of the unit, budget, payroll, staffing, policies, patient satisfaction, education and physician relations."
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
good,Great culture and caliber of employees! commitment to patient's outcome/experience is of the utmost! Everything is driven towards best possible results!
good,"My position at HCA was rewarding . I had the opportunity to help patients when they were in unfamiliar situations by explaining and teaching basic health care enabling them to meet their health care goals . "
good,"I have been working here for a year now and I have had a positive experience overall.  The pros include a very collegial environment supportive, creative people.  The cons have been instability in the higher management and division; so far its not affected me adversely or directly but have observed it occurring and caused me to question my jobs stability.  That said, I have benefitted financially, creatively and felt supported by my direct management team.  I can't give it 5 stars because I would reserve that for a company like google or apple where innovation and work life balance are truly stellar. That may be reaching pretty high but, hey isn't that what stars are about?"
good,Great learning environment! Love the staff. High turnover rate and can be demanding at times. My co-workers and I get along great! Good teamwork and management is great!
good,This was the start to a bright future in healthcare. Very busy but productive at the end of the day. Love working with others and I am able to work alone however I van adapt to any situation and stay positive in process.
good,"I was a work from home representative who would contact insurance carriers to collect on medical claims. I had to work at a very fast pace just to keep up the demand for the productivity demand per hour of the company. I had great co-workers, however management would not always keep me informed of issues. I learned many things about medical claims and it was a great experience. The most enjoyable part of the job is that i was able to work out of my own home."
good,"1. Very friendly enviroment. "
good,"worked with some great people, the position here was very demanding 24x7 365 no other support than myself. after so many years it will just take a toll on you"
good,"mowing, trash detail on grounds, edging, weed eating, flower planting, landscape building snow removal during winter months, construction projects"
good,"very good staff, time table are good, but little far from home"
good,Typical day at work is very high paced and stressful. Alot of deadlines to meet. I have learned alot about the billing of health insurances and how accounts are processed once a patient leaves the hospital facility. Being a team lead I have learned how to work with a help manage a department of 15 staff members. My co-workers have many different career backgrounds. Alot of which was obtained while working at Hospital Corporation of America ( HCA ). The hardest part of my job was learning how to manage and maintain a department with many different experience backgrounds and personalities. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing at the end of the day I have helped many many patients with their healthcare bills while at the same time helping the companies bottom line!
good,"Professional family environment, built upon trust, caring and going concern."
good,"Office setting, great group of people I work around. Job is not technical"
good,Great hours. Decent pay. I learned how to do a lot of maintenance on the chemistry analyzer and the millipore. I learned to do ordering for the chemistry department. I streamlined a lot of the paperwork and ordering proceedures.
good,"I like the people that I work with every day.  I don't have very many interactions with corporate HCA.  Therefore, I don't have very much insight about working there."
good,I enjoyed working with the staff on projects that improved patient safety.  Experienced a lot of corporate change of administration and my department.
good,Great place to work. From the top of the organize to the bottom everything we do is patient focused. I am in IT and the focus is on the care and betterment of human life.  The only downfall is PTO. You get 13 days until you get to 5 years.
good,"Hospital Corporation of America is a progressive organization with over 175 healthcare facilities across the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii."
good,"It’s a nice place to work, friendly people. Amazing patients. They care about families and work with you in times of crisis. Well maintained and respectable."
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
good,I work with a great group of people my Manager is amazing wish they paid more is my only complaint. Always get time off I need. I feel like my job is secure and I enjoy being there daily.
good,I was there for 2 months as contractor and waited for position for two months. It was contract and I wanted FTE. A position with another company was presented for FTE and I discussed it with my manager and asked them for input as I wanted to be rehire status. I was advised absolutely. I have since applied for positions that I am more than qualified for and I cant get a response. I believe there is something else going on as it makes no sense. I loved the company and want to go back.
good,"HCA corporate IT has a number of the most talented people I have ever worked with.  The pace can be fast at times, but it usually isn't gruelling.  In general the management looks out for your best interests.  If you are at the top of your game and are not afraid of supporting a massively scaled environment, then it is definitely worth looking in to a job here."
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. Just like any other company there is good and bad management but the people that I worked with were courteous and professional.
good,"Come to work and get my job done."
good,"I was a pleasue working for this organization. There was great opportunity for growth, development and advancement opportunities in this organization. The employee titution reimbursment program was fantastic"

good,The best part of this job is the amazing team of individuals that work here. There is a kindness of spirit that permeates the environment powered by shared coladas.
good,"I make it a point to arrive on time, I am not one to make it a habit to come in late, my goal daily is to complete all task that is required of me. I make it a point to communicate with my fellow employees, communication is the key to a successful organization. I prefer a manager that does not micro manage, but it is willing to teach and help out when needed. The hardest part of any job is working with employees that do not pull their weight. The most enjoyable part of a job is knowing that you are appreciated."
good,"Buen sitio para trabajar"
good,"Great corporate leadership, good division management.  CEO's supportive of sales, Leadership and development opportunities have increased substantially."
good,"Corporate HCA has the usual corporate professional company culture. Dress standards reflect this mindset. Dress is business casual bordering occasionally on business formal depending on the department, and personal conduct is friendly and caring but very professional. HCA provides many opportunities to learn and excel in one's career, and benefits are good. Hard work is expected and rewarded at HCA as well, and the company has room for those who wish to climb the corporate ladder, although competition may be fierce. HCA prides itself on providing excellent healthcare at affordable prices, which is awesome. It's good to work for a company that does good in the world."
good,I love working here. The only stressful part is you have to be able to work computers well. The benefits are great and I would definitely recommend to others.
good,The HCA I worked at wasn't my best desired place of employment. Like every company it has its pros and cons. They were very close to home but they're are things that need to change in management. For the most part it was an ok place to work.
good,"I loved how fast paced and challenging my job was. I enjoyed our patients, atmosphere, and the early work hours. There was never a dull moment at time of opening."
good,enjoyed working there great management and co workers. The culture was easy to adapt to . could work from home when needed and great café and snacks provided
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
good,HCA has given me the opportunity to gain knowledge and experience in different units with a medical/surgical telemetry foundation. Meeting different agency nurses who have a vast experience through their travels either local or across the states makes it for an interesting working environment.
good,"Prepping chart,scanning and  indexing charts making our turn around time for the coders . boxing files and locate missing chart on a daily basic and shipping old chart out."
good,I loved how the supervisors are involved with the employees. The training was so great and each week we would be trained on how we could tweak it up. We had team meeting and parties and celebrations! We had advancements and many other roles they allowed us to play to be involved in the Corp. In order to feel needed and vital in their industry. We bonded as friends and co workers. I truly miss NCCM OF MADISON CAMPUS TN! Wish we had not moved 1.5 hours away! Now where do you go to compare to that?! Ha!
good,"its an okay place to work before it was HCA, now its just alot of physicians and nurse practitioner leaving and or getting laid off. When it was HCA i liked that it used eclinical works but as far as having more hours or permanent position was hard. The company did not do much as far as bonus or anything."
good,Large corporation with good benefits and job security.  Also ability to transfer as a traveler if wanted.  Good training for staff and management.  Overall good company to work for.
good,"Our department is very busy with very sick patients.  We have a good group of staff members that help each other out, and we work collaboratively to give our patients great care."
good,Faced paced but fun workplace.  Learning environment and room for growth.  Management was eager to teach.  I improved my collections and billing skills.  I also got involved in Compliance.
good,"I enjoyed working for them.  I would have continued my employment, but a rival corporation bought out the contract. they were very cutthroat. Nothing like HCA was as a company."
good,fast paced but structured schedule.learned additional computer program skills.Management was helpful when additional information was need or hel;p with any other issure.Hardest part of job was when  there was an influx of patient diagnostic orders. Sometimes overloaded.Most enjoyable part of job was working with fellow colleugues and pleasurwe helping patients.
good,Good place to work if starting out in medical customer service or collections. Fun place to work and great incentives. Management staff fair and understanding.
good,"I really enjoyed the team I worked with at HCA. They were a fun group of professionals. The pay was on the low end of the scale. Also, they only paid lip service to training. Overall, a good place to work al things considered."
good,"Liked working with the onsite HDIS, he allowed me to learn about Dell hardware which included imaging and deploying over 40 workstations on my own.  I was able to get some IT certifications and it kept me on my toes."
good,"Everyone worked as a team. It was not clicky, most people were happy to help in every way that they could. They pay for phlebotomists were not competitive."
good,Can be stressful at times but benefits were good and lots of opportunity to move to different departments.  Managers were nice. Only bad thing is they don't pay a lot.
good,"Large company with many opportunities in the healthcare industry."
good,Worked with a great team of co-workers environment fostered a team atmosphere fast paced with great communication between all areas of the practice.  Providers were very caring with their patients.
good,"A very clean place to work, provided with a comfortable space to work in. Every one is committed to providing a good patient journey."
good,"HCA expects hard work from its employees yet rewards it through compensation, benefits, and advancement opportunities.  There is an expectation of relocation for more advanced opportunities yet they cover the expense and also take into account your flexibility when it comes to future roles.  The tough part can be if you don't want to move to a certain area, you really can't say no if you want to be considered for future opportunities."
good,"Nice place to work, managers are supportive. Most of the individuals have good working relationship within their department. Patient care quality is the ultimate goal."

good,"HCA Healthcare was very balanced as far as not being to stressful but very productive with the patients that were seen.  The Doctors were very knowledgeable, and took there time with each patient. They also made it a nice working enviorment. the doctors very down to earth."
good,"Great place to gain experience in the purchasing field.  Management is pretty good, can be fairly snooty.  Pay is far below the average for purchasing.  Good benefits.  Mostly women are employed so it can get clicky and petty.  If you ignore the drama and do your job, its great!"
good,This was my first nursing job and the staff was great orienting me to the new job.  I enjoyed caring for patients and growing in my experience and ability level.

good,I have enjoyed working here and progressed immensely in my career. I thank you to every member of staff that i worked togheter with. My skills have enhanced and knowledge expanded thanks to the time spent here.
good,"HCA is a good company to work for but expect long days and many projects both facility and corporate that must be completed on time. Overall, HCA is a good company."
good,Working for Skyline medicine has really been educational for me I've learned a lot and I am eager to use the degree that I have earned in this setting at a different place.
good,A typical day at work goes with team work for developing web application which ends a happy note as there is a fun loving and productive team. The workplace culture is excellent enough to achieve the targets set.

good,"Great place to work"
good,"I learned to be a team player and do whatever was necessary to get the job done."
good,"Flexible hours,approachable managers, great team work environment, friendly co-workers, This office created a worker friendly environment and an open door policy made it easy to relate to managers.

good,"I worked at Oak Hill Hospital as a nursing student during my practicum module.  The nursing preceptor I was assigned to was amazing and it was a very positive work environment.  Because I was not an actual employee, I can not comment much on management and compensation.  Some of the RNs were very helpful and seemed to enjoy helping a student nurse learn while others wanted the students out of their way and made that known!"
good,Bonus based on productions. Focus is production. Schedule flexibility is offered and time off requests are respected. Family type culture depending on department. Fast paced and heavy work load for daily activities.
good,good supervisors excellent people to work with learned clinical information excellent continuing education and workplace culture hardest part of job midnight shift good experience

There is a lot of flexibility and learning programmes as each  hospital has different specialities, ranging from cardiology, cardiothoracic surgeries, general surgery, renal and liver transplant, orthopaedics and cosmetic surgical procedures. HCA has an excellent work culture as it recruits internationally and makes it enjoyable to interact with work colleagues from all parts of the world. The only hardest part of the job is when my shifts  are cancelled and makes it hard to plan my life and holidays."
good,"I have learned a lot from this place starting from registering,charting, calling insurance company to obtain benefits, explaining benefits to patients, calling patients to confirm appointments, making charts and various office related work.

The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
good,A normal day is spent answering a ton of inbound calls with a sprinkling of e-mails requesting assistance with a variety of PC hardware and software issues.  Management was engaging and tried hard to make the workplace balanced between hard work and fun.  They succeeded.  The hardest part of the job was the rush of calls that would hit just before and after lunch.  The most enjoyable part was definitely the coworkers as well as opportunities for online learning to expand my technical knowledge.
good,"Good learning experience, worked with great people.My job was so close to my house which was a big plus."
good,"I love the job, atmosphere, coworkers. When I had 2 deaths in my family the company gave me ample bereavement time and compensation. The company also helped with travel expenses to get to see my Grandma before she died, and also when my mother died. Month later."
good,Great work at home employer. They set you up to succeed. However management changes without notice and it has become a over micromanagement enviroment to the point of being petty.

good,"new experiences"

good,"Everyone is different, with various needs. Apply for yourself to determine if you will like the work or not. To work here, one must be committed to the care & improvement of human life."
good,You stay busy in the maintenance department at Largo Medical. A transition of leadership was taking place as I was leaving. The new younger supervisor to whom I have had the pleasure of working alongside for 4 and a half years is deserving of the position and has worked hard to get the position. I will keep in touch with them and I will miss working with the department but my wife and I needed to near our daughter and granddaughters.
good,Hca is a fantastic company to work for. Opportunity is provided to grow employees however it can be limited at times. Definitely one of the better companies within healthcare to be associated with.
good,Large organization with opportunities to move.  The pay is competitive and is a generally family friendly organization.  They can be very flexible with life situations and will support you.
good,"unfortunately, i do not remember. it was 10 years ago. I think it was basically the same as the employment at Emory, with better benefits. that is all i can remember."
good,The Healthcare IT field is far more challenging than the corporate IT landscape. Not only do you have to deal with the typical issues involving  software and hardware there are many vendors and medical equipment that use technology to collect patient data on a realtime bases that incorporate multiple interfaces to make things communicate. HCA offers the technician a variety of opportunities to expand your IT knowledge outside the norm of the corporate realm.
good,My only complaint with this company is the workflow that they place on the nurses specifically is very unfair.  They need to start imposing a nurse to patient ratio.
good,"Some of the nicest, most caring people I've had the pleasure to work with. The co-workers were the best part of the job. The hardest part of the job was the 12 hour shifts and at times the patient load."
good,As the largest healthcare company in the world you have opportunities galore. If willing to relocate you can promote yourself indefinitely. Must have Masters degree or better to advance in Administration.
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.

good,"Good Environment and great place to work"
good,I enjoy working for HCA.  I have had excellent educational opportunities and have worked along side of awesome coworkers.  I would recommend the company.
good,"Everyday that I went on shift I walked onto that floor with pride and eagerness. I learned ACLS and Telemetry monitoring. I also learned how to take on responsibilities and taking my scope of practice to levels that I never dreamed. I was given responsibilities that allowed me to be confident and proficient."
good,"I really like this company they are good to work for.  However, in some case seniority and dedication to the company doesn't matter and they will let you go."
good,"productive environment as well as fun activities, great monthly follow up with all employees, training sessions, challenging, fun environment with great vibes."

good,Loved working with this company and the great opportunities that is offered to the employees to further your career or education. Always willing to train and educate
good,"A typical day at work concise of being patient when dealing with individual who can't demonstrate the control to care for themselves. Training is provided to help a care-giver provide the right treatment without failures. Workplace culture is required to enhance a diverse courtship. Communication  is the hardest part of the job is the student has no capabilities' to reply to what is being delivered verbally. The most enjoyable part of the job is watching the student achieve success,"
good,C'etait super experience chez HCA.J'ai bien ameliore la ba.
good,A highly matrixed organization.  Work in a fast paced environment that uses data and project management focus.  Focused on quality as the best business case.
good,Great company.  The people I worked with are some of the most amazing co-workers I've had the pleasure to work with.
good,"a typical day at work consists of reading care plans, administering medications, providing personal care, making small meals, charting, spending quality time with clients."
good,"This corporation on a whole was very good to the employees.  The management, however, was deplorable!  I spent 16 years developing my skills and experiences in such a manner that proved to add to my success in the position I was hired for."
good,Very good company to work for! I could always for to my supervisor if I had any issues and know that it would be taken care of. The benefits are outstanding compared to other hospitals around my area.

good,"I love my position here as a LPN telephone coordinator. This is probably one of the least stressful jobs i have had in 10 years of being a nurse. The work environment is great, coworkers are awesome, and the company is constantly showing you that you are valued as an  employee. And supervisors realize that you have a life outside of work and are willing to work with you to adjust your schedule for things like doctor's appointments and unforeseen things that come with everyday life. I think I've found the job I will retire from."

good,"Great place to learn and develop your skills.Hard to grow within the company.Good tuition reimbursment oportunities. "
good,"Working for HCA is a unique experience. The demands placed on staff are heavy; as a result you learn to become more efficient in the way you go about your day to day operations. If you are stubborn or do not like change, this is not the company for you. If you are a ""sponge"" and like a challenge this place is great."
good,I love my job here but management has changed few times over 4 years and recent leadership is difficult to comply with.Issues with getting PTO or response on questions or concerns
good,One of the best places to work in Nashville!  There is a variety of career paths that you can choose from.  The work-life balance is great.
good,"Good pay, but doors did close because of Obama-Care. After five years I still miss working for HCA. If I did have a choice I would stay in the nuclear medicine field, but because of budget cuts this is at the moment not possible. I have been forced at the time to search for other jobs in other fields. In the future I will simply have to relocate."
good,"My time at HCA was fun, and more than insightful. I developed as a designer and as an employee, with a great team atmosphere and good communication between groups, it almost felt like family. The only real complaints I had was with the office itself, being too dark and dreary, and management itself made processes slow."

good,"I think working for HCA it was a pleasure for me. Working for a company that is very financially strong in the market and that has so much potential to move forward. A day at work in this company it was very delightful because of the people that I worked for and with. The last manager knew how to lead the department in a good direction. The hardest part of the job became the monotony sometimes or work that was too repetitive, and the most enjoyable part was to be able to be creative specially with the photographic camera going to the field and taking pictures. After all HCA was a good chapter that I enjoyed and experienced in my life and a company that I would go back to work if there would be an opening in my career."

good,"Just like an aircraft carrier there is both good and bad when working for a company this large. On the good side there is many opportunities for advancement and movement. This is very nice when it comes to eventually finding the role with which you best fit. At the same time because of being so large when it comes to change, things sometimes move very slowly. This is evident when inefficiencies or processes can be improved but the changes come very slowly."

You will miss a birthday, maybe even an anniversary.Your skills will be tested to the limit. Your day may typically start at 8am end at 5pm, but then you may have to come back at Midnight to finish a project. Never a dull moment.

good,"The company offers many benefits. They offer educational assistance for yourself and your dependent now which is generous. They encourage professional growth for the employees, at least the unit I’m on. The stock option and retirement benefits are bar-none best in the area. The small company provides a “family feel” type of environment. This is a for-profit company therefore they try to remain competitive, which makes me feel my job is secure more or less. I enjoy my unit, management, and staff. I think we get a lot done and are mindful of the cost of supplies without opening non-needed items. Pto accrual should be higher as we are sent home a lot in low census. This eats up pto and there is none left for a vacation later."
good,"The culture at HCA is one of family.  The expectations is high and most teams are high functioning, but with remote working options and   value placed on family first, it is also a great place to work."

good,"Communicated and coordinated with hospital executives and high-level audit staff regarding upcoming audits, and prepared documentation and information relating to upcoming audits including timing, scope, and objective. Those are some of the things that I learned from this job. Great work place and great people."
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
good,a working environment which is conducive to learning and enhancing more skills. The staff are very helpful and everyone is friendly. Good orientation and support to new staffs.
good,I have not started working with this company yet but I can not wait to do so. Every time i have walked in to the building every one just seems so happy to be working there I love it.
good,I really enjoyed working for HCA. The open door policy most companies have is very effident at HCA.  The CEO was approachable and cared how the employees felt!
good,This was a part-time position in the hospital's emergency department. During my time here I learned about compassion. Supervisors were very willing to teach or instruct you about patient registration. Nothing seemed difficult about the job once you learn was involved. I enjoyed helping to put a person at ease during a moment of crisis.
good,"Good employer, decent career progression, regular appraisails and personal development opportunities."
good,"Although I was a contract employee working at HCA facilities I was treated with great respect and was given great latitude in how I completed my job."
good,Great place to work. Good people to work with. Easiest job I've worked in my life. The worst thing about the job is that you work 365days a year. Never closed but its a great place to work
good,Great company to work for!  I would strongly recommend this company to someone who is looking for an office job in  Accounting/Purchasing.
good,This is a great facility to work for.  The entire support department makes you feel engaged and involved with every aspect.
good,"three years working with such a great people they know what are they doing and always working as team."
good,Staff and management are great! Teamwork is one of the things that makes this facility a great place to work! Will definitely recommend HCA
good,Very nice place to work.if I weren't moving back to Michigan I would stay there til I retired. Everybody is nice so is the work atmosphere . The doctors are very knowledgeable and very friendly. Easy to approach and ask questions.
good,I really enjoyed working there as a file clerk and was sad that it was a temporary job . The employees I worked with were so nice too.
good,Great Place to work at. I loved my job. Everything I know about L&D was because all the support and help I had from coworkers and Doctors.
good,Everybody was friendly it was a family unity in the HIM department which I really liked. I was able to adapt to the ways of the department everyday and as time went on I was able to feel apart of the team. I also was able to get a close up view on what it is like to be the manager or the director of a medical records department.
good,"Every body so nice and willing to help co-workers and management , customers chat with me all the time . every day I learn how to be abetter customer service more, I learn from my director how to be a leader she is the best leader ever .I enjoy working every day with my co-worker my manger my customers."
good,great company. horrible raise/Pay scale and all they care about is getting more physicians and making them happy. just do your work and you will get your annual raise and keep your job. transferring within the company is fairly easy too. The pay again is the worst when it comes to job hopping or taking a promotion. be cautious when making career decisions.
good,"I do what is required to keep the build safe and operating properly,, I am always on call.  I like working there but pay increases are slow to come and I must beq and plead for an increase.  Im sick of that type of nonsence."
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
good,"I love Mondays, mostly because the day flies by in a flash. On a given day, during the early hours you will find me speaking to the clients, finding out – pro actively – meeting with team for half hour to communicate the clients’ needs and organizing the team schedules around the client’s priorities. I do this on Monday so that the rest of the week is well organized and we can effectively use our team’s time in exceeding client’s expectations and avoid Friday evening surprises. Rest of the week goes in delivering the product(s), updating the status with the client, answering emails and calls from our global teams. My role involves extensive management responsibilities and staying organized is not an option."
good,"HCA Corporate is a great place to work, provides great opportunities for education and advancement.  During my time there I worked in several areas under several managers and directors, and all were excellent, supportive and created an atmosphere that inspired dedication and a strong work ethic."
good,"It was a pleasure working at Methodist for 20 years with my peers  we had great teamwork and fun. We were one big happy family.I couldnt of had a better boss he was the best and stil is,"
good,"Professionally well-run organization with state of the art technology."
good,A great place to work for!! Great team work that always created productivity. Every employee was considered to feel an asset of the company. Patient care was always quality care.
good,Great Place to work a and very great staff to work with I enjoy everything about my job but the pay can in prove some. love working with people and making patient's feel better.
good,Very busy environment and a great opportunity to expand previous knowledge. Great company to work for which has made me more attractive to other employers.
good,HCA is a great company that values leadership and promotes from within. They have a highly efficient business model and care about their employees.
good,"Working at HCA gives me a great sense of pride and enjoyment."
good,"I enjoyed working alongside a varied amount of staff from all backgrounds."
good,I absolutely LOVE working at HCA. It's such a wonderful place to work and I've learned a lot from my experience here. I was in charge of the new hire Onboarding session for IT folks. I also keyed new hires from our Corporate campus as well as our field people.
good,Political environment with alot of turnover and wear many hats after your hied so caution if work life balance is important as upper management does get along well and it trickles down to the workabees
good,Great company and managers.  This company was far from my home but it was great to work for.  Lots of employee outside activities and a super fun environment.
good,HCA is one of the greatest hospital systems to work for.  HCA is devoted to developing great employee and leadership talent to best serve and deliver quality world-class patient care.
good,"When I worked at HCA, I was very happy as an employee. This company provides excellent benefit packages. My typical day as a CSR including working with vendors to make sure that supplies were sent to corresponding hospitals in our network. Logging calls that included invoices, letters, and service tickets. My co-workers were real team players that helped the process move very easily. The most enjoyable part about working at HCA was the management and how they made everyone feel welcomed. This was a really great company to work for."
good,Excellent environment to work and develop as a professional.
good,"•	Managed requirements for creating new templates from doctors and nurses through interviews."
good,I have had two internships at HCA and both have been extremely beneficial. Everyone there wants to help people like me who are just starting their career. I was lucky to have great managers who took their time with me and were great educators as well.
good,"My typical day, Medicare billing, and new training's.. I learn something new everyday because the medical field is always changing and updating.. The management staff is amazing. Work environment and co-workers are awesome bunch of people. Hardest part of my job at HCA was leaving, because I loved doing what I did!"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"

The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license.

You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems.

bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.

good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"

bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."

bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems.

It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.

good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.

bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.

bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.

bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place.

HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.

If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations.

bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."

bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!

They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."

bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."

bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"

There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....

bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems.

It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."

HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.

bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."

Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one.

Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills.

good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."

bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems.

They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."

bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."

bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"

There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....

bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems.

Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."

It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."

bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."

bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."

bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."

It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.

bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam.

bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place.

HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.

If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations.

bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."

bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!

They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."

bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."

bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"

There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....

bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems.

It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."

HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.

bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."

Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one.

Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills.

good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."

bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems.

They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."

bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."

bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"

There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....

bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems.

It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."

HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.

bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."

Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one.

Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills.

good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."

bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems.

They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."

bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."

bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"

There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....

bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems.

It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."

HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.

bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."

Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one.

Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills.

good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."

bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems.

They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."

bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."

bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"

There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....

bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems.

It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."

HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.

bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."

Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
