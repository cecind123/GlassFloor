rating,review
bad,"I've never seen a company that has metrics for their metrics. It is INSANE! Plus, the training needed to correctly perform the job is not what is received. It's like training a baker for the automotive department."
bad,"Call center employees are the face, heart and ears of this company. We can hardly pay our bills with the pay we receive. More work load every week, a new plan to learn but 0 talk of compensation. A new office has opened so advancement is out the window since all the jobs are in Arizona. It’s not worth it."
bad,I met my manager twice. One during my interview and then when my contract ended  It was a call center position which was not a good fit for me.  I was glad when the contract ended.
bad,"I worked as a contractor supporting Voya.  The company I worked for was NSC Global and they are the worst company to work for.  I left because they laid me off saying there was not enough work to justify 3 people, I worked for this company for 30 years.  They did offer me my job back at about half the salary and only 2 weeks of the 7 weeks vacation I had."
bad,"The company has employees who sleep together in order to gain advantages in positions.  When it was brought to upper management to investigate, if you were a 'temp' you were informed that your services were no longer required.  There is absolutely no room for growth in the company.  It is a multi-billion dollar company, one that invests hard-working employees of multiple companies in 401(k)'s etc, however they did not care how hard you work, how many times you were to work on time and punctual, accurate in your work-no errors, they only cared about personal issues.  The management needs to be updated, an investigation should be conducted and possibly undercover workers assigned to find out exactly what the relationships are between management and lower employees.  If the company insists on continuing to hire 'temps', they should be willing to pay them the same amount as a regular employee considering the 'temp' usually does more work than a regular employee because they are trying to earn a regular position."
bad,"No work given to me for three months - I kept asking. No manage on location. No introduction to Voya. Then expected one night to stay all night on project. I left earlier than others, so contract not renewed."
bad,"they failed to educate me on my responsibilities and then chastised me when i made a minor mistake ,  they do not care about their employees and were not very understanding of my diabetic condition .  i would not recommend this based on this"
bad,high turn-around environment very stressful no clear answers or help from mamagement when you ask a valid question you are never given a straight answer therefore the outome is super stressed
bad,Management is not knowledgeable. Inefficient and sometimes no training was provided while assigned to handle calls. Expectations were unclear and changed to the companies benefit without any care of how it would impact the client or the employee.
bad,The work was not easy but most of the employees wanted to learn.  The hardest part of the job were the restrictions placed on the employees by poor managers.  I learned a lot about other companies and rules and regulations of their 401k plans.
bad,Terrible management. Terrible culture. Oppressive. America's retirement company is mostly overseas. i have nothing else to say about this company except look elsewhere
bad,"This place is a scam. They were terrible, management does not really care about their employees. It was a terrible mistake to be tricked into working here. They said the job would be one thing and it ended up being something completely different."
bad,"Treated quite harshly on a 1099 contract."
bad,The benefits and time off are good but that's about it. The training is horrible and you will not feel prepared for your job roll at all. Management is very poor as there are no guidelines for anything so managers make up stuff as they go. You are not valued here and the pay is extremely low for the job tasks you'll be preforming.
bad,"By far the worst Call Center job & experience! Poor pay for all the job duties assigned to you. Poor training as well; I learned everything on my own. Work schedules change every 6 months. No stability & un-realistic expectations. Favoritism throughout the company. People only advance if they suck up to Management. Good, hard working employees never receive any recognition, advancement or promotion. HR hires all sorts of people who have no customer service experience & no knowledge of working in a call center environment. Several employees are ghetto, rude, no class, gossip too much, poor attitudes & lack common sense. Voya has a high turnover rate as well, people either quit or get fired."
bad,"The work environment here is toxic.  Management is in meetings all day every day, unable to offer timely assistance.  The culture is marred by gossip, finger pointing and no real solutions."
bad,"Management is horrible, very old fashioned, and they lie.  They'll ask you to try something new, and when it isn't something you like or you struggle with, they insist that you keep doing it even though initially you're told you can stop doing it if it doesn't work out. Just left a real horrible ""taste in my mouth"" overall, especially the god awful managers."
bad,"High work load, very stressful expect high quality but no appreciation or compensation. High turnover rate can’t move up even if you job shadow unless you are one of the favorites . They hire management from outside without any financial experience, they are useless to the team. They should promote fro within. They stress metrics so much that customer service suffers, upper management is either out of touch or don’t care about the Hugh turnover ra"
bad,"Training is minimal, was told it would be a 12 week training schedule. Was trained for 4 or 5 weeks then thrown on the phones. They just need a better system."
bad,"DIRECTORS in call center are horrendous.  Micro managers, focus on all of the wrong things, care NOTHING for employees, and will send you packing by any means necessary if they feel you're getting 'too good' at your job.  They don't want anyone promoted, just keep them under their thumb.  No one is open to new ideas or improvements... company only want robots to do as they say. Voya  is horribly run from this perspective, and in need of updated and more efficient procedures and practices...but they will NOT listen."
bad,"The company touts ""Continuous Improvement"" as a method for improving operations, but it feels more like they change purely just for the sake of change. Senior leadership is CONSTANTLY laying off swaths of the company - most recently Voya sliced it's IT in half. The year before, there was another mass layoff. Worse than no job security, they overwork everyone to the point of tears. I've actually witnessed two coworkers break down and cry from how overworked they were. This place is so toxic."
bad,"lots of favoritism, and Managers not helpful,do not care about employees,  just interested in themselves, C.Y.A., like to gossip and talk down to employees to feel important."
bad,"Leadership/Management is clueless. There is no direction. In my department, they only hire older women. The hiring is ridiculous. No one seems to want to do their job. Management doesn't listen to those who are in the trenches performing daily task. Working here is seriously depressing."
bad,"Worked there a year and it was a nightmare, unqualified personal, compliance issues galore, management coverups, unattainable goals, revolving new employees, many disgruntled senior employees, management power trips, too much to list, take your chances see if they like you..."
bad,"Horrible. Stay away! Management is nonexistent, processes are all out of place, website is old and slow, and no one is on the same page at home office."
bad,"manager retaliates people who speak true. its not open, fair environment. managements covers up problem. the technology is unbelievable dated with all kind problems, but no one can said it."
bad,"Management staff is more concerned with politics and optics than delivering quality work or recognizing talent. This terrible culture created by management prevents one from gaining any sense of job satisfaction. The descent benefits and compensation is not worth the stress, anxiety, and opportunity cost. This is the place your skills and talent go to die. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
bad,Was a great place to work. Past 2-3 years everything has gone downhill. No job security. Management only cares about the stock price.  You never know when they are going to lay you off for no known reason. Moving IT overseas. No life balance and constant stress.
bad,"Joined this company beginning of the year. They don't know what they do. The IT team I work in has old technology., just work on enhancements/break fix, no new from scratch projects, everything broken(database, failed upgrade project), no motivation, very very boring environment."
bad,"The HR department gets involved in issues when it is not necessary. The persistence with which the HR department targets certain people is nothing short of harassment. "
bad,"METRICS, METRICS, METRICS, that's what matters and remember that you will be treated as such! "
bad,"Difficult to imagine how it could possibly be considered to be an ethical company. Whoever has decided it is, must have no comprehension or concern about the extreme lack of respect or appreciation the company has for its employees; how little of the support necessary in order for them to do their jobs well is provided; the politics; the unrealistic expectations; or the dishonesty of the company management."
bad,"I only worked with Voya for 5 weeks due to intense amount of bullying, gossip, side chatter, fellow trainees abusing the cellphone rule during training class. In that time I told my trainer twice (he didn’t believe me) talked to my manager twice and messaged twice he was very passive, went to site manager nothing. After I abruptly resigned I spoke with HR about it they never called my back, they just wanted to pass the buck. By far one of the worst experiences I’ve ever had in a training class."
bad,"Management had their favorites.  The same favorites that they would excuse from work for golf tournaments.  These individuals often had less than great performance but were always justified. Conversely top performers were constantly questioned and challenged every week/month on if they did 110% the previous week/month how come they aren't producing 150%.  Incentives were a joke and everything was based off of personal management preference and nothing off of actual performance and sales. "
bad,Also watch your back hostile work environment . The managers of my team were constantly monitoring customer calls and emails with the purpose of replacing higher paid team members with lower paid people
bad,"Toxic work atmosphere, everyone waiting for the next round of layoffs.  Voya is the step child of ING that was a complete disaster (because of the current Senior Management at Voya).  If they are around in 5 years, maybe then apply, my guess, they wont be."
bad,"World's Most Ethical Company?  What a joke!  Since transitioning to Voya, people get let go in a ""reorg"" and only have a nearly identical position posted months later.  If you hear of someone ""retiring"" that means they were forced out most of the time."
bad,The job itself was easy however management and the constant change were ridiculous  you had managers who didn’t know how to do their job and sometimes the employees knew more than them  the pay was decent but you got paid on a semi monthly basis which was no bueno.
bad,I loved the job and I loved working there .  The locality was perfect as I worked in down town however My tyrannical boss micromanaged me to the NTH degree  and made life a living nightmare there until she drove me away.  i believe she has gotten away with this behavior for a long time
bad,"Left Voya after 2 years and I am the happiest I've been in awhile. Management is horrible. They will lie and never have transcribed proof of what was said in conversation, if an issue was to happen of what occurred. The company does not follow rules for employees rights and cares about being fined by clients more than helping the client employees. You can have excellent service scores but if you're stats are not within goal, you are not recognize and questioned as to why your 10 minute call wasn't 6 minutes. Everyone also has access to all social security numbers of people in the system. So employees are pretty much on the honor system to not steal information. Terrible place to work or do business. The ones recognize don't follow security procedures and rush calls. Will promise you everything at hiring interview.  Don't be surprised if they have a class action suit soon from their employees or a security breach."
bad,Used to be a great not good company to work for.  Upper management decided to outsource all of IT and back office work so if you want to work for an Indian company where your just a number then this is the place.  They sold off large chunks of the business so Voya will be a legacy company within the next year
bad,"very busy, accounting functions, co-wokers not very social, hardest part was to self teach"
bad,"pretty much the above says it all. They claim to care about their employees when they only care about their bottom line. So if that means you need to deal with callers that are smart enough not to be verbally abusive, but are extremely rude for 30 plus minutes at time then youd just better deal with it."
bad,Call center is slow paced and they don't give you anything to do between calls. Extremely boring job. Managers are not easy to talk to and not very friendly.
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of assisting clients with benefit questions on their retirement, loans and death benefits. The hardest part was being a contractor and not having benefits."
bad,"Don't waste yor time!!!! High turn over for  reason!  Good benefits processes suck! Salary not compatible to other companies! If you try them, get in then get out! Not a career based company! Shows favortism!"
bad,"-poor management "
bad,Mgmt here is not very good. They try to overwork you and the only way to make any money is to work lots of overtime which burns you out so bad. No room for advancement at all. The pay is low compared to similar companies in the Jacksonville area doing the same work. Top mgmt is constantly changing and leaving this company for a reason.  A dead end job is what this is.
bad,"Great place to learn the business and move on to greener pastures."
bad,Being a contact service center rep for this company may be difficult at first.  Overall training may seem intense if you are not familiar with this line of work.  Co-Workers are ok.  Management is OK.  Hardest part of job is advancement.  Enjoyable part would be the overall service you provide to the customers.  MUST LOVE CUSTOMER SEVICE!
bad,The work environment for this position is very high paced with no consideration for the well being of the employee. There is no room for advancement within this company and the compensation and benefits do not substantiate what is expected within the company.
bad,If you are able to find clients to work with or your able to purchase a large book of business then you will enjoy this job. If your not able to find clients to work with it can be very difficult.
bad,"Management knows nothing about the job, they make sarcastic remarks, and pull slick tricks. Untruthful and untrustworthy. Turnover is ridiculous, the Annuity dept cannot keep anyone due to the poir management. Which adds stress to the people that do stick around. Your not appreciated for the good work that you do but you are called out for the minor mistake you do make. The management also does not listen , they usually respond with an answer before you have finished speaking or before they even know the full scenario of what your talking about. My advice would be to steer clear of the Annuity dept if you are looking for a promising career because you wont find it there.look elsewhere unless you need something temporary."
bad,"Company has declined as an employer since transitioning from ING to VOYA.  Poor management decisions, constantly changing directions, fear of site closing and continous layoffs have decimated morale."
bad,"A lot of money was spent on branding last year with commercials during 2016 Superbowl and commercials with well known actors. This year began with a large number of job eliminations, budget cuts and a sense of uncertainty regarding job security within the company."
bad,Fast placed environment with good benefits. Need to be able to juggle many projects simultaneously in a deadline driven role. Good for people who enjoy challenges and are organized.
bad,"Worked at the Braintree Ma location. This place is a joke. No room for advancement and managers have so much favoritism that it clearly shows. You put in so much hard work but it’s never acknowledged. Not One reward for hard work and overwhelming workloads. "
bad,"Work load was extreme, very low salary, no resources, direct manager was exceptional but other management was poor, comapny was undergoing restructuring and was laying off when I worked there."
bad,"I received my Series 6 thru company, once on the floor we had minimal support and manager with minimal experience and support to the team. Never had team meetings or addressed any issues or concerns within the organization. Most communication done thru email not verbally, great coworkers and good benefits.Always tried to mentor team and assist other coworkers in our managers absence."
bad,"Meeting metric scores is most important, There is a lot of searching/reading material to get information, NO immediate help is available when needed. Pay is decent, but medical benefit is VERY expensive for two or more with high deductibles. Overtime is available, but too much can burn you out. Bonuses are very hard to obtain."
bad,"If you like sales and unpredictability, then this is the job for you. As in any company, you have to start from the bottom and prove your capabilities to the team. Be prepared to support both client facing account managers and sale representatives with multiple tasks. There is no average day."
bad,"I worked as a contractor. I was told I was doing great but got let go earlier, they didn't say it was only one position open. I got very little training, took control on my own because if lack of training. This Could be a good company but management and training needs help."
bad,"They are very hesitant to change or evolve. As an Agile Coach I was confronted by we don't need you, we know it all and a hostile approach. Thus I left."
bad,"Revolving door on resources, mostly contracting leads to lack of available resources and, more importantly, those with knowledge of the applications. "
bad,"Medical benefits too expensive"
bad,The company has no formal training program and does not promote an employee's determination to succeed.  Management does not value their employees.  It is a everyone for their self environment and entirely political.
bad,"If you have a great manager you can do well. But there is CONSTANT restructuring. So by the time you get accustomed to a daily routine and manager, you are shuffled around again."
bad,"Company allows for work at home employees and provides fair compensation.  Work load is very heavy without additional resources to succeed in the job available.  Struggling to find the correct workflow but puts it people to the test with changing roles and responsibilities.  Extremely unorganized, teamwork is non-existent."
bad,"Voya's intern program (Act sci) is relatively new and it is apparent. While working there there were many days where I would have nothing to do and my bosses would be out of the office. I cant speak for the other interns, but the work I was given did seem relevant and important, but the guidance and direction I received was minuscule --when the summer ended I had no indication of whether or not they liked my work and there was no talk of future openings (to be fair my boss wasn't in my last day). "
bad,"The building is clean "
good,"Voya could be a great company to work for. On paper, it is. However, if you are in the call center, it is not. In training, there were trainers who spoke negatively about certain trainees and the company itself. Trainers also contradicted each other and had arguments in front of trainees.  During training, you are told that you ""can't be taught everything you experience on the floor"", which is true; however, you aren't taught most of the things you need for your actual position. Also, it is said  that you don't need background in finance to do the job. If you do have it, be prepared to feel overqualified. If you don't, be prepared to be overwhelmed. There are advisers who help, but no one wants to pushed into a paid service, and it doesn't help the customers when most are unclear/not confident about the information given. But don't worry, you can sleep through most of the training, and be pushed out on the floor, as long as you do the bare minimum to pass.  You are given your passing test, and if you don't, the answers are provided to you to ""use"" during the retake-they'll turn a blind eye to any ""cheating"" just to get you to the call center. After training, don't expect too much guidance/help from those you work with or management. You are told to use your resources, many of which that are outdated and lacking in information you do need.This is why call volume is super high-Voya isn't busy, but the amount of conflicting information and ever changing policies, slow response times for inquires and research requests, or even callbacks for escalations-people will call back five"
good,"There was a huge outsourcing and layoff, and the results are stagnation and a sense of pending doom.A few organizations seem to have a positive role/environment"
good,Compensation is good but doesn't make up for lack of opportunity and transparency by senior management. Lines of business being divested past couple of years and management is trying to sell what is left.
good,This is an OK place to work if you need a job. The location is nice and easy to get to from Interstate 91. It's kind of a sweatshop and people aren't treated that well.
good,Voya's model is to outsource as much as possible to contractors. They also are not in growth mode anymore. It's not a bad place to work but job stability is low.
good,"a tipical day is good, start with meetings and then need to work on target projects."
good,"Low pay - not sufficient enough, similar to minimum wage "
good,"The constant chaos of deadlines combined with ever changing management structure make it difficult to feel at home.  The ongoing layoffs make you feel ""temporary"" at best."
good,Lacks senior leadership support.  Management picks and chooses who they want to succeed.  Plus side is they allow you to job shadow if you are interested in other dept.
good,Cut-throat environment with un-supportive managers. Flexible work schedule with allowance to work from home if necessary is the good part. involved in community service projects.
good,enjoyed co-workers and benefits. poor management and no support. hardest part of job was making people aware of your value. were told to bring up ideas and challenge norms but would be shut down each time
good,"Seems like a great place and you do get financial licenses but, you're grossly over worked and under paid. Everyone is extremely stressed due to being over worked so atmosphere can be abrasive.  Good luck! But,  the pay is enough to survive and you do get an opportunity to go for financial licenses."
good,Much to learn which is great!   The Client Transition Manager position is the most demanding job I have ever had.  Your performance is not so much reviewed by your manager but by many other outside parties.
good,"Overall, a good company,.  With that said, their is opportunity to improve the HR department as it relates to employee concerns. Great employees;good senior leadership."
good,Smaller  organization than Cigna which created more room for unethical practices. Certain management operated as a threat to employees as opposed to encouraging growth and success.
good,Great Place to work but feel opportunity to grow. Flexible schedule for some but inconsistent guidelines for most. Great facilities. Free parking and the best cafeteria with affordable lunches.
good,"It has not been a pleasant experience so far. From my first day of work when they didn't even know I was coming in, to my boss and individual who hired me quitting unexpectedly."
good,"I did not feel wage increases were directly related to performance but whether the division was profitable."
good,"This is a good company to work for with high standards and integrity.  I worked with knowledgeable hard working people.  My superiors were knowledgeable and support all career advancement and higher learning.  My director and manager were best I've every had."
good,"Voya is a pretty standard call center.  Unfortunately my site is closing and I am being laid off, so I can't rate Job Security very highly.  From top to bottom Voya pays pretty low, but the work environment is such that you can put up with that.  Company culture changed when they went public and focus shifted from the customer to servicing calls as quickly as possible with little regard to the customer experience."
good,Worked with great co-workers.  Flexible hours. Was able to work from home. Kept employees updated on all company changes.  Kitchens were on every floor with microwaves and fridge.
good,"I feel that the hiring process could be much better.  Hired on the basis of working ""any shifts from morning to evenings"" the first 6 months.  I get it could work all over the place.  After first month of training passing Series 6 exam, was told that I would be working 12:30pm - 9pm Monday through Friday.  Now it is consistency but I wish that the hiring process would have stated you would be working this shift, not may work any shifts.  Also, its a call center, so working on your own a lot and not the easiest thing to get the assistance you need as a newer employee.  The training wheels come off once you hit the call center and are expected to soar on your own."
good,Okay place to work. Voya is a new company that is going through a lot of changes. If you don't mind being overworked I think Voya could be the right fit for you.
good,"Be prepared to be expected to know everything when you start. No training is provided in almost any capacity, even related to business functions, history, business unit function/role."
good,"Decent work, consistent, slow call center, job advancement available, decent pay, horrible health insurance, ok management, laid back dress code, free foods and potlucks"
good,"great and nice place to work .very busy in the morning,the culture is great and everybody is willing to help.Easily transferable to other departments."
good,"good place to work once out of the call center environment. Difficult to make this transition, but once accomplished salary competitive with industry standards."
good,There was no clear structure.  A day would consist of many communication errors.  Many individuals did not seemed motivated
good,"Great company, great benefits financial industry is filled with great opportunities and options for relocation to other sites within the US."
good,"Company is closing the Jacksonville location, with some offers for relocation.   Future employees may struggle with legacy systems and IT platforms, slowing or halting customer care efforts."
good,good place to work learned a lot of new skills. The only reason I am leaving is thw company is shifting their focus to the West Coast and I cannot relocate.
good,"I wasn't there long enough to get a good sense of the overall company.  My manager was difficult in delivering acceptable results because her line of expectations kept moving; it was a constant moving target so I felt like I wasn't setup to succeed.  Incidentally, I had to resign as my husband got a new job and we had to relocate so in the end, it didn't matter a whole lot."
good,It is not the same company I started working for 17 years ago. In the beginning it was a great company to work for. Over time as the company name changed the work environment changed.
good,"With 20 years service at Voya (8 different job roles in that time) Voya stands out regarding the mutual respect and cooperative behavior of employees in and between departments. I have developed and maintained strong professional (as well as personal ""outside work"") relationships with many fellow employees. The working atmosphere is typically relaxed taking into account time management skills in what is considered a fast paced field due to NYSE market timing. Overall, the reason I have remained employed by Voya is because of it's employees."
good,"Your job is as good as your manager. Make sure everyone likes you and be a brown noser. Don't be a masculine guy. If you're a guy... act feminin. If you're a woman, be attractive."
good,Is a good company to work for.  People are very nice and enjoyed going to the office each day.  Not much room for other opportunity with my current position.
good,The job provided very extensive training that lasted about 4 weeks. Once training was completed I was moved to the phones in which the phone calls came in at a moderate level which was manageable. After about 2 years more that half of the team was release which made the workload more stressful for the remaining representatives. The immediate management was good at accomplishing the job with the resources and employees they had to work with. There was a good relationship with management/employee interactions. Most enjoyable part of the job was the overtime offered and the hardest part was the back to back calls with no opportunity to compose yourself before next call.
good,"It is a good place to work, but business is dropped lot.  engaged down sizing program. Looking for the company which has future and provide challenging job"
good,"Provided some growth opportunities, but could be a very demanding place to work, with tight deadlines, and a lot of red-tape, to get code to production."
good,Good place to work. Assisting customers with their retirement plans. Being able to learn new systems and use new products. Learning how to effectively communicate with customers as well as management.
good,"it was a nice company, I was there as a temporary employee- just there for 6 months total, The people were nice my manager was cool. Job was not too far from where I stayed, that worked out"
good,"Not much advancement opportunity from what I saw as contract to hire for a year.  Friendly workplace, decent culture. "
good,Typical large financial service company. It has changed from when it was ING to now Voya. Lots of tenured leaders have left.
good,"The salary is not great, management over promises and under delivers.  The fellow coworkers are great, they encourage a team environment."
good,"I like my job and enjoy working in a team environmen, we like to think of ourselves as a team that works together to achieve our goals."
good,Great company to work for and benefits were amazing. I loved helping people and seeing a positive outcome. unfortunatly the company had a down size in business and my position was eliminated.
good,"Up and coming company.  "
good,"Voya is going thru a transition period right now."
good,"I used to really enjoy working here, then after a year I started to see trends with hiring and firing left and right. At one point advancement was at an all time high and now I'm stagnant because managers favors certain people and I am very qualified.They are understaff and won't higher- due to sending jobs offshore. PTO, work life balance and volunteer is a plus. Pay is lower than normal.Management department needs improvement. I just don't feel I'm helping customers due to claim timeframe not being met."
good,"some meeting and crisis items to address, creating and working on standard work documents, assist field partners with questions they have on existing plans,"
good,Great opportunities for paid volunteering outside of work. Good benefits and compensation. Limited opportunities for advancement. More about who-you-know rather than what-you-know
good,Stressful and at times a toxic atmosphere (in my specific department). Some colleagues were great to work with others were less desired. Management doesn't always listen to their employees concerns (e.g. slow to incorporate changes). Some of management were great whereas other were not competent.
good,"Nice place to work. Cool building. Work from home nbd. No one is held accountable except the lowest employees. IT department is terrible. HR is terrible, try to get in touch with the hiring manager if you can figure out who that is because you app is lost in time and space the second you submit it."
good,"Voya was a great place to work for many years. However, it has gone through several cycles of restructuring, which resulted in multiple rounds of layoffs and decreased employee morale. I loved the people I worked with, but the layoffs were painful."
good,"Working environment was friendly and professional.  Work was challenging, yet engaging.  IT department has evolved since inhouse support was outsourced"
good,"Typical day entailed making receiving 20 to 30 calls a day. Which allowed me to learn a lot about life insurance. "
good,"Enjoyed working there with a great team."
good,Good place to work. Positive work environment. Pay could be better for the amount of work and effort expected. Management cares and attempts to let employees know that they are appreciated.
good,"In my opinion, the company is striving to become leaner and faster at making and creating change and innovation. They need this in order to become more competitive in the financial services industry. Part of their strategy over the past several years included cost cutting measures (such as outsourcing and layoffs) that created significant burden on it's remaining employees."
good,"The people and benefits are great.  "
good,"I had a daily huddle every A.M.  Then I would start my date by accessing my tickets within service now.  Followed by any projects or meeting regarding projects, then completing the daily work.  On call for i5/Linux issues a least one week/weekend every month.  My main focus is i5, but I learned a lot based on an ever growing (cloud, Linux, new versions of the i5 OS).  It was a very serious and cautious work environment.  The hardest part of my job was communication barriers with our Change Management dept.  Getting them to understand the depth of the impact for some of the changes that were submitted.  And the degree of caution necessary, per change.  I enjoyed work and learning new technologies, and hardware/software."
good,Great benefits and supportive management.  The company is a great company to work for. Training program is great and educational.
good,Work days were very structured. They put a lot of time into the employees making sure they were all ok and helped when need be with anything they could
good,"Worked in the Annuity Department. Took FOREVER to get trained, like literally months to even get started, even after continually asking. After they did finally train, they let us all know in a meeting that the Annuity business was sold. They lied to us and told us at first our jobs would be secure. Then they changed it to some of our jobs were secure and then laid off our entire department. They told the rest of the departments, after our department was entirely let go, that their jobs were safe, that turned out to be a lie too: they opened up a brand new location in Arizona and the ENTIRE BUILDING LOST THEIR JOBS! They told us what they thought we wanted to hear in order to keep us coming to work until they got their new center opened. They kept lying on top of lying on top if lying. My poor manager who had been there like 15 years was even lied to and lost her job too! The only thing that made the job bearable were my awesome Jacksonville coworkers ."
good,"I started my career at Voya as a contractor. I have to say, it did take a long time to become a full-time employee - 4.5 years. But, I was given ample opportunity for advancement and the autonomy to make decisions on my own"
good,"Voya provided opportunity for career growth, with flexible hours and access to executives.  Despite this, the company is constantly changing structuring, which leads to lessened job security."
good,Ok company to work for but constant.  Needs improvement in the management area.  I went through five managers in less than 3 years.  Work life balance seems to be good and was able to work from home a few days of the week.
good,"Conservative company by nature. If you are willing to put in the time and effort to learn and build your business, this can be good place. Flexible and friendly environment."
good,"Prior to working at Voya Financial, I had no corporate nor call center experience. I left Voya after 2 years of service (due to relocation) with a significant list of new skills, experience, and accomplishments. The company is extremely supportive of Continuous Improvement and of empowerment to share ideas and implement change. However, from my observations, the company is currently expanding too rapidly for its systems to support. Many applications are outdated, and there are several processes that could stand to be simplified/improved in order to provide a better customer experience. Overall, I believe Voya Financial will one day achieve its vision of becoming America's Retirement Company."
good,I learned that if you partner with the right people you can really learn and gain a lot of very valuable knowledge that will help you with daily tasks
good,the company show promising potential to build a good long term relationship in a environment that seemed to care about their employees. But sadly that was not the case.
good,This company was formed after the EU insisted on the break up of ING. It is a decent company but still going thru growing pains. I would recommend working here.
good,As a team member there is absolutely no down time and has been extremely hectic.The timelines are too close but the number of projects assigned are way high.
good,"Most managers allow for flexible work schedules with work from home options. "
good,I worked from 8:30 to 5.  I answered phones responsible for incoming and outgoing mail and deposits.  Prepared paperwork for clients and did client service requests.  Also did marketing for office
good,"Treasury experience in various aspects of treasury services, bank account management, financial reporting, treasury operations internal, external auditing procedures and project management in a corporate environment."
good,Overall Voya is good company. Good benefits. I believe they do not have competitive pay structure. Teamwork is great. Managers are friendly and encourage you to grow
good,"Worked there for a number of years, but with the most recent merger, was forced to leave. Voya is a good company, but their lack of financial incentives and tendency to not look at the big picture can be damaging to employees."
good,Great company to work for and centrally located in the state.  The campus is new and a great working environment.  They support a health work/ life balance.
good,"As they say people make the company, and the people I worked with were fantastic. They wanted you to succeed in your job, thus wanting the company to succeed as well."
good,Need more transparency from management on certain career objectives. Org changes need to be communicated way more clearly.  People are friendly for the most part.
good,"Its a very good experience working with such a very good team which enhanced my technical skills by working on many applications like SPONSOR WEB, TPA WEB, AAME and several Batch jobs."
good,"A company that is going in the right direction, is really working at keeping its employees happy. Has different industries to work in such at 401K, Insurance and Financial. It has offices in Windsor, Jacksonville, Atlanta, Minneapolis."
good,"I really enjoyed my coworkers and my bosses were awesome. The company used to be quite chaotic as ING, but that may be different with the revamp as Voya Financial."
good,Great people working hard. Everyone wants to improve and help eachother. The headquarters has a great culture - very progressive and cooperative
good,Amazing place to work at. Competitive Salary and benefits. Good work/Life Balance. Growing and constantly changing to improve profits.
good,The management was very nice there. I worked in the call center so there are metrics etc to meet. Your headset is like handcuffs. Otherwise I enjoyed the management and coworkers.
good,"Employees and management are friendly. Area was stressful due to company downsizing but employees were trying to stay positive."
good,"Good place to work.  Learned various task. I enjoyed working with the different areas of the business.  I worked directly with management, clients, agents and brokers."
good,Great co-workers who make the place fun and lively. Some managers are not in the right place and generally have a cumbersome hierarchy where middle management does not do much.
good,"My experience and background align with this position.  I am enthusiastic, energetic, and highly driven, with skills and tenacity to solve problems by implementing creative solutions.  I have extensive experience in leading IT Technology projects/transformation initiatives."
good,Good place to work but not enough compensation given for work expected. Needs to be more communication between management and employees................
good,Company pays well. Flexible working hours. Opportunities to move around within the organization for advancement. Lots of training and resources available to employees.
good,"Live inbound, often back to back calls on AUTO - ANSWER all day. Very complex financial transactions with minimal training."
good,The company wide is constantly on continous improvements.  Sometimes forgets to get something throughly tested before implementaion.  Lots of turn over of staff.
good,High paced working environment.  Management doesn't want to help employees with the stressful environment.  But overall very flexible work hours for busy moms
good,"You will be paid competitively and the 401(K) and pension are excellent to have. On top of that, management and the team are very friendly and you can succeed if you just try hard enough."
good,"Voya is a great place to work with good benefits and good pay, has great work/life balance. I would recommend this company to anyone looking for a job in the life and annuity field"
good,"I loved working there each day.  I felt like the tools were all there to be successful.  I enjoyed the people I worked with.  The frustrating part was how unorganized the leadership structure was.  You would see people getting promoted that you knew lacked the skills and see people being let go that really contributed.   There's constant reorganization going on which makes you feel not secure.  The reorganization also doesn't really seem to make much sense, giving the impression that upper leadership doesn't have a clear direction."
good,"My employment began in 2002 when the company was called Citistreet which was acquired by ING and now Voya Financial. Since 2004, the company has suffered financially and ultimately has terminated employees every quarter since then. So with that being said, I was able to keep my employment from 2002 until the client that I serviced terminated their contract with Voya 01/31/15."
good,A typical day at Voya is very fast paced company with a host of projects and deadlines along with day to day work.  Voya allows you to experience all aspects of the business and projects. There is daily interaction with co-works within the department along with interacting with other departments and vendors.
good,"My boss, was wonderful and taught me a lot of things and coached me a lot.  Very focused on personal development, growth and process improvement."
good,I enjoyed working at Voya and may choose to work there again.  the company was well run and made improvements while I was there.  Daily huddles are a good thing.
good,"Great benefits, vacation time paid. First boss was terrible. Second was much better. Sent too many jobs overseas."
good,The company has many benefits and treats it employees well. I learned many thing like filing claims for supplemental products. My supervisors were usually very good.  I was on the phone with customers  90% on the time.
good,"A typical day at work is fast-paced and demanding.  It's challenging, but that provides an opportunity for building a bond with teammates, while sharing information and techniques for getting the work done efficiently."
good,Multiple projects with varying due dates make the day pass quickly. Engaged employees at multiple levels make the work worthwhile and customer focused.
good,Great place to work. You learn alot about the retirement world and alot about finances. The pay is pretty decent. Training was hard and you have to pass a test after 8-10 weeks of training to keep the job. But overall if you get in its worth it. Definitely can take the skills you kearn here and get a leg up in the finance world and apply what you learn to your life. Managemet is okay. There just isnt a whole lot of movement to get off the phone. You will stay on the phones with this job.
good,"Due to the nature of my job the most difficult part of working for Voya is the time commitment.  "
good,Good place to work overall. PTO is nice. Structured day and provided the tools needed for the job. Atmosphere is not stressful and easy to get a long with other employees.
good,"I was at h my desk by 6:30 - 7:00 Am.  Voya was a good place to work.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with which makes the job itself much more enjoyable and productive.. Everybody helped each other.  The hardest part of the job was that was when we needed to stop everything to complete something that came up that was very important.  For the most part, the job was good."
good,I did an internship at Voya Financial for 2 summers and 1 winter. It was a great job that gave me great work experience for my field. The culture at Voya was just not a good for me. Not having any co-workers within 10 years of my age made it difficult to relate to my peers and make friends.
good,"I worked on a six weeks project at Voya Financial Services. The work environment was fast paced and deadline driven.  I was assigned ten separate accounts with a total of twelve hundred funds to review, reconcile as per the fund accounting data bases and prepare financial statements.  I enjoyed researching variances and creating formulas to test findings.  The assignment allowed me to use advanced excel, analytics and technical skills."
good,"Great opportunity to show what you are capable of delivering, supportive leadership right up to the accessible CEO. Smaller company where employees can try different roles, however due to size it's hard to grow a career vertically."
good,Voya is a great place to work.  I believe Voya provides a culture of advancement and the opportunity to bring your full self to work. Voya provides you to work in teams and the ability to be recognized as an individual for you contributions.
good,"Great place to work, however, there is no job security. As Regional Account Manager I wore several hats and had to multi-task on a daily basis. there wasn't a lot of pleasure, but you had to make sure the information you were providing to the field was accurate."
good,"Supportive and warm atmosphere with understanding management. It is however very much a production environment with most of the day spent head down working at your desk. Continuous improvement is a big part of any role, but your reward for any improvements you design or deliver is your name on a kudos board and raised performance expectations on your next review. It is your typical corporate role."
good,All of the management team with whom I was involved were good communicators and treated me with respect. The flexible hours and company vehicle were a big plus. I did not have room for advancement in my role but I knew that going in so it was fine for me.The company has a great retirement plan with a 401K and a pension.
good,"Good people to work with, diverse, some challenges, but overall great experience.  Benefits are amazing and you are provided the opportunity to work on a number of interesting projects."

good,I really liked working with the people. Good place to learn. connected to the skyways by walking. I ride my bike to work everyday.
good,I have almost 15 years with the company. Overall I grew up here and learned a lot. My schedule was flexible and I was allowed to work from home. It wasn't always easy but I enjoyed my work family. Sad to say I'll be leaving permanently due to a layoff. The are closing the Jacksonville office.
good,"Great placed to work, management were good at coaching and I was moved up the latter quickly. Company ended up relocating team to Minot ND but staff was taken care of and provided severance."
good,Good company to work for. Upper management was good. Frontline Management was good. Cafe to get food without leaving the building. Good location. I'd go back and work there.
good,Voya offers a fast paced work environment with excellent benefits to employees.  Typical work day is 8 hours with occasional weekend late evening hours.
good,"I enjoyed my career at Voya and would have retired from there.  Voya outsourced my department."
good,Great place to work. I love the people and the culture. It is a family environment. There is room for improvement but overall is a good place to work.
good,Leading huddles. Educating co works on how to there job. Training others. Answering question from customers co workers and other partners. Answering e-mails phones and communicate to other departments on how to improve on paying claims. I learned to work well with other and be open minded to change. The work place culture was diverse and forever changing. The hardest part about this job was being looked over while others advanced. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping others.
good,Let you work at a comfortable pace as long as the work was getting done..never hounding you making you feel streessed out as long as you were productive.
good,"Company, culture and leadership are GREAT!  I value the work/life balance here the most.  However, medical benefits are the most expensive I've had in my entire professional career."
good,"Even though it was a great experience working for Voya, the turnovers with upper management and selling pieces of business is unsettling. A great company but doesn't value itself, only values the shareholders. I love the colleagues that I worked with and the culture is outstanding but didn't like the changes that affected morale."
good,"I was extremely happy here for 5 years. I had the opportunity to explore new areas of interest. While there is not much room for advancement in some departments, the company has a wonderful culture and makes its employees feel valued."
good,"Generally a very good work environment.  Well defined.  Solid procedural practices, ITIL, optimization of most job tasks when possible.  Moderate use of new technologies when appropriate."
good,"Great place to work; lack of micromanagement, and direct management worked well with employees. Great culture, but communication from the top down was often very weak. Always waiting for the ""other shoe to drop"", which it inevitably did. A slow unwinding of the division while keeping employees in the dark. Also top management hindered the ability to get promoted...often times a ""club-like"" mentality. Our department was constantly reminded that we were definitely NOT part of ""their"" club."
good,"They have good benefits.This includes generous PTO, 40 hours of volunteer time, Very good Wellness program.  There is a very nice and wonderful workout room to use."
good,Voya is a good company with good Financial Advisors that know their stuff.  In Portland all have many years of experience.  Opportunities are good.  Management & office staff are good.

good,"Very productive workplace. I enjoyed the atmosphere, the people I worked for and worked with. There was always room and opportunity for advancement. The environment was low stressed, and everyone was willing to help when and where ever needed."
good,A typical day at work would include reviewing on average 100 change records a day for completeness and accuracy.  Attending daily meetings to discuss activities and bandwidth.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the ever-changing process changes and communicating them in a timely manner.  I enjoyed interacting with everyone on my team as we all worked very well together
good,Daily I would work with great associates that was very knowledgeable in their perspective roles of the company.  Each project was challenging but enjoyable due to those I worked with directly.  Working with the management team was a great experience.  With all the amenities this company offered it was a pleasure to go to work.
good,"Amazing experience supporting my manager.  Great learning experience.  Handle extensive travel and meeting coordination."
good,"A typical day at work would include 15 minutes of opening, and taking inbound calls back to back. My manager was not too professional, and was a lack of training. Manager had innercourse at holiday party w a co-worker."
good,Very hard and very particular about the bonuses the way you earn them and qualifications for them kind of like they work against you to make sure that it is really hard for you to bonus
good,Working at Voya was a good experience overall. Sometimes management can show favoritism.. but other than that it was a Good laid back postion. Good luck
good,The work was fast paced and challenging supported by layers of management who are quick to respond to any questions or concerns.  Work/Life balance is preached and practiced
good,I was transitioned to ING from my career with Aetna Life and Casualty.  Gained a lot of data center/server room experience.  Installing hardware and loading OS software.  Plus day to day Unix administration.
good,"Voya is definitely dedicated to employee growth. After achieving a 5/5 performance rating, my manager recommended me for a position that led me into a managerial career path. My manager knew that this would result in me leaving her department, but she valued my career path above her shorter term desire for retaining high performing employees."
good,"Very busy call center job. They do pay for you to get your license which it is nice, but the pay is very low and you get constant back to back calls. Breaks are short and Average handle time is not enough."
good,I would set meeting up for the following week along with conduct meetings on a daily basis. Going out collecting data returning to my office implement it into the data base analyze the data and present it to the client.
good,"I had flexible hours, online assigned tasks daily plus reports and general office duties.  I learned about pension plans and corporate security procedures.  I always had wonderful co-workers and we all helped each other.  I had no stress on my various assignments and I was able to communicate easily with clients, management and subordinates.I found nothing particularly hard about any of my assignments."
good,A great learning experience in a financial working environment. I've learned what team work really is. The hardest part wasn't difficult; I was always having a helping hand.
good,Great company to work for. Management does not micro manage. They support a healthy work/life balance. Great coworkers. My particular role allows me to work from home.
good,I was able to work remotely for the last 12 years that I worked there which was very helpful since I moved about 50 miles away from the office.  Voya is a good place to work.
good,"I worked from home and was provided with a company car for travel to clients. Part of my job was conducting employee meetings and reviewing the retirement plan with owners, presidents, CFOs and Human Resource personnel.  This was the best part of my job."
good,"Loved the job. Management was very laid back and understanding if you had any personal issues going on. Very easy going with the only downside is the ""restructuring"" to focus on alternate sites."

good,"I was with Voya Financial during its rebranding from ING. During that time I worked with marketing teams on successful and rewarding campaigns. I do miss the job, but understand the mass lay-off that year was what was being expected from everyone in Marketing. While it lasted, they were good times."

It's a pleasure to be valued and compensated appropriately."
good,"This company is a delight to work for. This has been one of the best jobs I have ever held. The company consists of managers that are easy to relate to, as most of them started from the bottom and worked their way up through the company. One of the most positive things that you will see is that there are people that have been here for 10+years, and for a ""call center"" environment that is very impressive. The pay is quite fair for the amount of work you do, I can say that I have never ""brought my job home"" with me, so the stress levels are considerably low. The customer basis is very pleasant, there are very few issues that can cause any issues during your day. Overall, the job culture is very diverse and inclusive. I would recommend this company to just about anyone!"
good,"A great place to work, although there may be mandatory overtime.  Management was exceptional, they are really there for there teams. I would recommend Voya for anyone who is willing to put in the work."

good,"This is a good position if your willing to stay in the same position for a long time, without many raises. The people are great, and they are very flexible when it comes to your schedule."
good,"Daily assignments are challenging and interesting within an environment that is constantly changing. Improving your individual knowledge of the company operations is expected while formal learning is self paced with many internal company courses offered. While Management is largely ""hands off"", self improvement is an expectation that is fully supported. "
good,"Great work/life balance, tons of opportunity for time off whether paid or unpaid. Simple, yet professional job. Great learning experience. Management for new hires could use some improvement."
good,"I decline to answer any questions concerning the nature of the daily ongoings of this company, as I am restricted by the company contratct of employment."

good,"Enjoyed working for company for two years as a contractor.  Unfortunately departmental changes resulted in my being laid off.  "
good,"Before it was called Voya, we were known as ING. One of the best things about working for this company is helping be apart of a team that provides some of the best customer service one ever did come across. The managers were non less then excellent always made sure everyone was doing what needed to be done, never too moody or pushy. The company itself is a TEAM a word Voya takes to heart and lives by. The most enjoyable thing about Voya was taking care of people, being there for our customers, and helping them achieve a secure and financial future."
good,This experience allowed me to expand my coordinating skills as well as train several other contractors.  I worked closely with management and took over much of the re-branding duties in the department.  Were I to have the chance to work with the forms department at Voya again it would be a thrill.
good,The job was very interesting as there was always something new to do. The team was very supportive of each other and tried to help out when they could. The management would encourage its employees to learn new skills and try to open their horizons. The culture was very team oriented and everyone was welcomed.
good,You log in at your start time then log back off for 10 minutes so you can get your stats and put them on the board. Then you log on and take calls from participants in regards to their individual retirement accounts. The calls aren't normally back to back. What may be busy to other isn't busy to me. total calls for the day vary from 19-36 calls a day depending on the call volume. Calls are intense and lengthy. A typical call can be 10 minutes our longer depending on the nature of the call. Everyone is friendly and most are helpful. You can earn a quarterly bonus for good stats which is nice. You also have medical and dental insurance from day one. Another perk is the upfront PTO hours. We also get 40 paid volunteer hours as well. I love my job.
good,This is a great company to work for and the workplace culture is very pleasant. Like most call centers this company is no different from others it is numbers driven but rewards its staff with either merit raises or quarterly bonuses.

good,Do your research about the company and their values which can all be found on their website. They follow the outline provided very closely. I loved working for them
good,"As I worked there as an IT Intern, it was slow at first, but sooner or later I picked up tasks and became part of the team. The team was not only engaging but willing to teach me a new concept that can not be learned from a typical class. Awesome place to work for student growth. Now that I have changed position to an associate, the working responsibilities have increased but, it is still a place good for growth."
