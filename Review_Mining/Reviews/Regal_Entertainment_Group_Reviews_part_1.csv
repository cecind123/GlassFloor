rating,review
bad,"Only work here in you are in high school, won’t work much and won’t have a fun time. Regal won’t give proper raises nor do they care about there customers"
bad,"Priorities not in check, customer is never right, staff is rude and slow and incompetent. The general manager hides from responsibility and isn't hard enough on making sure staff does work properly."
bad,This place sucks. Everyone there doesn't care about mental health. They accuse their employees of stealing with no proof. They are under staffed and done follow child labor laws.
bad,good first job for a highschool student.lots of work because people leave big messes for you to clean up. but in the end you want to move on and not stay there
bad,"This company cares nothing about it's employees and will stop at nothing to pay you the least they can for all the work you're expected to do. It's honestly the worst. You'd think working at a movie theater is great, but I highly suggest against it."
bad,"management was garbage, need to hire new managers. Didn’t pay nearly enough an hour to pay any bills , managers don’t do their job at all they just sit somewhere on their phone. only good manager was cole."
bad,"This company was recently purchased by Cineworld, a company that has never had business operations in the U.S. before. The transition was rough and many employees who had been with Regal for many years were removed from their positions because their rate of pay was considered too high. They don’t value the employee, they see only warm bodies"
bad,"They say it's nice to get you hired, but the work place is super toxic and there is no chance of advancing unless you work there for 7+years at 8$ an hour its not worth it."
bad,"It was a horrible environment. The general manager I had was horrible he talked down to you and everyone else, he chose favorites. The other members of management weren't very different. You work crazy long hours and you get base pay and very little discounts. you get 2 movie passes a week and 10 concession discounts a week. No kind of special discount if your working either. Don't work here unless you absolutely have to."
bad,They are very racist and they do NOT care about you there. They took $100 from my paycheck and I had to FIGHT to get my money back. The management there is terrible and one girl went the WHOLE day with no break. This place needs to be under investigation.
bad,There is no communication from managers to floor staff. No manager agrees on a single way for something to get done so workers get yelled at for following instructions. Managers were biased with friends in floor staff giving them days off immediately and refusing to let others have days off. Managers let the moral of floor staff drop so bad only about 5-6 out of 40 care. Went from a staff of 80 dropped to 30 in 4 months. Horribleace to work.
bad,"Horrible place to work, @mgm regal, they cut hours all the time because we were not busy, it’s wrong and stressful. I never had a job that cut hours just because it wasn’t busy."
bad,"horrible pay for the amount of work you're made to do, terrible management, i can barely pay my small bills...... just an overall horrible place to work"
bad,"team lead sexually harassing employee then gets promotion"
bad,This job doesn't treat their employees with any respect whatsoever. The hours could be long or we would send you home when you get there if it is slow
bad,"First of all, management was pure awful. While all 5 managers have their own duties, albeit not much different from regular workers, only 1 or 2 have actual power. My pay was horrendously gutted for no reason and the silence I received from their end was abyssmal. Benefits are limited and vastly different than those of any other job"
bad,"Everyone on floor staff starts at minimum wage regardless of your work experience. The hours are long, even though the work is easy. There is very little opportunity for advancement and raises."
bad,Regal cinemas treated their employees terribly when i worked there. The management team would always make sure their employees knew they were expendable and never treated employees with respect.
bad,Bathrooms and Theatres are always trashed and management sits in office unless customers demands to see them for a refund or complaint. Overpriced tickets and concessions is over-rated
bad,"I worked at regal for a year, and the managers are highly unprofessional and they have homophobic managers. I’ve had multiple managers step into my face and try to disrespect and intimidate me as a person all together this company is terrible. Regal entertainment group, cineworld. I went to watch a movie as a guest a few days after and the managers harassed me and called the sheriffs department as i was minding my own business talking to my pervious work buddies. I was banned from regal for two years for no apparent reason. The company treats their workers unfair and like slaves. They employees are not compensated for the work they do correctly. Regal entertainment Group and Everything associated with it is all around terrible."
bad,Unless you are chummy with the management don't expect to be promoted with this company.  If you treat people and your employees decent you are considered to be an untrainable associate.  If you don't write the staff up for ridiculous reasons then you are disciplined and terminated. This is basically a high school part time job for individuals wanting to make some money during summer.
bad,It felt like weekly young teens coming in and disrupting the movie goers. One weekend I had gotten spit on by a customer as well as another teen tried to jump a fellow employee all in the same night.
bad,"Nothing good about working for Regal.  Nothing fair about this company.  Management is poor.  The 50% off of concessions averages out to what you pay at any grocery store.  Regal work their employees like a slave.  Money is their focus and prices are outrageously high. "
bad,Never work here people who don’t work are treated well while people who work hard are treated poorly by management. Management don’t know how to run this business
bad,The acquisition by new ownership last year has significantly impacted employee pay and benefits.  This has changed company culture and helped lead to the departure of key employees.
bad,"Working at this regal location was a nightmare. It was so hard to get weekends off because they were understaff. The rushes were insane and the few managers could not handle the rush so they went off on the employees that has been there for the longest time. I would not work here because it is no ""part time"" job if your not a minor. But they get B*tchy if you hit 40+ which doesn't make sense if they schedule you near or over 40 per week because there always short staff. Overall, they are horrible to work with. If they don't like you, they will set you up to get you fired in a heart beat. I suggest that when you get 2 write ups just resign before you get fired to save you the trouble. They will make you do crazy things because there, just pure lazy to do it themselves, if you ask for help good luck because they don't schedule properly. It is a very stressful job, would not recommend working here."
bad,"Corporate couldn't care less about its employees or customers, it is all about making money at the expense of the staff and guest experience. Do more with less, and if a customer complains throw a free ticket at them so they come back and by more concessions. Local management tries to make it tolerable, but more often than not their hands are tied by corporate."
bad,Management was rude and one had said some rude comments to me. Calling me names and etc. but I enjoyed working with the people I had worked with. I also enjoyed being around the guests and talking to them.
bad,I worked for regal for 1 and a half years. I was supposed to be given an evaluation after 3 months that if given a good score would result in a raise. My 3 month evaluation was done after 9 months. The raises get combined with minimum wage increases so my previous raise went away but I should have gotten my year evaluation soon after. After a year and a couple months my annual evaluation was not done. I had to ask the manager to do it and when they did it I was sat down with and my evaluation was reviewed and I was informed I would be receiving a raise. The raise never was put through when I checked my next paycheck. I asked management about the problem and the did not care. I signed for a raise that was months late and now I am not getting it! I am one of the most skilled employees which for me entails picking up a lot of the slack of other workers and doing a lot of hard work. It was a slap to the face for regal to treat me like this and because of the company restructuring new hires are getting paid higher than me. Regal is using me and is a horrible company STAY AWAY.
bad,the job was terrible and the managers didnt really do anything other than ask you to do things and stare at the security cameras or watch you clean. the job had you standing up all day with 30 min breaks and most of the time the managers forget to tell you you can go on break cause you werent allowed to just take one whenever even if you asked
bad,"Worked their my sophomore and senior year of highschool. After a year of working their with no time off I asked for a raise and was told no because we dont give raises, I worked upwards of 10-12hrs a day and they dont give raises. I was then made to work as a usher, concession, and box office employee but still making the same pay with no raises. The General Manager even made me clean a 10gallon garbage bag full of human urine up by taking a bucket and one by one pour it down the drain, with no help. Everyone else was allowed to say no and not do it but I was forced to. The management had cameras but didnt pay any attention the some of the employees stealing items that guest had left behind. I saw an employee steal a credit card, a social, and about $200 in cash and then throw the wallet away. Their was an employee who got into a screaming and swearing match with a guest and he was just told to go back to work and the guest was barred from coming back. All of that was over a misunderstanding at the concessions counter."
bad,fun for a while. stay out of drama. free movies. you'll make good friends. time goes by fast for the most part. don't work here unless you have to. don't stay.
bad,"it was bad. bad pay bad mangers, stressful work environment high prices. it was the worst first job ever but I've heard its way better now so we can only hope lol"
bad,"Frankly, I have no idea why I ever started working at Chuck E. Cheese's in the first place. I spent 15 months of my life in this dump and what do I have to show for it? Post-traumatic stress disorder and MRSA from a skeeball machine. The first time I had to step into that dreaded mouse costume is perhaps the most horrific experience of my life. I deserve better than this place. I'm a 26-year-old with a master's degree in mortuary science, yet I've been reduced to an unspeakably horrific human-mouse hybrid who's forced to dance for the enjoyment of snot-eating children in Minecraft t-shirts. "
bad,would recommend to a kid in high school or part time because the job is easy. Definitely not a career job. There is no employee recognition and you are treated like a number.
bad,"If you want to be treated like a slave, used, abused, and feel like this is it in life then you are at the right place. I didn't know there were such a thing as managers who cared until I left this job. Customers are horrible to you and will treat you like dirt. Management will also treat you like dirt. If you are lucky you can meet some fun coworkers but that's it."
bad,Always rush hour and never a time to just breath. I learned how to cash handle and to always be on my feet. The management was terrible and seemed like we should be afraid of our boss. Work place was always stressful and boring. Hardest part about the job was the constant hour changes and not being informed ahead of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the free movies and some of the crew.
bad,"I was treated poorly, minimum wage is the only thing you will ever be paid, you are only able to work 3 days a week. The managers do not care to create a good work environment, they treat people with little to no respect."
bad,My first cash involved job. It taught me how to use a cash register and how to make transaction with guests. Long hours and boring at times. Movie theater jobs aren’t for me!
bad,I worked for regal 7years and the HR took people side that were there for 3-6 months. They are unfair and work people too hard for little to nothing. They need to re-evaluate how they treat people.
bad,"Horrible management, very inconsiderate of requested hours. Didn’t allow overtime.  I was fired because I had a family emergency which made me leave the country,"
bad,"If still the same management very poor and childish environment. "
bad,"after taking away medical benefits and reducing hours, policy changes everyday, thousands or emails to read, employees that don't show up, general managers who hide in their office, no training for the job."
bad,i did not like working here worked very hard for 4 years and applied for multiple advancements and was always told next time but never actually got it they always made some kind of stupid excuse
bad,Not even worth a teenager working here. The pay is indecent the management will Work you to the bone they don’t care about school or life in general. They get mad if you aren’t living in the movie theatre.
bad,"I've been here for 4 and a half years too long. Treatment of management is poor, they only make $2 more than floor staff, which is minimum wage. I've never heard of a company paying management that much. Super stressful wirh guests, your GM can make or break you. Usually break, because they don't help out with anything (mine certainly doesn't)."
bad,This company does not care about the value of there Staff. We literally work continuously until the movie theatre is satisfied. The hours are not goof at all. You average about 20 hours or less. The company does nothing to appreciate the cast members or the managers. No benefits what so ever!
bad,To work at Regal is a great place for young teenagers looking for free movies and gas money. However the salary is not livable for families. I appreciate the free movies but it was a temp job.
bad,"They let everyone call out 30 to 45 mins late everyday and it makes it so you don't get out on time. Management and Associates are rude, inconsiderate, and ghetto. They're very unappreciative of any good that you do. It's a very negative work environment. Avoid working at the Regal Times Square."
bad,"I was 18 and it only paid $5.50 and it was not meant to last. had to wear a suit and management only overlooks, they seldom get involved and interact."
bad,"working at regal is good for people, KIDS, who don't have bills to pay. they barely let you make 30 hours, they want you to be able to do every position no raise."
bad,work is hard to come by as they dont like having people work full time so they have a massive staff that all work part time. managment plays favorites and there is very little chance to get any kind of promotion - also managment would often take our tips
bad,"paid biweekly"
bad,The management is very strict and they are not flexible with scheduling. They have their employees running around like animals on leashes. Not recommended workplace
bad,"I’ve worked at this location for nearly a year and it’s been pure h*ll since day one. They give awful hours and if you call on the managers “too much” for “trivial issues” such as transactions you can’t make or codes you aren’t authorized to use much less know, they will put you on the night shift. Even if you’re more productive during the day, if they find out that you like day shifts more, they’ll take day shifts away from you as a punishment. They allow employees they like to hide in the kitchen during their shifts and eat while other employees have to do double the work. They are horrible at setting break time and there have been times when I’ve worked a full 8 hour shift without even a chance to stop and have something to eat. The managers are virtually of no help because they take forever to come when you call for them and when they finally get there, they treat you like you’re a bother and like you’re stupid for not being able to do something that you’re not even authorized to do. I’m only working here because I have no other place to work but I’m trying to get out of here as soon as possible because every time I step inside the facility, I feel every ounce of joy and positivity leave my body. It’s not even worth the free movies. It’s just pure, unadulterated h*ll."
bad,"They don't give you enough working hours."
bad,"One of the worst companies to work for. I worked there for 4 years, started in high school and worked my way up. I would never recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"A typical day is usually working in concessions or ticket tearing. You can be standing there for 8 straight hours tearing tickets or serving food and cleaning."
bad,"Constant ""communication errors"" between everyone. General Manager, to Assistant Managers, and the Floor staff. Disgusting and unpleasant work environment."
bad,hated working here but i started when in high school and thought it was great. They expect a thousand things out of you yet constantly treat you as if you were a piece of garbage
bad,My hours were great but the managers were rude and had double standards. I was treated unfairly on numerous occasions and was not valued as an employee
bad,"Terrible pay. Short staffed. Too many managers, not enough employees. Overworked. Terrible, rude customers. Awful, awful, stay away. Not enough money."
bad,"Company doesn't pay employees enough. Very small raises. Angry customers due to overpriced concession. Too many managers not enough employees. "
bad,"The management was terrible and rude. Inconsistent with their discipline of employees. The hours are awful on the body, and it's like slave labor. You get in trouble for taking a drink, you have to sneak a drink at work."
bad,"Managers did not care that I had a second job, nor did they care that I had been injured and couldn't work. Would not suggest for anyone over twenty to work."
bad,"I maintained the upkeep of the theater.  I was also a ticket taker and theater checker.  Theater checker being I walk into each theater with a glow stick and make sure that everything was running smoothly and there was no disturbances.  I also handled customer complaints.  Anything from the sound being to loud, bathrooms weren't up to par, and if there was any disturbances that interfered with people's cinematic experience."
bad,"I had gotten a call for an interview for regal and was pretty stoked about it because I had heard great things about their theaters and all that and was expecting the interview to be great. I live about 15 minutes away from the theater I had the interview at so I had to drive their atleast expecting the interview to happen, I arrived and was turned away immediately and was told that my plugs were not gonna cut it and that even if they were taken out that I would not be hired or given any chance and was told that they dont accept tattoo's and piercings of any kind except for vanilla ear rings. I dont know what it is but regal needs to realize that its 2016 and that they need to stop having a conservative attitude and start trying to be a little progressive and let people be individuals and give people chances instead of judging people by appearance but thats not gonna change so anybody with plugs, tattoo's, piercings or anything that makes you feel like an individual don't waste your time and gas, I will never support regal entertainment group after being treated like I'm not normal ever again"
bad,"Management doesn't care to train staff. Dont care to discipline staff who dont do their jobs. Bad pay because regal is a cheap company. Favoritism, not good benefits. overall a bs job"
bad,"A typical day was coming into work and the schedule would always change without any ones knowledge. They were very unprofessional, and not organized. By far one of the worse jobs i have ever have."
bad,It is customer service and is good for a first job. You will probably work with teenagers and sometimes can be frustrating due to the amount of people that complain.
bad,Cashier and usher. Cleaned the theaters and bathrooms. Too late of hours. Management was not good. Work too long with no breaks.
bad,"Management was not the best. Many had issues with anger. Couldn't keep their cool"
bad,"You are treated worse than dog feces. Management berates employees and steals money, while blaming the poor associate."
bad,"Regal was a glowing opportunity for me right out of college. I was offered a management position at two different locations I had worked for and I thought the sky was the limit. But that rug quickly was yanked out from underneath me. I took the position and then the recession hit and all managers, besides the General Manager, were cut from salary to hourly and full time hours meant 35 hours or less( mostly less). "
bad,the management became more about if the younger workers liked them and would party with them then about work.
bad,"Super unprofessional, makes lower staff members accomplish the manager's and upper manager's work."
bad,"The company is very misleading in its hiring practices. It is notorious for hiring individuals as temp workers, with the promise of a full time, benefit eligible position, but in reality there is little to no chance that the temp will ever achieve a truly full time position. The compensation levels at the company are on average 50% lower than similar companies, except for the higher levels of management. Company puts no emphasis on education, instead focusing advancement solely on seniority, even if those more senior people have little to no qualifications. Rampant nepotism and cronyism throughout the company make the chances of advancement even lower."
bad,Working with Regal is not that great. The upper management is very poor and there are many back stabbers in this business.
bad,"fun place to work because of other workers, but management was bad."
bad,"Typical day would be, cleaning theaters, cleaning bathrooms, taking out trash, selling concessions and cleaning them. Ushering patrons to there seats. Terrible management, corrupt business"
bad,"People assume that the popcorn is stale because it is warm rather than piping hot. We throw away the popcorn at the end of each shift. It's always fresh. The food is made in microwaves, this isn't Wolfgang Puck's Bistro. There are generally 10 minutes, not the assumed 20 of previews before a movie begins. Don't want to miss the movie? Be on time, it is not my fault you consequently were late and also did not enjoy the film. It is also not my fault that there are only two ticket sellers at the counter rather than four that would speed up the process of sales."
bad,"floor (Former Employee), Sacramento – January 9, 2013"
bad,"I worked for Regal Cinemas for 7 years. In my late high school years, this job was transformative. However, this had almost nothing to do with Regal Cinemas but more about the co-workers I had at that time. These people, after 8.5 years of being acquainted with them, are still some of my closest friends. The job was excellent for someone who was still enrolled in high school, but after those years, it quickly became a terrible job. There is nearly no advancement, no concern for employees' wants or needs, and the bureaucracy within the company was terribly overwhelming. If the recession had not hit when it did, I do not think I would have stayed as long as I did."
bad,This job had very little structure and management is almost non existent!
bad,"Not fun team mates, rude managers, lack of tact"
bad,cant really remember anything from working at this job. nor did I take away positive away.
bad,"With no budget and the looming threat of being shut down for a new theater, day to day work at the Aquia is one which involves building repair, multi-tasking and offering outstanding customer service all at once."
bad,"This job is ok for high school students who just need extra cash, and thats it.I've worked here for two years and this place just sucks. The staff is gossipy, the managers are rude and lazy with the exception of maybe two. When you first get hired they tell you that Regal has great advancement opportunities even though last year they demoted like half of the managers back to floor staff. Customers are always complaining about the prices and how corprate is just greedy, but many instances have shown me that our corporation is not greedy but simply run by a bunch of morons. This is just one example, the no outside food or drink policy. It should be simple we are a movie theater so therefore we do not allow outside food or drink. However if a customer complains enough and a floor staff employee has to get a manager the manager has to let them in, so the policy is completely pointless! If you want to give your soul away then please work here."
bad,"Unfortunately I can’t use expletives on here, so a review of this place would be lacking. The management would tease advancement to employees, making us think we had to bust our butts to get the Full time position interview. Have you ever seen seagulls fight for dropped food? If you work here prepare to be a seagull. Only one or 2 gulls will eat, the rest must continue searching."
bad,"Fear-based culture with little to no communication between departments. Anything that puts you on the radar immediately is put under a microscope. The standard is absolute perfection in every category, audits corporate audits, health audits, file audits all must be perfect in order to meet expectations. Customer satisfaction scores must always improve. At no time can they fall, or it's your fault. WE were always cleaning/organizing for another tour. The same message every time ""if ""insert big wig name"" sees the theatre in this condition, then you might want to start looking for another job."" At best you would be written up. "
bad,"Most days there's not much to do. You'll  talk with employees and upper staff casually. Management is terrible. Make tons of business decisions that hinder your job efficiency. In addition, they don't care about you as a person and if you can stay emotionally detached from your job it makes life easier. It's free money about 90% of the time, but expect incompetency from the managers."
bad,"If you’re a mediocre worker, you’ll make easy bread here, they throw all the work on the people that try anyways. You can work for 3 years and get paid the same as someone starting tomorrow"
bad,"The morale is horrible, the General Manager couldn’t care less about a single employee. He worries more about himself and how he looks to the company than anything that goes on with the employees. The management is good, except for the general manager. They constantly cut shifts so don’t expect decent hours. The job is not worth how you are treated by the GM. If you can avoid it, don’t work here."
bad,"Witnessed managers reprimanding workers in a demeaning way loudly  in front of other associates. They were often understaffed which made everyone have to work harder and faster. The pay was low and many choose to work there for the benefit of obtaining free movie tickets/ admission but every movie is not free, only certain shows are free."
bad,"it was a job, not a good job, not a bad job. It paid next to nothing for frantic hours of busy work. Not worth it in my opinion. Would not recommend for anyone with more than a HS diploma."
bad,i hated everything about it. customers are rude. management was weak. you get paid minimum wage for doing the absolute most. you basically have no life because you can not get the weekends off.
bad,The new company only cares about making money. They're very strict on payroll leaving us with little time to meet business needs while keeping up with their new cleaning standards (which are very unreasonable especially when the staff and management aren't committed to a proper cleaning regiment). None of the manager's are on the same page about any of the policies or procedures cooperate is now requiring them to follow. I felt like I could get fired at any second for something ridiculous which shouldn't be the case working at a movie theater.
bad,You can't expect much in a place where they pay 9 dollars the hour. The lack of empathy and team work makes that place miserable. There's not punishment by managers and they pick who they can write up or no.
bad,"This place is horribly run, in basically every location. Since the company was bought by new owners, they've completely turned everything upside down and made it more difficult to work there day by day. They also denied the raises of anyone who was scheduled to get one in December, due to ""restructuring"" higher up in the company. I have been denied management positions solely because my roommate also works here."
bad,Management is downright rude and awful. Everyone works hard while being barked at endlessly. The systems of working with are awful and changed to become worst quite frequently. Also taking benefits away by the month.
bad,Use to be a great place to work at. Everyone felt like a family and had a good time doing their jobs. The amount of work required at the time I started was fair for the work. 2yrs later and they added on new responsibilities to everyone making work harder. Not only did they expand responsibility’s but cut the amount of people allowed to work. So 1 person was doing the work of 2 and still getting paid bare minimum. I couldn’t do it anymore. They treat you like a slave and micro manage everything.
bad,Management does not care about you or your life. I have learned that i can do better than working for this company in my life and that this is just a job that is interfering with my career
bad,"To be honest working here was a complete waste of time as far as learning new skills is considered. I didn't apply for the job for that reason anyways. It's the usual minimum wage job that will help pay the bills for a while until you can find a better paying job. The actual people you work with usually aren't that bad, if you can deal with highschoolers. They mismanage a lot of the aspects of the business you think would be rather easy like employee service. There is also almost no opportunity for advancement unless you work there for years. No raises either. You don't even get free lunch. You do however get free movie tickets."
bad,"they make you work on days that arent scheduled, temp workers are there just to fill a void till they can hire better help. very unsafe work environment. work from sunrise to sunset just to get what Walmart employees get in an 8 hour shift per hour. Regal hires temps to work at a place thats no better than a hole in the wall."
bad,I was working here in high school while the job was easy and fun with friends. Management when I was there was unprofessional. Not a bad company to work for while in high school or college.
bad,"This place is very, very poorly run. I worked here for a little over a year. It is bogged down with lazy managers and there are not enough employees working. The managers care much more about the social aspects of their job than they do about professionalism. Therefore, unless an employee is buddies with management, they will have difficulty in getting certain days off, in getting decent training, etc. I've always been a hard worker. I was hired in a large group in which I was the last to leave, because I did my job. However, I had managers mock me and criticize me behind my back, for personal reasons that didn't have to do with how I did my job, and didn't put my job at risk. They were irresponsible and inconsiderate when working with their employees. The scheduling for example. Every now and then I would go in for a 6 hour shift and get sent home after 30 minutes, or I would work a couple hours, have an hour (unpaid) break and get sent home when I got back. The customers were unpleasant, but they were honestly the least of my worries in a typical day there. There are always some good people among the bad, but the management generally has created an awful environment. The pay was not good enough for what I had to deal with, even with free movies."
bad,"The managers are horrible and don't care about their job. The General Manager cares TOO MUCH about her job. The pay is horrid. I had an increase in pay but it stopped after a few months which is absolutely ridiculous. They promise $20 bonus if you get Employee of the Month. Guess what? I never saw that money. If you enjoy working with stuck up, childish, lazy coworkers, this place is perfect for you! Also, if you don't mind working for strict, know it all, wannabe then you'd love my boss! "
bad,"The larger multiplex buildings are incredibly stressful and the least desirable places to work I started in an older, smaller theater that allowed employees to learn all aspects of the business. Great work family type atmosphere for employees, great sense of belonging and ownership. Kept moving up to bigger and more attended theaters throughout my career, and the larger the building/attendance, the less enjoyable work became. The employees seemed to look out more for number one than the whole of the team. The higher I moved up in management, the more visible this was with the corporate attitude as well."
bad,Regal’s management skills were below satisfactory as they didn’t know how to bring customers in they brought in to many workers knowing their theater runs slower than the other cutting hours for people that have been working their before my new job for two months they only gave me 10 hours per pay check and most of the time ess
bad,"This was my first job, and I’m happy enough with it. Gave me cashier and teamwork experience. Management is awful and doesn’t care, which I don’t blame them because upper management is only interested in lining the shareholder’s pockets. Movie theaters are a dying industry and Regal is helping kill them."
bad,"This job is a joke, the managers are inconsistent in treatment of their employees and may favorited to their friends.  The pay is very low and there is very minimal opportunity to increase it.  We are constantly scheduled outside of our availability and then blamed when we can't work said shodts."
bad,They ask those of leadership to work off the clock because they can’t schedule you properly. Their is immense favoritism among leadership some are treated like trash for not knowing simple parts of their jobs as others are repeatedly given the excuse “oh they’re learning” after being shown how to do it at least 10 times and still making major mistakes
bad,This is a fantastic job to work if you’ve never had a job. But once you get a certain age you can’t work here forever not to mention the managers are very rude and they don’t care about the job at all which if you work there they will tell you that. I was happy to work here when I was 15 but at 17 plus you have to move on and move out.
bad,"You received 20 hours a week if you were lucky. The manager was prejudice and biased. He was greedy and a hypocrite. The building was out dated. The pay was minimum wage, all the supervisors seemed miserable."
bad,"Great place to work if you want to constantly be around the films and movie goers. However, as a company, they are lacking. Very little support, constant favoritism, inconsistent policy enforcement. No pay raises for anyone above ground level."
bad,"Maybe it was just my specific theater, but it was very poorly managed and many of the companies policies I did not agree with. None of the managers ever agreed with one another, one would tell you one thing then another would yell at your for it and tell you a completely different way. There was no foreseeable advancement. You made minimum wage and after one year you were given a ten cent raise. That was your only raise unless you became a manager. The idea of ""benefits"" was one free movie. Discounted candy, free popcorn of a certain size. And a free drink so long as your brought your own cup. I will say it is very fair to those in school, in working around schedules and even holding your job if you go away for college, but that is really the only true benefit to working here."
bad,Worked in the corporate office for a decade and it was a toxic culture.  Constant fighting and HR throwing out anyone that rocks the boat a little.  Only people not fired in last decade is the HR department.  Shows you who holds the control.  You are just a number and zero loyalty anywhere.
bad,the job was fun and easy required cleaning and ushering cleaning bathrooms problem was co-workers did not stop talking about politics and would shame anyone who did not agree with the compile with there worldview.
bad,"Job life balance is non existent, you’ll regularly be scheduled outside of your availability. Compensation is laughable. Advancement is possible, however if they think you won’t kiss their behinds, management won’t promote you and may even threaten to fire you on a regular basis. If they don’t fire you, they’ll undertrain you and then blame you for not knowing what they were supposed to teach you. Manament is sexist and racist."
bad,"It was a horrible place to work at especially after the company was bought out. There no benefits, low pay, and terrible management across all the regals I knew and worked for. It was unhygienic and the mangers were not only sexist but completely disrespectful and made work miserable. The only good thing was the other employees."
bad,"Regal is a great job for students in high school, they offer great hours that work around your school schedule. The only downside to working for Regal, is their management. Many of the managers take advantage, talk down to, and treat the employees with no respect, as if we are incompetent."
bad,"Once the place was reacquired, everything went downhill. For example, we were expected to clean the grease off of the popper without the necessary equipment, so I had to go and buy equipment to avoid being there for an extra hour scrubbing the bottom of a grease-covered pot with a scrubbing pad. Every day was either mind-numbingly boring, which was saved by the fact that many of the people working there were very nice, or incredibly busy. The management is also in a very bad place right now, and everyone is trying to save themselves by forcing work onto lower level employees."
bad,"Well... indeed told me that my review was too long so let me just be sweet, short, and to the point. Regal is an AWFUL company to work for. They don’t appreciate their employees not one bit. They’re trying to get all general managers to quit or fire them (which is easy when you get second and third stepped for some of the most ridiculous things, such as, a spec of dust in your building) so that deputy general managers will take the general managers positions for a FRACTION of the salary. "
bad,"when I started working for Regal it was a good place to work. This year the company was sold and the new owners cared more about the money and less about customer service, or their employees. They also came in and fired most of the higher managers. Making it a very stressful place to work."
bad,Stay as busy as possible. Task aren't difficult once you have that down packed everything just falls into place. The employees are who make the magic at this thearter I worked in. Management went from excellent to not so good very unfair and not clear with instructions. Makes the thearter a very difficult and confusing place to work when management doesn't have people or social skills and also makes harder for employees to get things done when you do not have any  kind of manager experience to begin with. But other than that it's a nice place to start off to build your character and customer service skills.
bad,workers were always on their phones and standing around doing nothing until they are told to do it. The most enjoyable part was clocking out. management was really poor
bad,"IMAX and 35mm projectionist. Tedious, stressful job. Unfullfilling. Dissatisfying job. Other associate mangers were also stressed out, angry about work conditions."
bad,no good management there the place is a disaster they're employees are abused due to always having short staff . they dont pay they're employees enough.
bad,"I have been working at a different chain for months. There was a Regal close to home so I changed jobs. I lasted a week. Between the lack of communication of management staff, spotty training and one surly coworker, I'll never ask to work for any company they own ever again"
bad,"Terrible management, terrible boss, terrible co-workers. No one was supportive or good team players, and the schedule was not flexible what-so-ever."
bad,"Your position depends on a daily basis, some days you will be in concessions, other days you will be in the box office etc. This is a great opportunity to learn how to control a crowd, become a receptionist or become a manager; however as a floor staff, you are basically guaranteed no advancement. This is a great summer job for a high school kid. Co-workers can make the worst shifts enjoyable. Nuisances of the job include but are certainly not limited to: Customers complaining about various things (most of the time, its beyond your control), and management will schedule movie times and essentially screw you from getting a break. In corporate and management's eyes, you are merely a set of hands that can be easily replaced. The only perk is that you can watch free movies. However, management will often try to find a way to prevent you from doing so."
bad,theres a pay cap which i don’t entirely know what it is but for me it was 8.08 (i got that 8 cent raise the first year the company took over) worst experience 0/10
bad,"Regal Cinemas demands that their employees do multiple jobs which all pay more than minimum wage if done independently and offer no incentives for such efforts, not even increased hours."
bad,"Regal has one of the single most toxic work environments I have yet to experience. Everybody I have spoken to there grows to hate it within two weeks. Management is poor and resembles high school cliques and if they don't like you personally, they'll find a way to push you out.  I've seen it happen multiple times."
bad,For all those that remain at Regal.   There is a better life outside this organization.   Amazing how an ownership change can take a company from the “Most admired places to work” to one of the worst places to work in one year.   What a complete dumpster fire new management is.  When a person running a major department has absolutely no years of experience in the role wow.  It is awful to see such a great company destroyed by egos and arrogance.   Literally thousands of years of talent and experience pushed out for cheap no experience work force.   For those that remain from the original company may God bless you in your future endeavors
bad,Since the company was acquired by new owners and were in full control in January this year. That’s when the dumpster fire started. You a manager guess what pay cut and demotion. Only a select few get to stay a manager the others  you get 11 or 12$. If you were a manager 15$ and a DGM you make 16$. No room for a raise unless you want to move to a different theatre. Unless a management position is available in your building. You only can get them for a position change. You expect people to switch buildings constantly to try to get more money. You could go from 10min drive to an hour or more for garbage pay. So the Gm’s chose who got the management spots. If you didn’t get one you were demoted to a Team Lead or a Key holder or possibly a cast member. As the managers with the exception of the weekend you do all the administrative duty’s. The team leads and key holders run the building. Oh say what cut are pay and expect us to do everything. I say nah the managers can still do this. Upon hearing this managers started dropping like flys. It’s still going on and they can’t  find any one to replace them. You could work as a manager in multiple buildings because of this. Oh the joy.  Your coworkers were your only saving grace before the Thanos finger-snap. I’d say this job is a hard pass.
bad,"It's an okay job for a teenager, but I would recommend something else to put you through college. There are plenty of other comparable jobs that pay better, and provide more benefits."
bad,If you can’t work much or odd hours it’s a job to consider. I recommend it even less now that it has been bought out by cineworld or whatever. The pay is minimum and the opportunity to move up is close to none but even once taking the next step with the company is still not a decent pay increase. The company does not care for its employees and sees them as disposable.
bad,"Employees are way too one-sided. If you get on someones bad side, good luck trying to get on their good side.  New positions rarely open up and if you do not have a recommendation from a manager, you will not get that position even if you think that you are the most qualified or work the most hours."
bad,"Ever since I started working at Regal, it's been slowly getting worst and worst. Some of the management don't really judge fairly and some of them don't do their job completely. They also don't take into consideration past injuries."
bad,"With the few good managers that were there it wasn't a terrible place sometimes."
bad,The managers never did anything to help. They always just sat around and watched the cameras. Priorities were not in the place that they needed to be in and a lot of the employees feel disrespected.
bad,"Regal is a relaxing place to work, however, the average employee, like at any other company, is totally undervalued.  Poor management leads to high turnover, and we are almost always short staffed because of manager incompetence."
bad,"The only upside of working here was the free movies. It pays $7.25, there is no reason why you should be working here. There are plenty of other places that pay the same or better, where you don't have to be hounded day and night about walking the halls and picking up popcorn for 12 hours a day. It's mind-numbing and soul crushing."
bad,"Regal recently updated their dress code to allow male employees one pair of earrings no bigger than a dime. Mine fit this description.  They also added a clause that reads ""No gauges or spacers allowed"" which disqualifies my piercings.  To avoid confrontation, I wear skin tone spacers to camouflage the piercings, and I asked whether they would prefer me to wear skin tone, or regular earrings, or just have open holes in my ears. They told me they would contact corporate, and then I received a call telling me they were ""taking me off the schedule until my ears heal"".  The decision had nothing to do with my work performance and the Regal management have caused me nothing but hardship in the way they handled this. I would never recommend them as an employer."
bad,Company has a lot to say about importance of mentorship/succession planning then limits staff hours so no time is available for mentorship/succession planning. Morale is in the toilet. Regional Director should not be in a leadership position but achieved his position due to nepotism. Be prepared for a ton of negative feedback and almost zero positive feedback
bad,Managers are liars and unfair people. There is CLEAR favoritism. Other than the managers it is great and fun. It is fast paced and enjoyable without certain managers
bad,if you are a teenager looking for money it’s an OK job but after that get out of it it would ruin your life especially if you are in a supervisor or management role the expectations they put up on you or out rages And you were never have any free time outside of work
bad,"I worked for regal in Binghamton for about three and a half years. The people you work with our great but the management is a mess. And the general manager is extremely racist and sexist. You either get 40 hours or 4 hours a week depending on whether the managers are out to get you or not that week. If you are not a tall white man or a short blonde white girl,I would consider a different job."
bad,Working at regal is probably the worst career choice I've ever made. It always feels like you are unable to complete everything and the the boss will write you up for not dealing with thousands of people alone.
bad,"Whenever there is a rush, the managers rush the employees to meet the demands of the customers, therefore there is not much time for the employee to be able to keep their workspace clean."
bad,"Being Senior manager I am in charge of all daily operation required to run the establishment. Such examples are: HR, Payroll, Inventory, Safety, Marketing and the list continues."
bad,"This job started off amazing and it had extremely flexible hours as well but ever since the new company came in they're making extreme changes. Not only have they changed our employee benefits from unlimited movies to only two movies a week they are also cutting our pay."
bad,I worked there for a few months hoping to be great. Apparently  because I worked two jobs I was told I lacked poise. I highly recommend to stay away form this job unless you really like free movies.
bad,"For a movie theater job it's super strict. The equipment you use is out of date and the reason management gives for why it's this way is it builds character. The only way to move up in the company is to make no mistakes one mistake and you might as well quit, write ups take 6 months to expire so if you want to move up in the company or get a .25 cent pay raise you can't take any mistakes, oh and if you make a mistake after you get the pay raise you get knocked back down and your raise is taken away. The quality of employees are the worst they'll hire almost anyone as long as you can stand an spew out their scripts you have to say to consumers so they can have a ""unique"" experience at the movies. It's only a part time job. During the summer they do the Stars of hope donation thing and if you don't get enough donations by the end of the day you can get in trouble, that's right you can get in trouble at this place for other people not wanting to give you their hard earned money. Find another place to work this place is not worth your time"
bad,I hated it.I always had to argue with the manager about my scheduling. They would change my schedule the day off and then tell me I was late. If you were scheduled to close (12 AM) that meant you weren't leaving until 3 AM.
bad,"the work environment is too stressful, never take time to fully teach employees, and hours are constantly cut especially if you work non stop because of manager discretion."
bad,"Regal is a great place to work if you're still in high school. It's a very easy job. It's not hard to find something to do or to stay busy. On a typical day it really just depends where you're scheduled what you will be doing that day. Some days I'm selling tickets, some days I'm ripping the tickets and some days I'm selling the food. "
bad,"I loved my job at first, then I found out if they are short on people for a certain position (concession) they make you go there even if that's not what you were hired for or scheduled for that day but expect you to somehow do both. Some members of management were great and very helpful, but the higher-ups and GM expect you to fix their falling apart store, that's their responsibility!"
bad,"Don't consider working here if you're not a High School student. it's not worth it."
bad,"The new corporate office at Regal is not good.  They ask way too much of their floor staff employees.  Also, all of the GM’s I’ve come in contact with (including the one at our location) have been rude in some way, they get to make the schedules so they all schedule unfairly.  While they’re working 9-5 everyday you’ll get stuck working 1-10:45 or 11:30, and even later at some locations."
bad,I love working with Regal Cinemas and I love getting discounts on food and free movies but it could be very stressful sometimes even though It’s a good starter job but I wouldn’t recommended for someone who are slow peace like me pay is good and all but working on the weekends could get very busy the management need improvement because I dealt with one of the rude ones till the point that I don’t want to come to my job
bad,"It’s really not a good job to help you survive in the world. It’s low paying and they cut hours. Also corporate is terrible."
bad,"The ever increasing prices with the ever decreasing standards of both higher up managers and employees alike created and atmosphere of absolute disgust. Nothing was ever done right and managers pushed corporate agenda with absolutely no morality. Employees are paid minimum wage to put up with the increasing complaints of customers who are never happy with the overall quality of the establishment. The prices are ridiculous compared to other theaters in the area and really only stays in competition because they have IMAX screen. The chairs are old, most of the screens are really small, there are mice crawling around your feet, the floors are consistent in being either sticky with soda or slippery with ""butter"", the men's bathrooms are alright but from what I hear the women's is horrendous. The lights stay on in the theaters now because of some policy after they started selling alcohol. The menu is disgusting frozen then fried garbage to numb the minds of the idiots that would spend $20 for a meal at a theater in the first place. They are very understaffed constantly because of corporate mandating, and people don't really put any care into what they do. Most of the people hired are either still in high school or fresh out so they really just have no respect or accountability. I know Regal was just purchased by some UK company so there is a glimmer of hope, but really any sort of corporation that cares more about money than the customer will be insufferable to deal with. privalage"
bad,"When Regal took over this theater it went down hill. They have no consideration for employees, they make sure you never work 40 full hours,sending you home early. A very stressful environment due to the lack of trust in employees capabilities to preform their job. There is no respect for job titles. Exaggeratedly demanding and overbearing. When employees go above and beyond it is never noticed."
bad,"The environment was very stressful, offered very little training. It was a seasonal job, and the management treated the part-time employees like they were temporary."
bad,"The management team is dysfunctional. Good luck trying to communicate your concerns with them, because if you're not a manager, all of your opinions and needs fall on deaf ears. I was being bullied by a manager for about a year, so when I finally came out about it, nothing was done, and the bullying, till this day, continues. Therefore, Regal Entertainment Group and I can no longer do business together in terms of employment."
bad,"only good for a first job, do not advance, there is no money in it. sure free movies are good but the insurance is awful. plus the customers are the worst part of it."
bad,"I would not recommend this to any 16 year old girl. This place is filled with older men that do not really fit well with younger girls, as myself. This place may have changed, but from my experience that is what i got out of it."
bad,"i wouldnt ever suggest anyone work for this company. The customers are rude and out of control, the daily tasks are very stressful and very unsafe. the management are all 18 year olds who play favorites daily and even when it comes to promotion. the favorites were counted off thier registers and walked around with the managers while the employees who work hard are left alone to handle the entire theater alone. the general manager would perform illegal acts such as threatening to remove our breakroom and lying about promotion. in my experience my position was elimated after signing a contract for it and even undergoing training. we would fail health inspections each month which would make the management force us to work until 4:30 in the morning when our schedule was only 3:00-11:30pm. management had to count us out of our registers before we could clock out."
bad,"This was a great place to work if going to highschool(which i was for most of it) or if going to college AND you also don't need lots of cash. But, there isn't much of a career in it. The pay was terrible, short breaks, high stress environment, but hey good movies.."
bad,"They will break you down and ask for more. No benefits to be had here unless you're upper management, though you'll be expected to work 40 oddly scheduled hours a week. Only 3 days of the year are considered holidays as far as payroll is concerned (despite being open 365/366 days a year: Christmas Day, Easter Sunday and Thanksgiving) and you'll be regularly tasked with running the entire operation by yourself without any help due to payroll cutbacks."
bad,"They require a lot of work and have high standards but don’t allocate the payroll to meet those standards. Corporate cut employee hours making customer service hard to accommodate. They went from allowing employees to see two free movies a day, to two free movies a week."
bad,"There is absolutely nothing to do unless there is a guest present. It is god awfully boring. Almost two hours of every shift is spent doing absolutely nothing, and almost the entire time if you are the ticket usher. Lots of elements are created in this job to help weste time, in fact. At the end of the night, you take dishes one by one to the washroom instead of putting them on a cart. Pay was $7.70. I got TWO write ups for buying candy on my break on my terminal, which I did not know I couldn't do because I WAS NOT TRAINED. I spent about 30 minutes with a trainer on my first day and from then on I was entirely by myself. I did not know that buying a pack of Starburst would get me one write up away from firing."
bad,"Terrible management, no chance at getting time off even when requested months in advance, extremely stressful, and the pay is not worth it and neither are the discounts."
bad,"I worked for about 5 years on and off at regal. Don't expect to get treated well as a manager or floor staff. management says they give out raises every 6 months, they don't. They hire so many people every month because of how many people quit. Management will usually forget you exist. They hire people who are in high school which is great but as you can guess everyone here is immature. In the 5 years I worked at this job I only was given a 10 cent raise. The hours are reasonable if you're in school but there is no way you could make this a living wage if you aren't in school. You used to get 1 free movie a day now management has made it only 2 in a week because ""they care about their employees"" they said. If your having a problem with a costumer or an order don't expect any managers to come help you."
bad,"Management is sloppy, theyre all young so they don't really care what theyre doing. There are only three I'd say actually care, Pay is on time, hours are usually cut and not guaranteed. Management is also biased, and pick favorites, and if you aren't one of them, just prepare to be berated. Management doesn't follow their own set rules, often come up with random ones higher ups aren't employing."
bad,"Poor management with lack of skills,"
bad,Regal is an amazing company to work for the young but it is very flawed. Policy are constantly changing from corporate and not communicated with lower tier staff accordingly. the work you do is easy but the pay is horrible and customers are very entitled.
bad,"for a first job it was pretty nice. free movies"
bad,working at the movie theatre can get busy at times and overwhelming but i loved every minute of it. only reason why i left because i needed more of a pay rate and they did not give raises.
bad,The company that bought Regal makes all theaters comply with rules that are not in the best interests of the guests. This leads all employees and management to deal with the backlash. There is not enough support or communication from corporate.
bad,Worked here in Highschool . Once you get older it’s a terrible place to work . Can’t pay your bills and management was lazy . No kind of opportunity here . $7.25 minimum wage and they don’t do raises anymore by the time i left .
bad,"Gives lots of hours, but the way it is managed is not the most efficient. Good introduction job. Expect to work late hours if over the age of eighteen."
bad,"Co-workers were fun and cool. Some managers were also cool. A couple weren't. It's like, they always have a stick up their booty. The manager is horrible at giving raises. Some have been there for three years and barely got a raise. She's not very constant about what she's doing. They always schedules you all the time & you have no life when you're working there. Plus, for the people who are closing, they don't even offer an extra pay for the closers. It's a lot harder closing then opening."
bad,"Overall the job was wonderful, from the environment to the workers. It was when the higher ups implemented nit pick rules that did nothing but harden the job when my issues began. From there we were cut wages and more importantly cut hours giving me and many others very low incentive to stay with the company."
bad,Lame place it was fun at first but all the managers are trash the pay is trash hours are trash. they scheduled you on days you weren't available and still write you up.
bad,"On the weekends friday through sunday the theater is busy, during the week not so bad. Benefits only offered to senior management and the few full time staff members. As a theater employee you do not get paid vacation time. The company has taken the profit maximization strategy which makes working for the company less desirable in the past 3 years."
bad,"REG is not the worst company to work for, but the compensation for the work expected is not par with other companies that require the same skills. As a teenager, it is not so bad. I have worked with REG since I was 16, staying there over 11 years. As a career, becoming a General Manager is the only way to possibly make money. But if you need to make a few bucks and get free passes to movies as a young adult, REG isnt so bad."
bad,I kind of like my job and kind of don’t. I have some friends but not many. I really don’t feel appreciated ams the hours are bad. I don’t leave there till 2am and have to be back there at 10am
bad,"my boss verbally harassed me and several others, drank on the job, and stole from the company but he’s still working there. he stopped giving me hours because i had to call out twice for my grandma who was dying. my general manager also hit me and shoved me and when i called him out he said i was lying. it’s a truly terrible place to work and i started going to a theater out of my way because i was tired of hearing them all complain about their miserable lives."
bad,"Regal Bella Bottega is a company I was with for nearly two and a half years. Zero pay raises, ruined benefits, and a corporate company that negates it's employees. Management at this location is horrendous, the Deputy GM was not only notorious but several HR reports were filed against here - and nothing was done about it. Constant mistreatment of staff, scheduling minors till 10PM on school nights, and an unreasonable amount of required loyalty (including the forfeit of holidays and some vacations) for a minimum wage job. Every other area around Bella Bottega pays more - along with most cases w/ Regal Entertainment. They don't pay there workers - get a job with potential."
bad,"its very demanding with long hours and the coperate beliefs the only good is that perks you get other wise than that it is not worth the stress. "
bad,Managers lack communication and respect for their employees treating the workplace like high school with childish drama. They tell you when they hire you they are willing to work around schedules but they really dont!! Very lazy unless they know they are getting a visit from corporate. By far the worst company I've worked for!! And if they just simply dont like you for no apparent reason you wont get any hours.
bad,"The company for one have reduced the 2 tickets a day we used to get 2 tickets a week. Corporate office took raises away in turn for school assignments in a way to earn raises and will only be given to people who wish to move up in the company. You will start and finish at minimum wage. Interior management is very disorganized, incompetent, and favor people heavily on favoritism. The only way too be on there good side is be a yesman and do there hands and knee cleaning for minimum wage and kids the managements butt."
bad,"Regal was a relaxed and fun environment until it was bought out by a British company called Cineworld. They took over and now every day I show up something new has happened, there is new rules or policies. Just a month ago they had a huge meeting with all the general managers. Once the GMs came back they gave us a meeting where they told all of the managers that a lot of us were losing our jobs but marketed it that ""it would help promote from within"". They said there would be half as many managers and those manager positions would be full time. They said they would no longer be providing raises unless the said employee was enrolled in the star performer program. Even then, the raises cap at 9.46 and the pay starts at minimum wage. For part-time managers like me who go to school we get bumped from part time manager making 11 an hour to floor staff making 8.46. Awful company. They also cut our free tickets we used to get every day to only two free tickets a week."
bad,"A lot of the people who work at this job are younger teenagers as I was when I worked there.  i was in high school so it seemed like a job to get money for personal things, not a career job in my opinion."
bad,"Fun job for people in high school and college. "
bad,Worst place I have ever worked absolutely horrible the management is bad the coworkers are mean for the most part the pay sucks everything about this place just sucks
bad,Unorganized work environment and not enough hours were given to work.
bad,What I Learn With This Job Make Show That Your Area Clean Around And I Know How To Operate A Cashier At The Concession Stand The Best Thing I Like About The Job That You Get Free Tickets While You Work There I Had To Leave Because I Do Not Have Enough Hours
bad,This is simply not a recommended place to work if it is under the same management that it was before I had to go. It is not somewhere i would recommend to anyone who does not know how to be patient
bad,"coworkers were grreat , job was fun . had a lot of fun and got to meet new people"
bad,"Working at regal cinema was a good starter job I started working there right after high school i learned a lot from my co-workers, it was a nice starter job!"
bad,"A typical day at work is that an employee shows up and then waits for management to figure out what it wants the employee to do. This can change from moment to moment as necessity dictates. Typically management is unaware of what it wants a specific employee to do until they arrive, at the earliest. "
bad,"As soon as I got in I had to get out. Managers are never around, no breaks, they won't give you your benefits, and always be prepared to stay overtime"
bad,Management was poor and there was never any organization and time off was almost never accepted. Managers seemed in a bad mood and rude most of the time and didnt provide a fun work place
bad,"I enjoyed working there just for the people that would come in. Just in my first year of working there I had met well over 300 people. As the years went by that number grew, I still have friends that I am close to today. I never once got a raise or promotion the four years I worked there besides a 25 cent raise the government made them give us, even though I had asked before. It was told that we would be talked to if we talked about how much we made. I had been called in once because my manager was upset at me for talking about how much each person made."
bad,"You will work yourself ragged without any acknowledgment. But you can bypass all the hard work if you brown nose upper management. You'll surely be acknowledged then. "
bad,"Most of these reviews are either outdated or inaccurate. This job was so fun at first and we were treated decently. Then all within the span of a few months, corporate decides to cut half our management (while limiting how much staff we can schedule) and decides to give the floor staff 2 tickets per week, cutting out the best benefit and the main reason some people apply to work at Regal. To top off the short staff levels every day, we are forced to do temp logs and do ridiculous things like cutting off the flaps on boxes so our district manager can sleep in peace. Corporate has made it very evident the floor staff are disposable and people are quitting left and right because of them. Managers who have been there for 20+ years down the drain and forced to be demoted or quit. Within the theatre, multiple managers are not level headed and radiate obvious favoritism. Customers abuse the workers and we get treated horribly every day. Floor staff not eligible for raises but can't accept tips -- the list goes on and on. DO NOT work at regal as long as the current corporate staff is employed. They are useless and have completely ruined the fun and the company itself. FYI, if an HR issue ever comes up, don't even bother reaching out. The HR director will ignore your email and you will try about 12 ""HR"" numbers that have no idea what they're doing."
bad,"•no opportunities to grow"
bad,Regal is one of the most cheapest employers I have ever seen. First you make just above min wage while dealing with rushes and customers. They only give you a 30 min break and a nit picky about everything. Not worth working here at all.
bad,The managers at regal are 25 or younger and they have no idea what’s going on with anything we got bought out and there are no more raises or any benefits
bad,Had no hours and when Christmas came around I was asked to work from opening to closing from the 20th to the 1rts of January and having previously having only 6 hour shifts 3 days a week randomly and them changing my part time to a seasonal job I left not wanting to work that to find out I was going to be let go and with the bad management and no training I was thinking of leaving already.
bad,"The job itself is ok. Its fast paced and the free movies are a major perk. But under the management I am under-and don't intend to be under for much longer-the job is just stressful, unappealing, advancement is made difficult and the pay is not enough to live off of. Primarily the employees are high school students and therefore don't 'need' more pay, but for employees like myself, I am still making under $8/hour after being there for nearly 3 years. Another employee has been there almost 9 years and isn't making $9/hour yet. You don't get more than 25c a YEAR in raises. Most employees don't last more than a year and a half, so we are always understaffed and management will allow us to continue to be understaffed and not hire for months on end. "
bad,"This job is great if you just need a handful of money and want to work your butt off for no compensation except some old popcorn and a free movie. You'll pick up your coworkers slack (cause there is a lot of it. ) because everyone expects the new employees to do so. They don't work with your hours, and the gm is a rumored sexist so, thats great."
bad,"I worked here for a year, felt as if the managers were out ot get me from day one . They will take out their frustations with you in youre hours.  I felt they unappreicate good works, have favorites."
bad,"I would only recommend this job to students who don't have any bills. It's an energetic place and very fast paste. Anyone in 12th grade, college or even older I wouldn't recommend the treatment will be different than young teens. Don't look forward to growing or make a huge raise. Raises are about 25 cents a year."
bad,"Management was never on one accord and pay raises that you were supposed to get at certain time you either never got, or by the time you did it was time for another one."
bad,It's a good stepping stone for the younger crowd to learn the skills they will need to advance further in the job market but beyond that it's  driven by corporate greed that watches the payroll constantly and the cuts they want us to make to the staff on busy days is a little far fetched if you ask me. It's all about the customer and not about the employee but hey it has paid the bills and im thankful for that but I feel like my skills and talents are being wasted when it's so hard to advance in the company so I must move on to where I feel like im part of a real team.
bad,Extremely poor management leads to unhappy workers. This is not a job for someone who doesn't live at home with their parents still. You can't survive on the low pay and limited hours working for Regal. Floor staff is regularly scheduled part time hours (10-20 hours per week). Only upper management gets full time work. This is done so Regal doesn't have to offer health insurance and other benefits. Not a worker friendly environment. Management demands full time availability for part time work. Employees don't get paid more for tenure or experience they are just expected to do more work for the same amount of compensation as a new hire. Constantly understaffed.
bad,It was a decent place to work when I worked there in 2015. I recently tried to get a management position there and I secured it until I realized what I was getting myself back into. The top managers weren't very cooperative with their employees
bad,"The manager was a very poor commutator, I was about to graduate high school and about 7 months before I did I tried to get time off for my senior trip to Italy that was a month long.  I had tried telling management and to see if I could get the time off.  As it got closer about 2 months from my trip I brought it up again and I was ignored. 2 weeks before I left I said to them that “I had this trip and it’s important that I go” again I was just blown off and was never able to take the time off I needed.  It always seemed to me like the managers really never cared much at all and as an employee I was treated very unfairly compared to some other team members. I got cut on a very sharp peice of rusted metal and hadn’t had a tetnous shot in over 15 years.  So I asked kindly if I could leave early to get one.    They told me no and that it was nothing. I had worked there for over 2 years and one time especially that really shines bright when I think about the regal company in bend was when a new movie had came out on a Thursday and usually it’s pretty busy around 7.  But taht night was different so they sent about 4 employees home and me and another where left. My other co worker left in the middle of a rush to go and chat with a manager about non work related stuff. After asking over radio for help I was finally able to get the rush taken care of by myself.  Another time when I was 16 and working there I was asked to clean up bodily fluids from the ground and legally someone of 18 years or older  had to clean it due to some sort of health violations. But I was told if I didn’t I"
bad,"Management is watching you on the cameras all day every day. If you slack for even a second they will call you out. No room for promotions. They consider a promotion working the ticket booth instead of the concession stand, but there is no pay increase."
bad,"I tend to work alone for about 5 hours with varying days of amount of business. The majority of people who work there are high school students and those in college. There is really no way to rise up in management and the managers play favorites to their friends while others suffer with the worst parts of the job. Those who aren't friends or ""in good"" with the managers get to leave early and get better shifts as well as better movement between the different positions offered."
bad,"Whether it's busy or dead, working at Regal can be incredibly stressful. There's too much expected and demanded of the employees, who are mostly made up of high school and college students, working part-time for minimum wage. There is little-to-no recognition of high performance, with few opportunities of advancement, and often treated as replaceable."
bad,"While I did have a good time working there for quite some time, I found that the ushers eventually became glorified janitors. We cleaned up after people who did not care about what they left behind and would often be very rude. In my first few weeks I didn't even get paid for my work because there was an issue with the direct deposit."
bad,"Job is easy enough, meant for High School students rather than college students and up. You won't get anything out of it except for the free movies bit. Can't live off of the pay and they expect you to work long hours during big movie releases (where it can be very fast paced and stress inducing especially when under staffed). Workers should get paid more during big movie releases."
bad,"Regal in general is a great company with a lot of advancement opportunity. My site, however, is riddled with problems from my general manager wanted to quit and being quite open about it to a very dangerous and risky neighborhood. Unfortunately the person put in place to lead us is a terrible procrastinator that doesn't get out schedules out until midnight or later the night before we are expected to work. The place has so much potential if only it had the right leaders."
bad,It has been over a decade since I worked for this company and I could only hope things have changed from my experience which included an extreme lack of care for the fact that I was still a minor when I worked there and in school.
bad,I worked for this company for two years. I was completing management tasks but wasn't given opportunity for advancement. I don't recommend working in a field you cannot advance in.
bad,"They tend to cut hours, some management ran poorly, sends people home and leave 1-2 people to pick up all the slack, because management sending others home early and they don't consider your personal life/children when asking for more flexible shifts."
bad,Regal Entertainment Group is a company that expects the most out of their employees but gives little incentive to get such response out of their workers. There is hardly any upward mobility and becoming full time with the company is almost impossible. People who have worked for Regal for years are overlooked for promotion and hardly any training is given to employees or new management. The hours are fairly flexible and the free movies are nice. However any kind of promotion or raise are few and far between.
bad,At this location the managers didn't value their floor staff. Managers would start drama with employees. They would also schedule past agreed hours to work per week. And closing the concessions is ridiculous. Most nights employees wouldn't get off until 1 am. The company needs to pay better for closing shifts.
bad,The management sucks they don't know how to communicate with their employees and they just like to write you up for everything at least at the location that I was at thats how it was.
bad,"you were to stay by the register at all times, you did not do any kind  customer service, you sent them to a manager no matter what they needed. I learned that I missed doing customer service."
bad,"I worked the concession stand as a supervisor. I managed 30+ employees at a time in a chaotic and busy environment. The management staff was the most difficult part of my job. They were all young and inexperienced, which made their interactions with employees and customers both limited and abrasive. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to see free movies. I learned patience in this position and how to treat customers with respect and courtesy."
bad,I loved this job because of my coworkers but the pay was awful and the management was inept and rude to employees. Good for a high school job but that's about it.
bad,A typical day at work would be making no one is sneaking into theaters or filming. Making sure theater is clean and welcoming to each guest. Manager always made sure you knew that they were the managers and you were the employee. They weren't very friendly or easy to talk to if you had any concerns with the job. They wasn't willing to work with your hours. My co-workers i worked with some were cool and nice to work with than others. Hardest part of my job was loading and unloading stock and making sure everything is there.
bad,"Worked a rotating schedule in a different department each week, which made the job more interesting"
bad,Regal has too many managers and team leads. The Team leads act like they’re better than their co workers and weren’t helpful. They all have different instructions which made it super confusing for new people to follow along. It was very hard to move up ranks and very hard to be happy while working. This job is a job you do for money. You’re not suppose to stay at this job for long.
bad,"I was there at opening for the new Warren in Midwest City as a bartender. Scheduling was absolutely crazy, the management had no possible idea how to run a bar. And I got written up after I was promised my shifts would be covered since my availability was not covered. The place was a fun envirnment but the management is some of the worst I had"
bad,"Working at a movie theater sounds exciting and maybe it is, but not this company. Regal was bought out last year and it came with a bunch of changes: two free movie tickets a week, one for you and your favorite friend; no box office. All concession and tickets transactions are done in concessions, so if a customer wants to buy a movie that’s about to start they have to wait behind the family of 5 ordering a whole meal and their tickets. This company doesn’t seem to care  much about their customers or workers. This isn’t isolated to one location, rhis is corporate policy. I wouldn’t recommend."
bad,"I will never try to work for them again. because they will not try to work things thing out for hours or days you cant be there, or have to leave early for childcare or schooling reasons."
bad,I didn’t really like the job the job itself was horrible never again could I ever work there nor recommend somebody to work there I mean if it’s your first job then yeah
bad,"The work life at Regal theater is not the best place to work. However, it is just a job for a high school kid who wants a part time job after school to stay occupied."
bad,"A typical work day at Regal includes preforming various “deep cleaning” task that are given to you via a checklist. After those duties are complete you are tasked with keeping busy just so the higher ups aren’t down your throat. Even on the most dreadfully slow days, which are about 90% of the time at my theater, management expects us to preform task that are unnecessary. I’ve learned some things about the movie theatre industry while working for Regal but it pales I’m comparison to other companies that have a lot more substance to offer. Management is the worst. The managers at my theatre are all young and don’t really care to do their job. They are there for the pay and the pay only. I’ve seen the current DEPUTY GM of my theatre blatantly lie to a customer because he didn’t want to take the time necessary to resolve the customer’s complaint. Half of the time when you ask them questions they act as if you’re bothering them by trying to gain information that will help you better preform in your role. Management doesn’t even bat an eye when there are staff that are habitually late every single shift. They pick and choose who to punish for infractions and who gets away with everything. Pettiness and childishness is congratulated at my theatre, and an example of this would include the fact that the “Senior Team Lead” IDs certain employees when they come to use their free passes on a movie but then she’ll turn around and let the ones that she likes in without IDing them at all. My last issue is the safety of the job. We as Floor Staff are constantly asked to break safety violations"
bad,"Corporate has decided to cap raises. We have a co worker who has worked at our theatre since 1971 and took a major pay cut because Regal had decided to ""reward loyalty"" but capping pay. "
bad,It was an okay company to work for. Policies change a lot and management can be unorganized. Work experience was fun for the most part. Free movies and 50% off can’t beat that.
bad,Very large company with multiple brands and stores under their umbrella. Lots of nepotism and favoritism within the management and staff. They could do better with management styles and allowing new hires to perform their jobs with no issues. All of the managers are related and so is the owner as well as HR department.
bad,Okay job for high school students but hours aren’t flexible. Any consideration for your health is non existent. I had sinusitis that cleared up in about 2 weeks but was written up and brought to my final step because I couldn’t find anyone to cover my shift despite being hospitalized.
bad,This is from several years ago so perhaps it's improved. They fired people daily. Overworked and underpaid. Part-time but still bad. This is not an enjoyable job.
bad,"Some of the slowest and most uneducated employees you will ever work with. You work hard only to have your fellow employees drag you down with straight laziness and lack of effort. This job has completely torn my social life apart but I was willing to make sacrifices to have a source of income. Managment is unreasonable, unprofessional, and incompetent. The pay is absolutely unacceptable starting at $7.75 and hour with no room for advancement. I've worked loyally to this company for 8 months and haven't seen a single bump in my pay."
bad,It was overall a stressful environment but it gained me some skills rather than none at all. I am grateful for the job but was ready to move on. I went back to college the next semester.
bad,I can not recommend others to pursue a career with this company. Generally lacking in professionalism and not at all the kind of place to value initiative or hard work. Know your worth and aim higher.
bad,Easy job to learn. A few good perks like free movies and discounts in concession. Gotta be able to deal with customers that are rude. Assistant managers are great.
bad,"On your feet for eight hours, sore feet, unforgiving customers. Maybe I'm just not cut out for on-your-feet labor. I wanted to have something more out of this job, but other positions helped me far more than Regal ever did."
bad,Just a job I worked through college. Offered late hours that accommodated my schedule. Not so flexible when it came to holiday because it was the busiest time of the year.
bad,"There was little to no opportunity for career advancement, the managers gave little-to-no effort when it came to making the experience for employees an enjoyable task. They did not care for life outside of the workplace or the difficulties it can bring, and were very strict when it came to what they would allow."
bad,"I personally never felt like I was going to advance within this company. Wanted to see what else was out there so I did and i couldn't have been happier. However, I did learn a lot about the show biz!"
bad,Regal was very stressful most of the times the managers gave no space for us to do our own thing. They wrote people up without giving warnings to others. Sometimes they didn't pay us overtime. The shifts were always long and u dealt with many rude customers
bad,"The typical day at work was to put your stuff in the break room and once it's time to clock on you clock on and do what they said to do. What I learned was to plan ahead on things and juggle school and work life. Management was okay not really good enough, most of my co-workers were rude and not very helpful. The hardest part of my job there was to have to be on my feet after 5 hours even the state law says it they didn't really follow it and not being able to hang out during the weekends cuz I worked every weekend.  The enjoyable part of the job was to create new relationships with people."
bad,"A very stressful job.  No advancement, no benefits. It seems the harder you work the less rewards you get and the more used you are. if you want to enjoy this job, work a few days a week and put little effort into it."
bad,The payment is horrible considering the amount of work that is expected. Floor staff starts off at minimum wage. Associate Managers usually make $1.50-$2.00 more than floor staff. General Managers are treated horribly and are grossly underpaid. Corporate Office and District Managers create a work environment that keeps management constantly afraid of being fired.
bad,"I loved it there when I first started, like most jobs, but then the management started harassing the employees, and bullying them. Never will I ever work for that company again."
bad,"I have worked for Regal Entertainment Group for 4 years and I just cannot work for them anymore.  It's a dead end, no-win situation.  Regal refuses to pay for Obamacare; so they do what a lot of companies are doing nowadays....cutting  hours and cancelling employees insurance benefits.  I started out as a Full-Time employee but now I'm barely getting 30 hours."
bad,"I started off really enjoying this job and the people I worked with, although the thought of working at a movie theater really scared me. I received my review, offered me a raise, never received it. I became very unsatisfied with the company. I kept bugging them and bugging them, but they never fixed it. They never allowed room for improvement and the company favored more staff than others. Very unsatisfied with my first job."
bad,Terrible corporate culture which trickled down to poor management. Great as a part time job only. No real advancement opportunities.
bad,"Some times dull with lulls in the afternoon, but the evening is rarely slow. Quickness is key above quality in all aspects."
bad,not a great job to stay at long term. Good for a summer job and a little extra money.
bad,"Management cares more about getting each penny than having happy employees. the managers stand in front of you as you help customers watching your every mistake.The best part of the job was taking to other co-workers during the tremendous downtime you have between movie sets. I learned next to nothing from this job, though."
bad,"Little appreciation for employees, unreasonable workload for specific positions with poor scheduling leading to a general unease and social gap between management and employee."
bad,"After the recent Acquisition of Regal Cinemas by Cineworld, employee morale has significantly declined and team members feel underpaid and under appreciated for the amount and types of work they are expected to perform. Loyalty means nothing to the company anymore. Their motto right now seems to revolve around the idea that if you have a problem, we can pay someone less to do the same job, we don't need you anymore. I used to love my job and enjoy coming to work every day. Now i feel threatened every time I walk in the door and hate to witness the impact this company is having on the mental and physical well being of everyone around me. I hope they figure that out before it's too late. Regal might be a great place to watch movies, but it has quickly and unfortunately turned into one of the worst places to work."
bad,"At first, working here was fun and engaging but over time you notice the flaws of this company. Favoritism is a thing apparently and if a manager doesn't like you they make it a goal to write you up for any little mistake. Advancing through the company is nearly impossible because the company itself doesn't grow. At the end of a work day, you'll always feel exhausted and overworked."
bad,"Rules enforced on a ""if I think you should know basis,"" not a ""need to know"" one. New procedures/policies enforced when management physically sees you doing that same thing ""wrong"". No formal training, ""osmosis learning"". Floor management left up to those who work on the floor, not management. Minimum Wage, not enough for the amount of work. Hired as ""Floor Staff"" but only scheduled one section of facility. Really not worth staying."
bad,"This company plays favorites with certain managers and pits employees against each other. If you're a teenager then go for it, the money you save on tickets will be worth it. If you're in your mid twenties or higher, don't bother. The theater I worked at was previously owned by Great Escape, a much better corporate structure and better company to work for."
bad,Very nice first job but there was minimal growth opportunities and the former management team was poorly collaborated. Training was easy but there were lots of blank spaces where other employees would try teach.
bad,"Corporate management in Tennessee is lazy and hasn't worked in a theater in years, and so their policy and beliefs are way out of touch and pay is horrible."
bad,This is by far one of the worst jobs I've ever had. From the management to the pay there's not many good things I can think of to say about the company. The management is horrible and expect way too much from you especially when they are paying you minimum wage but mine claimed he didn't know we made that low of a wage. You are eligible for a raise once a year though! But that is almost always 10 cents. I will say I met a lot of nice people at work but others were creepy. Anyways if you're thinking about applying do yourself a favor and don't.
bad,Management is kinda poor. No room for advancement at all. most of the workers are decent. will work with you on schedule but always under staffed or getting little to no hours.
bad,This job i more for high school students that need a part time job.The work environment was fun but on weekday nights there was rarely anyone there to service. On weekends it was busy but it came in waves.
bad,"This makes me think of theaters differently. It was fast paced and very busy but the pay was weak. Your hours were never consistant and you could never get them to work with you. Management got fired, literally all of them and for over a month we had rotating temporary managers and I could not get anyone to work with me going back to college and work hours. I had to leave and it was sad."
bad,"When you get to work you go and put your things away in the break room then go and clock in. There you will see the time sheet and find out where they placed you for the day. I learned how to deal with different types of people and how to work with my co workers to get all tasks done. Management can make your day good or make it a living nightmare. They think of themselves and their well being first believe it or not. The work place culture is great because everyone is at regal to get the job done, get paid, and live life. The hardest part of the job is at the end of your shift, you never know if you will go home early or later than the intended shift end at Regal Court Street. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with and the regulars who come all the time."
bad,"The environment is fine, but when I was there, everything was under maintenance all the time. I got benefits, but the job paid the lowest of any job I had."
bad,"If you are a student and you like movies, it's fine. The pay was minimum wage and the ""perks"" were getting to see movies for free. Advancement was based on favoritism, not merit."
bad,"If you want to make extra money and watch free movies just you and one friend this is for you. Not a place for full adults to make a living unless you work in management,n Pay is minimum wage"
bad,Management is terrible. Money is terrible. No real room for growth. Really high turn over rates. Decent job if in college but can get something more flexible. At my location the managers never seem to know what they were doing and I often had to teach them basic things.
bad,the bosses care more about getting work done and the customers then they do their staff. if you have a problem at work you need to deal with it yourself. you dont get paid much and there is low chance for advancement.
bad,"Basic minimum wage job with no competitive pay, and long hours. First of all, the rules at this location are beyond absurd. At the end of the night every single thing is inventoried. Cups, popcorn bags, food items and then each missing item must be reported. A typical day is 7 to 8 hours with an opportunity to take a 35 minute UNPAID break.  cannot have personal drinks in the box office, concession booth, or ticket counter. I find it crazy that we cannot have at least a bottle of water around, which is something I always carry with me."
bad,"if you're a teenager looking for a part-time job while going to school I say go for it. However if you are in you're 20's back away while you still can. Unless the general manager likes you you won't get very far in the industry. I put a lot into that job, worked my butt off for minimum wage, and unfair treatment."
bad,"A typical day at work: you go in and immediately have to work, even if you haven't clocked in. Co-workers were rude and lazy, and management frequently cussed one another out. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the grease burns from the popcorn machine and the company's ""customer's always right"" policies, which tend to get the worker in trouble regardless of whether they do or do not go along with the needs of the customer."
bad,"A usual day at Regal began with clocking in using both your keycard and a fingerprint scanner! Promptly after you'd pick up your walkie-talkie and and earpeice and be on your way with your shift, picking up a theater cleaning schedule on your way out of the box-office. In all not much skill was acquired as not much was required to complete the tasks laid out to an employee. The coworkers were great people, and like any place I've worked i made some new friends! One of the hardest points of this job was the stiffness of the bosses and managers. An inability to take jokes really killed a lot of morale in the workplace. All together it wasn't too terrible but certainly not something i'd seek out again."
bad,"This seems like a great job at first. The staff is mostly teenagers and the management sucks. When your staff is mostly high school students they don't understand school comes first. Example: When you turn 18 the computer says you can work until 1:45 am on school nights and the mangers don't find that to be an issue if your in high school because your an ""adult"" now"
bad,"Typical day at work is clock in, go to work"
bad,"A typical day at work is repetivite nothing is new and there's moments of miscommunications. Being at this job for as long as I have I learned to control a customer service situation better. Some of management is hard working and reliable. Most of my co-workers are hard working and reliable. The hardest part of the job I would say is the hours are inconvent, doing your hardest and not being reckonized for your efforts, and having to pull the weight of other employees and even sometimes management duties. The most enjoyable part of the job would be seeing regulars, making a customer's visit satisifing, and hosting birthday parties."
bad,"It is understandable that the decision makers realize that the majority of their employees are younger and unskilled labor; therefore, there is not much focus on quality of life and compensation. However, the demographics tend to change at the management levels, and there are more people depending on their position for a livelihood. Compensation remains low, and it is difficult to attain reasonable benefits. Even those attained are difficult to afford. There is little room for advancement without being willing to relocate. Opportunities to attain bonuses have been reduced to nothing for the average manager, and even those for general managers have become more difficult to attain."
bad,It’s a good job for a high school student but I would not recommend making it a living. The pay was pretty bad for the amount of hours I worked. The managers were also not very helpful.
bad,"Regal is a God awful company, but for the past few years I've loved working at my location because of my fellow coworkers. The GM made working there worth it, to an extent. That extent being, new hires not being competent, new managers being completely unempathetic, and never receiving even a CHANCE of getting a raise in the two years I've been there. Minimum wage only goes so far."
bad,"very dirty, very unprofessional, bad workspace. did not enjoy this job 1 bit. only thing that made this job bearable was the co workers. Stubborn higher ups makes this job even harder to work AT as they don't pour in any money to this specific location"
bad,First I don't think this is a good first job . You kind of get stuck here and not care.  The managnent is about as useless as running the air conditioner on a cold night with the window open.  They are pretty much a figure head.  Second this place should be more laid back seeing it's a leisure activity and people go to have fun and relax . I am a bit shocked at how this place operates. I expected more . They promote  children  and expect to much.  It need to b changed
bad,"I started at Regal when I was 16 ans loved everything about it, the pay was great, hours were decent, managers were fun and knew what they were doing AND we got 2 free tickets everyday. 2 years later and I dreaded going into work. All of the managers I started with quit due to being bought out by a different company. The mangers I had when left were rude, unreliable, and didn't do anything. We got 2 tickets each week and were lucky to get 2 full shifts in a week. Go to AMC."
bad,"Overcritical management, uneducated coworkers, long hours, no benefits. Was it worth it for movie tickets and a little training? Don't you want to pay more attention to your homework?"
bad,When I had gotten there in November of 2018 everything was great! Employees were able to watch two free movies a day and having a 50% discount on diner and cafe was really good! By March everything began to go bad. There were no raises and haven’t been for 5+ years according to veteran coworkers. The benefits went from 2 free tickets a day to a week and the 50% discount was uselessdue to regal raising their prices. Several shifts were discontinued such as Mints and Enforcer and several drinks were removed from the fountain stations that were customer favorites. The hours were okay if you like staying up till 12:40 every night and on some night 3:00 just standing at gate not allowed to do homework or sit.Overall Regal has gone downhill.
bad,I recommend to work at regal for a short term first job. The pay is bad for everything you have to do. You get some benefits like free movies but that's about it. People working floor staff are fun to be around but management is bad.
bad,"The only place that receives as much heavy and constant traffic as we do that still pays its workers minimum wage with no tips. During my time there they have broken many California Laws like forbidding us from accepting tips and forcing a 17-year-old to come into work before seeking medical attention for a 10-inch cut on her arm because they had had too many call-outs that day. Most of the management are good fun and decent people to work with, but they are shackled by policy to keep from really caring about their employees. Corporate constantly expects more then is possible from us, demanding that we maintain the outside facilities not owned by us and clean things like door hinges to pristine. In the last year, Corporate has been rolling back employee benefits, adding more tasks to our job titles and stripped any previously received raises from its workers in an effort to ""make it an even playing field"". They have also begun exploiting the 8 hours a day loop-hole since legally we get 35 minutes of unpaid break time they can legally schedule you to work 8 hours and 30 minutes without overtime. They have no opportunity for advancement beyond an occasional management position that only opens up is a previous manager has left the position. There is a reason my location has lost 36 employees out of the 61 total floor staff."
bad,"Overall, I enjoyed working at regal. It was decent for what it was. A small amount of money for very limited hours. "
bad,"I exceeded expectations with very little recognition. The management was unorganized and loosely followed the rules they enforced. This was just a job to all the employees, I was the most ambitious one. That is in acceptable conditions to work with and even worse environment to be a part of."
bad,"Pros: "
bad,"Co-workers were cool but for the work they'd have you do and the amount I was paid (minimum wage) was just not worth it at all. This is a high school job or a second job at best. Do not work here as your main or only job if you are trying to make enough money to live off of. You will not. They also will keep your hours under 30 for the week and if you go over or your ""average"" is too high, they will drop your hours the next week or a few weeks after to bring you back down to make up for it."
bad,"Every day the employees have to ask their co-workers what they are scheduled for to fix any mistakes done by management. Many times Regal will require you stay several hours longer than your agreed upon availability. Before I quit they kept me regularly for 3 or 4 hours later than scheduled on school nights which heavily impacted my education performance. The job as far as tasks go is fairly easy once they are explained to you, however, few people explain things to you. Whenever I was given a new task I would almost always have to learn by trial and error until it clicked or until a coworker complained and have a manager walk me through the task. But when you have a grasp on how to do everything the difficulty mostly arises when others don't cooperate, numerous showings are scheduled to drop all at once, fewer people than necessary are scheduled or if a notably popular movie is released. All of which tends to happen in the big releases. Thankfully there was always at least one employee that was decent on every sift and that made my time there bearable. If you are looking for something between jobs this isn't bad, but I would not recommend this if you intend on settling on a workplace."
bad,We opened at 10 and closed at  1:00 a.m. I was a floor associate and sometimes worked behind concession. That meant sweeping the floors. Checking theaters and serving popcorn and other food.
bad,"I have worked this job for 2 1/2 years now and i loved the job in the beginning.  I love the movie industry and the atmosphere, but with the new company expectations it is not fun anymore.  I typically work until 2-3 AM on night shifts and am expected to not necessarily asked to.  Being on salary i also do not get compensated for overtime, but am expected to work it.  I have learned a lot of valuable skills that I will carry with me to other jobs.  Management is very wishy washy and is constantly changing, but most of them are very great to work with.  The hardest part of the job is the late hours and the lack of a life you get to have outside of the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you get to work with and the perks that are included."
bad,management did not care about staff. Kept us working past hours of transportation allowed considering minority age. i was fired without warning or conversation over a misunderstanding between a team leader and site manager.
bad,"If you are a teenager or young person looking for your first job, it's a good place to be for a few months. You learn how to handle cash and interact with customers. It will make you more sociable. In terms of advancement there aren't many opportunities, and they will try to save every penny they have on employees."
bad,"employees fight each other , managers come in high, managers set employees to get jump. Its amess they promise  hours and  dont hold up they end of it"
bad,They stated it was supposed to be a fun and high paced work place.  They sucked all the life out with the employees being over worked. Health benefits are overall good but that's only if you are full time.
bad,Working at regal everything flowed kind of smoothly except for the management. The managers would not do their jobs correctly most of the time and the head manager was not nice to the employees unless you were a female. Other than that the job was alright besides the pay.
bad,"Regal 16 Cinemas was somewhat fun to work for in the beginning, but as soon as I was exposed to some of the employee's attitudes and that half the managers there were somewhat incompetent is when things started going down hill. Communication is primarily lacking there between the regal ""cast"" (they have this whole brainwashing thing that you are really the star of the show, not the actual actors or even the management team) and the managers. God forbid you ask how to do something if you haven't done it before because you would get your butt chewed out for fifteen minutes before anything productive would happen. What really bothered me though is that there was no opportunity to obtain full time work there or any health coverage or even dental at that. They had a ""reward system"" and they gave you punch cards and if you did a good job or got a compliment they you would get a hole punch in your punch card and would in time be able to redeem it for something stupid like a 16 oz. popcorn container or a tumbler. It was a joke honestly, the whole setup was ridiculous."
bad,"The general manager at the Greensboro, NC location is terrible. During my time working there multiple managers quit or transferred locations because they did not want to work with this general manager."
bad,"Good place to learn low level responsibility and accountability. Very little skill needed and abundance of applicants means no real reason to value employees. It's not ideal, but it makes sense on the company's behalf. Unlikely to ever receive a raise (I got one but it was quickly nullified by rising minimum wage). Floor manager have very little influence over the decisions of upper level management, leading to constant misevaluations of employees."
bad,"Honestly I didn’t like how the managers were, they were all very aggressive and disrespectful. I don’t know if it was because I was a minor but all of them always had some sort of attitude."
bad,Management is not sensitive to physician needs and i have a hard time finding balance between my job and personal life even though I love my patients and they love me too.
bad,When I worked it was a mess there. Managers getting arrested for stealing. Managers harassing employee's. Favoritism really. I enjoyed working there my earlier years.
bad,Management was absolutely horrible with no regards for others just the task at hand. Asking different positions to do other positions due to their lack of staffing or lack of schedule management. The job is normally fun and adversely free. However the micromanagement and distrust by your supervisors takes that away.
bad,"I loved my job, I liked working with customers, production workers, engineers.  I loved solving problems, working as a team.  "
bad,"I worked here for about a month and a half and I wouldn't say it was the worst experience but it wasn't the best. I had high hopes for working at a movie theater and I thought it would have been cool. Wrong. Management wasn't that good, to me. But I was always the person unable to work under pressure. So Friday and Saturday nights were crazy for me and I couldn't handle it as well as I should have. However, the best part of the job was the benefits and the awesome people I met."
bad,"General manager is awful, the rest is fine. If you're a minor its more fun because you dont have to clean ketals and work the stinky trash compactor. It does not pay well for ask the things you have to do. This should be a last resort job for adults."
bad,"Working taught me how to team play and manage my time. I worked with really awesome people, management made it has fun as possible and listened to needs."
bad,"I did not like working here, there were not good people in this environment it was not rewarding and little room for advancement. Long hours with mandatory short breaks. Did not enjoy working for this company and management style."
bad,"Its ok for a while, but there is zero chance of advancement and the only real benefit is free movies. Which the company deems well enough to not give raises. Best thing about the job is the flexibility of the hours, but you wont ever get more that 25 a week."
bad,"Loved the people I worked with, but the pay was terrible. I was able to every position in the theater but had received a 40 cent raise in the two years that I was there."
bad,"A typical day of work was running around trying to get everything done which would include helping with customer complaints, projectors needing to be fixed, and concession lines out the door without any help from my general manager. I learned a lot about time management skills, multi tasking, customer service, and maintenance. The co-workers were very nice, but Regal does not know how to treat their employees, so that meant the floor staff was not motivated to go above and beyond their job requirements."
bad,"The only way that I would ever recommend somebody to work at Regal would be if they just had turned 16 and needed a minimum wage job, or if I hated them. This was my first job and I left within 6 months. It had a very high turnover rate with employees, and I was the last one of the people who were there when I was hired. You can expect new employees there every other week."
bad,"A typical day at Regal was when the day was slow. While working at Regal Entertainment, I learned that there was no time to be wasted. The management was nice and so were my coworkers. The only thing hard about the job was staying passed 2 am sometimes. The most enjoyable part of the job were the tips."
bad,"Management and Co workers were cool, Was not a fan of the district manger, easy going work day, face pace environment and short staff."
bad,"no comment, did not work there for long.was only their for a few weeks, their hiring process takes long especially when you didn't have 3 references."
bad,i was a cashier and i cleaned served the food i didnt work for long beacuse it was only for the summer it was very insteristing and fun i like the free movies and the food we get everybody was fund and cool
bad,"-i got very little hours and the work was always difficult we also had to rush and work harder than usual because other workers decided not to show up"
bad,When you first start working they make you feel great and a valued member. Once i was there for a few months i quickly found out they treat you like you are just another cog in the machine. It is very hard to get recognized for the work you do unless you are friends with the managers or suck up to them. It is also very difficult to advance in the company unless you know someone.
bad,"The pay is awful, management is not always on your side or supportive, corporate office does not care about employees, do not get paid enough for what employees deal with."
bad,managers were never in sight. not many privileges were given. this was the worst work experience I could've ever .  We had short lunch breaks and few bathroom breaks
bad,This job has taught me alot about the warehousing industry.  Also has taught me where when a company grows they seem to forget about their employees and just care about what the company made and not about who was helping them make it a well ran company.
bad,"4	Operated projection/audio-visual equipment hardware and software within theatre."
bad,"The movie theater work days vary. No schedule is fixed so you have to adjust everything around their schedule. I learned adequate customer service to provide the best movie experience for our patrons. Custodial duties helped promote cleanliness within the company and to make it so our customers kept coming back. However, during my experiences management was sub par at best with the exception of a few. Upper management didn't really care what was best for the employees so they usually got the short end of the stick of benefits. The hardest part would be dealing with some very unruly customers. The most enjoyable part is making long lasting friendships.  It's a job meant for high school kids to get started in the workforce"
bad,"This was my first Job. It was great at first. Once again it was the people i worked with that made this job hard. The job itself was not hard.  I enjoyed working and interacting with the customers. I enjoyed my time there. my managers were not the most effective managers. my co workers were not the friendliest, but i stuck it out and the job lasted me two years."
bad,Strict payroll guidelines made sure that almost every weekend we had to send home scheduled staff before the busiest part of the day.
bad,"Regal wasn't the best first job to have, I didn't enjoy working there and it dirty and just a bad place. The managers were always in there offices and no where to be found."
bad,its a place that can get you by. but just forget about the employment opportunities. its all about politics.
bad,"The workplace sucks, and they treat you with no respect and they expect too much from you for the pay they are offering."
bad,Good place to work while in high school or college. After that you will feel like your wasting your life away. They treat employees like children and everything has to go through corporate which is frustrating.
bad,"I worked at two separate Regal locations for a little over a year now, and fortunately my time is coming to an end. "
bad,A lot of work for the minimal pay received. Too many management changes for the time period I was there.
bad,Will stay in a box normally by yourself answering calls and selling movie tickets. Will be encountered by the customers first so will have to answer their questions and provide great customer service and product knowledge.
bad,It sucks and I would like to quit . I am an under paid employee who works way to hard and is never appericated .
bad,It's a good job if you are young with no real responsibilities. The pay is low considering how much money the business makes. The work required is way above the pay rate.
bad,FAST PACED. great job for the highschooler or maybe college student. Poor management. I felt like I was in highschool working with the co-workers.
bad,Asked us to do things constantly that were above our paygrade. Corporate gave employees no benefits and treated the management that was trying to help floor staff very poorly. Local management was good and the job itself isn’t too bad but the corporate offices constantly go out of their way to ruin it. Daily cleaning lists are 5-10 pages long and you’re expected to complete them without adequate pay orassistance. Not a good company. Does not show interest in anyone outside of its corporate offices.
bad,Overall I loved this company.. I loved the people I worked with but when corporate showed their faces the whole job became a mess. They accuse anyone of stealing and could care less if they are wrong. So good luck. They don’t care about you or how long you work there..
bad,"Regal is as routine and mediocre as it gets. Although the type of job is fairly low skilled, the company itself kept adding and piling on responsibilities as time went on. The corporate side of the company has relatively low to none admiration for their employees let alone someone like me as a former floor staff employee for 4 years. Working and talking with the employees made it seem less dreadful as the management was fairly decent and seemed to care about myself as well. The pay is horrible being minimum wage and you don't get any type of reasonable pay raise at the end of the year as you should. You could get lucky and get a 20 cent raise. As far as the benefits side goes, when I first started with the company we got two free tickets a day. Fast forward until the beginning of 2018 and now the rule changed to two movie tickets a week. From my experience, I have worked for this company for 4 years and have only gotten a 45 cent raise in the last 4 years. One would think that adding more responsibility to a job description would yield more pay but I guess Regal rather strip us of our ""benefits"" and make more profits. The management is not too bad as some of them understand how poor the job can be. The job is not stressful but is not relaxing and easy. I learned a lot from my time as an employee and I am glad I left the company at a good time."
bad,"If you want to be micromanaged then this is the job for you! I have worked for regal for about six months in total and it makes life horrible. The managers do not care about the floor staff. They treat you like dogs. My general manager has been aggressive to me and other employees multiple times and it is never called to attention. The turnover rate is so high because of the unrealistic standards. They do not care about the environment at all either, they capitalize off all the cheap plastic products. "
bad,"Ridiculous and racist management, secret pay raises for new employees while long-term employees had the same low pay, long-term employees only get a raise of about 25 cents after a few years. They control your availability and guilt-trip you. Coworkers can be fun, but that's really it. It's a consistent job, but it just isn't worth it."
bad,GM is a joke and got that title illegally. I constantly mentioned that I wanted to learn box office but was never given the opportunity even though other managers said I should be able to. Young people (high schoolers and college freshmen) work here so super immature atmosphere.
bad,"The day wasn't too long, the management was okay, and I learned how to be more independent because it was my first job. The people I worked with were really nice."
bad,"The prices kind of set you up to get yelled at and complained to even though you have no control. The managers have a clear favoritism and they don't really support the older cast members who need money for food, gas, car payments. Some guests are nice and the free movie tickets are nice but it doesn't really balance out with the stuff people have to deal with."
bad,"This job when I was here, it kept me busy but the chance for advancement was not easily able to be accomplished. When it comes to family and job they expect you to choose job first."
bad,I've worked here for five years and only make $1 above minimum wage. The raises are basically nothing even though I get all 5's on my annual review. You get in trouble if a certain percent of your customers don't want a free rewards card or if a certain percent doesn't donate to charity (even if you ask everyone). Monthly checker's report is all the company cares about and anything below a perfect score is frowned upon. It is an easy job and will work around your school schedule but it can be mentally draining due to bad management and sucky pay increases.
bad,It's a pretty cool environment to work in and the benefits are somewhat useful but the pay is pretty terrible and hours unless you try to cover other people's shifts when available.
bad,only was called when work was needed the day started with light bulb changes then theater from there bathroom check and repair when needed then checked the outside of theater for door repair.
bad,Was alright working here. I got to save some money but the staff was sometimes rude. The management was awful they were very harsh and mean which eventually caused me to quit because they were very threatening and would reprimand me and other workers in the back office.
bad,Dirty establishment with too many managers not enough employees getting free movie tickets 2 times a day is almost worth but the headache of dealing with up to 4 separate managers on shift is not easy.
bad,Regal Entertainment does not hire good managers.  Even though I was in a management position I saw many of my fellows acting inappropriately and treating those under them with a lack of respect.  Management was also knows to be corrupt and have criminal backgrounds that were not disclosed.
bad,you do not get paid enough for the work you do. the managers are ok for the most part but if they start trusting you to do everything then they will and that means they have you do everything they did not want to
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone unless they were just starting off and desperate. Management is low-par. The majority of managers there care little about employees and more about maximizing profit. They will use and walk over you if it gets them ahead. "
bad,This was a great place to work in the first few months. There was a lot of favoritism in the workplace.There was a lot of odd behavior between amongst a manager and staff member. It felt as if I was in high school all over again as there was so much drama and gossip.
bad,"Depending on you experience and skill set, I worked every position below upper management. I learned communication skills with customers and time management. There was little opportunity for job advancement. I enjoyed my fellow co workers, was considered a friendly work place."
bad,"Regal Cinemas is a great company to work for only if you"
bad,fast pace job. demanded to up-sell and suggestive sell. if you do no get anyone to sign up for regal rewards thn you get written up. very strict with dress code. ive been written up for wearing white socks.
bad,"This is a great first part time job, or second job if you are only looking for a few extra hours. Any more than that and you realize why the managers are so miserable. You will be answering the same questions and handling the same complaints daily."
bad,"A typical day at work is deoending on the job you are scheduled. If behind concession, you must be cleaning until your shift it over. From the floors to the top of the 7 foot popper. Something that i have learned there is that just beause you do a favor for someone, doesn't me they will return the favor. Managers so favortisim by letting some employees get away with minor things such s being on the phone or dress code if you are a favorite, If you have the short end of hte stick, you are looked down on and talked about by managers. The co- workers there are like family to one aonther. Out of work, we will set plans to see each other as a group, go to the beach, dinner and movies. Nothing is hard about working there. They will give you a million this to go and expect you to do things that just ins't possible. The most enjoyable part about the job is the free movies."
bad,"It's an okay place to work while you're in high school or starting college, but if you actually need money this isn't really the place for you. The hours are good during the summer, but don't expect that many during any other season. The pay is very low compared to many other places, minimum wage, and there are no full-time options for floor staff, and hardly any for management either, and since the Affordable Care Act was announced, the company has taken a strict stance on not allowing more than an average of 29 hours a week at the end of the year, so you may have 40 hours one week, followed by 5 the next week. Hours are constantly being cut, and the buildings have the bare minumum of staffing at all times."
bad,"The hardest part of the job was lifting stock because im a girl it was prettty hard. What I love most about my job is the benefits. A typical day at work for me would be for a kid to have an accident on himself and me having to clean it up. Management would show favorittism from time to time, but they were also well mannered."
bad,"I've worked on and off at regal for a little over 2.5 years taking a year break with a different job. It definitely depends on the location. A lot of younger teens for the most part. A lot of drama because of that. The GM absolutely doesn't know how to do his job and makes the managers below him do his job for him. Never expect to get a raise unless you move up in management.  Hours are pretty flexible, its pretty much my 2 day a week pocket change job now as I work another job on the side."
bad,"Although I learned customer service skills at Regal, be prepared for long days and long nights, often dealing with rude customers. Additionally, upper-management rarely seemed to care about any pertinent issues within the theater. The main enjoyable part of the job was the free movies."
bad,"If you want to work here and have any even if it’s a small piercing they will make u chose between keeping it in or taking the job, they will not compromise, the training is terrible, what you do for mostly all training is sit in front of a computer watching pointless videos, and reading over 70 pages of a handbook."
bad,It's a very chaotic place to work. too many cooks in the kitchen! Too many people telling you to do too many different things. they also cut back on some of the benefits.
bad,Definitely a job for high schoolers. Pay is as low as they can get you at (aka very close to minimum). They only hire part time unless you're upper management.
bad,It was basically customer service. Fast paced when movies started but usually slow in the mornings. The hardest part of the job was working in concessions alone when it is busy.
bad,Somehow we are always busy but at the same time aren't allowed enough hours for all the staff we have. Lines pile up and people are often late for their movies. You receive nothing but anger from customers complaining about prices and the wait. Our benefits have been slashed and a recent corporate buyout has just made the job more difficult with time
bad,"Rude managers, improper hours and pay for my age. I was receiving 7.25 an hour, and was often made to work 5-close on Friday nights and open to close on Saturdays every weekend while still in school. Work was stressful at best."
bad,Regal doesnt care about any employees. They changed many policies without keeping the feelings of floor staff and management and customers in mind. They have pushed people out of management roles and given many pay cuts. This job doesn't pay enough and isn't worth the continuous ridiculous changes and stress. All they care about is money they no longer care about their employees or customers.
bad,"Coworkers are pretty cool people, mostly young. A good starting job but there definitely isn't enough pay for the amount of stressful work involved. 7.25 per hour with no work experience."
bad,"this was an awful place to work, no breaks were given although woking 8+ hour shifts, chef was disgusting, served food he had dropped on the floor, potwash area was horrendous same dirty bowl of water used all day, ceiling was falling through. although complained about non of this has changed and same chef still works there."
bad,"When I first Regal I have fun, but after some many years working there is just feel the road never end, and more a slave working there. The reason is it is so easy for you to get in trouble over so stupid stuff. I would recommend this job to teenager who are currently in high school just to make some extra money on the side. But, for older adults I would say work at a place like Walmart or supermarket because Regal is not a perfect place for you to work at. And the manager are very very stiff and picky about every things that you do. I am so happy I am no longer working for them ever. But, the fun part about this job was you get to meet a lot people and make new friends. The most enjoyable part was meeting and communicate with customer and knowing them very much and how much they enjoyed their movies and etc."
bad,"When I first began working for Regal Entertainment Group, this was a Private company that treated its personnel exceptionally well and provided ample opportunity for career advancement.  It also was very moral driven and knew how to properly value its personnel.  The company decided to then become publicly traded in efforts to drive a stock price to facilitate a sale, which eventually would occur.  During that time, the field personnel severely suffered in all the previously mentioned positives, as they were turned into difficult negatives.  As moral suffers, prices rise, money put into the facilities and products lessen, so to does the experience of our loyal patrons.  It has been a difficult second half of my time with the company to say the least.  I am hopeful for the merging with our new parent company, that we may instill the values that once made this company so great to work for and so enjoyed by our loyal patrons."
bad,"This is an excellent place for a seasonal job, with very flexible working hours. However, in the long term it is not so great. This place does not have many opportunities to move up. No benefits unless you like free movies."
bad,The manager's attitude  was different everyday and I never knew what I was going into. I had never had an  anxiety problem until I worked there because of how the managers would act. I hated it there and wasn't treated with any respect.
bad,"the work was ok, nothing was too hard to do or complete. you basically cleaned up theaters after every show, cleaned lobby and restrooms. The staff was ok"
bad,I mean if you are looking for a job with hours dont work at the movies. They hire a bunch of people that way they dont have to give everyone benefits and stuff. Everyone gets about 1-3 days a week and its like if it isn't busy they cut you so you almost looking at like $100-$200 every other week.
bad,"Regal Theater definitely teaches one the importance of professionalism and first impressions. It is really a fun place to work where most of the employees are easy to get along with, and down to earth. However, one cannot get enough hours at this job, nor is the pay equivalent to the laborious tasks of which they ask of an employee. You do not get any benefits unless you are a manager."
bad,"I worked at regal cinemas for 5 months or so and was very unhappy. The theatre I was working at was very old and they never paid for updates to make their employees lives easier or nicer. The theatre was old and nasty. My coworkers were ok. I hated management, I was harassed by one of the managers who was 37 while I was 19 and he would constantly ask to take me on dates. It made the workplace very uncomfortable. I hated going to work. Unfortunately I never complained to the theatre general manager. Another reason it was not fun working there is because at this theatre you had to RUN to get the customers food, drink, and whatever else they wanted and expected to UPSELL every single time you were giving a customer their order. Which was very repetitive and as soon as the customer walked up you had to ask them like three questions as soon as they walked up."
bad,"I would not recommend Regal Cinemas because you get very little opportunities for job advancements. I have worked there for four years and have had only one raise and no offers to job advancements. The management is poor. The general manager does not assist the employees with what they need. The general manager is always in his office and rarely ever comes out."
bad,Its not a horrible job but when you work there you are often overworked abd underpaid. They are not very organized and the rushes on the weekends are a killer. If you're into working hard this is a job for you.
bad,"When I worked for this company there was a lot of problems, whether or not they still exist I do not know. While the company is great about working around your school schedule, there are some schedule disadvantages. These schedule disadvantages include one obvious disadvantage such working a lot on weekends as expected with this field. The two other probably lesser known disadvantages are uncompensated on call shifts in which you are supposed to put plans on hold for them if you have this shift while not receiving any benefit to do so. The other is almost all holidays were mandatory in which you have to sign up for shifts (they are open every day of the year)."
bad,"A typical day at work is exhausting, and mind-draining. I have learned how to bite my tongue for rude customers. The managers and nice. My co-worker are, oftentimes, unprofessional. The hardest part of my day is the rush hours, which is my entire shift. The most enjoyable part, of course, is going home."
bad,They did not work with my availability and continue to schedule me after hours when it was against the law and pass my availability. The plus was that my check was barely taxed I was happy about that.
bad,It has been a descent job to carry while going to school and when I was still in high school.
bad,little pay but great experience for beginning management. late hours with no real development
bad,Great job for high school or college. Hard to move up. Benefits are minimal
bad,"The job itself was fun and easy. Mostly everyone I worked with was in college so there wasn't an awkward age gap. You stand there, rip tickets, or sell concessions. Yes, occasionally you deal with annoying people but its not too bad. Plus, unlimited free movies! That part was just as awesome as it sounded. What sucked about the job was management. The managers always acted like they had something better to do whenever you needed them, and never gave you any recognition unless you screwed up. Corporate was watching your every move. I worked there for 3 months and got written up twice, both for accidentally spilling a drink. The future of working at a movie theater is bleak and offers little to no chance for advancement. It's not too bad of a job for a high school / college student, I'd recommend something else for older people."
bad,"First off, we don't get set days. You work whenever they feel like scheduling you. And they're VERY inconsistent with how many hours they give you. I went from 30 hours one week to 12 the next."
bad,"My typical day at work is very busy. I often have to go around and do everything from selling tickets, cooking and selling food and drinks, and then start all the movies at their designated start times. I learned how to operate under high stressful situations which has given me the ability to think fast. Management is very nice and respectful of their employees. The hardest part of the job is working such extreme hours for little compensation. I really enjoy all the experience that i have gotten from this job."
bad,My experience at regal was a good learning experience and I will always remeber what it taught me.  While I enjoyed it I feel that I need to find a new career path and a better opportunity.
bad,"Regal has taught me a lot in my 2 years of working for them and its provided me with many memories to look back on. Since being bought out by a new company, the work environment has suffered immensely. I still think it is a solid job for those who are movie lovers and just need a part time job. However, upper management has proven to be a difficult position to tackle as the expectations to meet the goals created by this company are unrealistic. My building has been required by our DM to work multiple overnights to achieve these expectations which left our entire staff defeated, exhausted, and overworked for a paycheck that doesn't justify the load."
bad,"The theater is slowing down tremendously and things are becoming less and less interesting. Management is somewhat unprofessional as they treat you differently based on their mood. The hardest part of the job is probably the very long shifts. For a part time job you work no less than 6 hours a shift and depending on how busy it is you can get up to 35 hours a week. There is no moving up either, as you stay at 8.25 for over a year."
bad,"Regal was a great place to work up until March 2019. When I started last year, it was a fun and welcoming environment.. very fast paced, gained tons of experience from one position. But with the new rules enforced by corporate, its become unbearable for most of us. Closing concessions now requires a daily deep clean instead of a typical wipe down. The new  employee regulations are absolutely ridiculous. Some examples: On the Door stand, even if there are no customers in the lobby, you're not allowed to check your phone, draw or doodle, or even lean on the stand. This makes it extremely miserable considering they will schedule you on door for up to 10 hours, you just stand up straight and die inside a little. In concessions during down time, you are not allowed to have a group conversation with your coworkers.. a manager will come and tell everyone to ""disperse"". Doesn't matter if everything was cleaned / stocked, do it again. Managers are usually young and pretty chill, they can be a little pushy at times though and don't respect your personal life. Our benefits used to be 2 movies a day plus a free screening of a new movie for all employees.. now its 2 movies a week with no employee screenings. Ever since the new rules were enforced around June, The entire management has been restaffed, a new GM was recruited to succeed the former GM who's held down the fort since the location opened, Employees are dropping like flies. No, I am not blaming the GM for this, he is a great guy. I just got tired of corporate taking advantage of us.. giving more work while revoking almost all benefits."
bad,Overall it's a good place to work. You get free movies. Downside is that you have to clean the disgusting bathrooms and audoriums. The people I worked with were nice. I didn't really get along with the manager though.
bad,"The coworkers are great, but recently the job has required more and more with no compensation to the employees for extra work. The benefits have been decreasing since I began work there, and I have been passed over for advancement too many times."
bad,"Used to get 40-50hrs biweekly, that went down the drain after new management. It used to be fun and not as stressful, now they’re nitpicking every little thing you do wrong when it’s not a big deal. I’ve worked there for a year, and that was already enough. We were always understaffed when it got busy, one person on each side sometimes two and the lines be going out the door and customers be yelling at you for being too slow or asking why you keep disappearing, they don’t understand that there’s only one of you having to make food in the back and coming back for another customer to get their order. Worst thing comes is when the theater is out of something. We are always out of something, such as food boxes, one of the sodas, food items, lids, cups, bags/buckets, or candy. Constantly we have to tell customers that we are out of something and if someone not constantly popping during the rush then we’re just out of popcorn until someone starts. Managers helps a lot with rushes but sometimes too slow yet understanding cause they’re coming back and forth to get what we need and handling customers complaints. Overall, it’s a mess. It’ll get better within a year or so hopefully. 10hrs a week was nothing. They pick who they like to get 3-5 days, if you’re just a worker to them then it’s 1-3 days. So it’s rare to have 5 days to work and it would be a write up if you got 6th day."
bad,"After 4 years of employment, 2 years being a manager, the new company who bought out regal doesn’t care about us as people. The new restructuring caused the demotion of so many people across the company at the theatre level. In my own theatre 3 managers were demoted to team lead and 3 other managers were demoted to floor staff which resulted in each person getting a pay cut of $2.00 and up. They got rid of yearly raises and instilled pay caps. Looking for a new job because I’ve never felt more disrespected."
bad,"The only thing I like about working at Regal is the people I work with, otherwise it really is not that great. They are just starting to make a lot of changes some are great others are ridiculous. As a manger I feel like they are asking for a lot more now and not paying us enough to do it. At first we were getting paid for what we were doing now it’s just way more stressful and I’m only part time. Free movies and half off is the best thing about this place."
bad,"It's a good job when you are in high school, but not for someone who is in college trying to pay their bills. The hours given are either too much or not enough, no in between with it. Hate coming home smelling like popcorn everyday. Management plays favorites with the employees. I don't get appreciation from my managers anymore. Flexibility is great. I hate that we cannot express ourselves physically ( color our hair with ""unnatural colors, more than one ear piercing per ear, visible tattoos, facial piercings, ect). We always get costumers asking why we all look so plain and boring while other people my age at other job can freely express themselves. We don't get paid vacation time as part timers. I don't like closing at midnight every Saturday night and then expected to work the morning shift the following day. This whole job makes my anxiety spike every shift because of how much the job is that awful. Even my fellow coworkers always seem miserable being there. Your private life and work life are not equally balanced. The work uniforms are okay, but I prefer to wear my own clothes while working. The negative work environment has mentally drained me to the point where I cry before almost every shift."
bad,"regal had a great work culture, loved my co-workers and working with customers but overall management is very unorganized and at time made doing my job harder than it needed to be."
bad,"management was horrible, manager would mostly be drunk or had somewhat of a bad smell that smelt like alcohol or cannabis."
bad,I enjoyed working there for the first month or so. Then it started to get a little boring. The one thing I like where the employees and the managers it was a fun environment to work in. One thing i hated was that your schedule changed every week so you wouldn't know what you were doing the next week.
bad,Working there was very easy yet difficult. Dealing with managers attitudes and having to be nice even when you felt you were being treated unfairly. That’s all.
bad,A job is a job but this isn’t the place you’ll wanna be. I enjoyed it but I ended up feeling like how the managers felt... careless they don’t care employees get away with a lot of stuff
bad,This is a job if some one is desperate for money. The co workers are a lot of fun to be around but this job has poor management. They play favortism and you do a lot of work for little money.
bad,"Do not work here!!! Unless you are 15 trying to get your first job in. The work here is extensive and you do NOT get paid enough for the work the managers expect you to put in. Corporate does not care how good of a worker you are, you will not advance if you are not buddy with the managers (the GM really)"
bad,"Way too hard of work for the pay. Management knew this and generally were nice because it sucked. They all seemed to like me but talked horribly about other employees in front of me. The store manager did actually clean up puke and did not make one of us do it. If you've worked food service/retail, i'm not lying. He really did. It was a typical first job. Learn to deal with customers complaining about the prices. cleaned auditoriums and sold food"
bad,"When I first went to Regal Entertainment I was leaving a dead-end job for the possibility of advancement."
bad,This workplace was more like a social gathering. Managers where dating the employees and the whole job seemed as it was a joke. There was definitely the possibility of moving up but the compensation was not worth the responsibility.
bad,"I started working at Regal Cinemas when I was in graduate school, for some money on the side. The job was fine as part-time work, and I was mostly cleaning and selling concession items. Once I became a manager, I became more intimately involved with the management culture, and I wasn't a huge fan. "
bad,"I did enjoy my time with coworkers here—the environment “backstage” was pretty close knit throughout my time there. However, and I’m not sure if this was just in my area or generally, management was an absolute wreck."
bad,Every day cleaning was beyond monotonous and some managers were ridiculously picky over the smallest insignificant details. Bad location was the worst part probably and that's not on regal. but the amount over horrible customers that yelled at employees and trashed theaters was unbelievable. Managers usually just gave customers free tickets if they were to make a scene about anything because their bosses were obsessed with locations reviews and nothing else. So bad dynamics
bad,"For part time management, we have to work up to 35-36 hours a week so we technically are not full time to prevent us from getting benefits. New ownership is changing how the day to day operations are run."
bad,Place is really awesome to work for but they don't know how to compensate for any restaurant employees salaries. High turn over rate due to that. Must have comparable working wages.
bad,working with the gm during that time in regal rockville was good and felixable. the gm and management team was workable only one manager was a problem and he also was an issue to many manager and employees.other that manager working at regal rockville was great. it felt like working in an actually movie theater.
bad,"I guess if you spend all your time around high schoolers, you start to act like one. Almost all the managers are extremely immature, they swear at the employees and are very rude and impolite. The work environment is horrible, lots of drama, and the managers don't listen when you tell them you need time off. Even if you write a note, they don't give you the time off. It is disgusting. It's a toxic place to work."
bad,"to be honest i enjoyed working there. i met some very good people, who gave me a different outlook about working. Overall decent experience"
bad,"Managing the employees, making sure they are doing their jobs.  Counting down drawers at the end of the night or the end of the shift.  Helping employees out on the floor with customers if needed."
bad,"i liked working in the concession because it kept me busy..."
bad,this is an enjoyable job with good customers and good people to work with but the company itself doesnt treat the employees very well or they dont seem to take much pride in the up keep of their facilites.
bad,"As a manager, when doing operations duties, there is a lot of inventory management and back end cash handling to be done as well as forecasting business planning against that forecast and paperwork. It can be a great challenge."
bad,"a typical day was productive, i learned to be patience with other's, i had good relationship with my co-workers. the hardest part of my job  was the feeling of me not making a difference in other's lives. the enjoyable part of my job was getting the job done correctly."
bad,It was my second job and I was so energized and happy for the first month and a half but after that I was so worn out during the holiday break and I couldn’t handle it. And one of the managers brought me down a lot.
bad,"Lots of busy work cleaning when slow, fast paced and cramped work area when busy. Dealing with lots and lots of people in a very short time frame. All concessions workers constantly bumping into each other to get everything. Cleaning giant messes in theaters on a time crunch. Trying to work fast without mistakes. Worry about doing things absolutely perfectly. Sometimes coming in early or staying super late for intense cleaning and other extra work."
bad,"Regal began as a decent minimum wage job but after being bought by a larger company they started being stricter about everything and the list of responsibilities got longer and longer with no raise in pay. "
bad,"I worked harder than most and my work was ignored and some of the managers showed favoritism, and it was no benefits, the only good thing was the free movies"
bad,They don’t understand if your going through something they’ll tell you you can’t leave even if it’s a family emergency they’ll tell you to go back to work
bad,"When I started back in 2015, I accepted the minimum wage for the fact that I just needed a summer job to pay for college. I made plenty of friends here, floor staff and managers alike, and took advantage of free movies all week a lot. "
bad,Regal Entertainment group was the begging for me i was in the customer service role with them for 9 plus years.  Regal helped me grow and ultimately gave me the help I needed to survive in the working world.
bad,"Regal entertainment is a great place to visit but not work part time for, I was not trained for the position and was thrown into it. The hours are not consistent."
bad,My managers were awful and poorly executed leadership tasks to ensure the quality of the workload was distributed evenly. The list of priorities in tasks were also ridiculous not to mention the conflict in management I had to deal with.
bad,i learned that i had to checks bathrooms for the customers and realize their observation on the bathroom. i swiped floors to get popcorn up.. making sure the bathroom were clean to let customers use the bathroom.... take trash out if it gets full
bad,"Too much work for the amount of money received as an usher, could not complete things in time. Understaffed with managers that are 18-21 years old that lack experience and education."
bad,"This is a transient job, with high turnover and fluctuating hours. If you're working here and not of a salary position, it is because your life is just beginning or already over."
bad,There would be multiple times that managers would make the schedule on the day that states on my availibility I'm unavailable. Its then our job to switch shifts or find someone to take my shift and if not you get documented.  Poor professional skills.
bad,They hire just about anyone so it makes for a good first job. I haven't worked here in years so this might not be the best review. Most of my coworkers weren't horrible. They don't give full time hours so they don't have to give benefits though. Good luck!
bad,"Expect very much and reward very little, great starter job but that's about it. Must be very time efficient and know what you're doing at all times. My experience was not pleasant but another persons may be"
bad,In a movie theater a lot of the job revolves around making the customer happy regardless of how they treated you as a server. Handled cash regularly worked with very close supervision.
bad,Loved working for the theatre and the people in it.  However I hated working for Regal as a company.  They were always coming up with new ways to make us send people home.
bad,I am not reviewing harbour view grande 16 for a second time as it is not necessary to do so because I have already reviewed it once.  This is forcing me to do reviews when I do not want to.
bad,"As far as business is concerned, the company has the right attitude. Unfortunately, this attitude is sometimes detrimental to the well-being of the employees."
bad,It is a great first job. All your coworkers pretty much become your closes friends. The job is easy and you learn to hone in your customer service skills when dealing with movie goers.
bad,"Not a good atmosphere to work in. Very hostile, & unequal. Managers are horrible. Co-workers and customers are great, theaters are very chill until a popular movie comes out."
bad,"Stocking all areas talk with managers about the goal of our day. Working closely with co workers , dealing with hard guest."
bad,"Regal is hard work, so do not apply unless you are ready to put in work. I loved working here because I was usually always busy. The most amazing part of working here is that the employees are fun to work with."
bad,It was definitely a great experience to get an opportunity to have this job as my first job. It was always fun competing in contest.
bad,"The Job is a great job when you start working at young age.  If you are an older individual, this is not the job for you. You are over worked and under paid.  With what you will be asked to do, you would laugh first because you would think they will be joking but then time passes and they are very serious."
bad,"Working at Regal is a fun experience for first time workers. You gain good customer service skills, team work experience and experience each employment position (kitchen, box, usher,contortionist) to help you become a great flexible worker."
bad,"Not the best work environment and poor working conditions. A lot of dirt and trash to deal with each day, and a lot of time I was left to do my job alone."
bad,"Poor Management"
bad,I learned to do  several things at once learned to be patient with the employees. Have worked with a lot of employees younger than me that is just starting out in there job and remember how it was like when I was that age. I have learned a lot of computer skills and went through a lot of training as far as the computer.
bad,Easy high school job. A great first job experience easy as a clerk or food clerk 
bad,"Super easy, but their policies get stricter and stricter as time goes on. The top of the food chain does not care about their bottom employees. As long as there is someone selling tickets and popcorn, they don't really care. But free movies!"
bad,Coworkers are amazing to work with but the job itself can get tedious and annoying after a while. Each manager and floor staff have a good mindset and are fun to talk to but most of the floor staff don't help clean a lot of the time at this site.
bad,The management was great but as a company or corporation very oblivious to individual location needs as well as reduction in employee benefits after putting in a hard work at this company. Also the pay is not great for the type of job.
bad,First of all they do not pay enough. They start you at minimum wage and they pretty much keep you at that rate unless you get a good 6 month or twelve month review than you get a raise of like 50 cent. They'll start you in concessions and then they send you to others areas like box office depending on what they think fits you best. Look overall as someone who wants to work there it is pretty easy to lose your job. You get 4 write ups until they suspend and negotiate whether you can continue to work or your employment is terminated. And they can write you up pretty much for anything even for careless mistakes so be aware. You don't get reserved sick days and if you do call out because your sick you have to get a doctors note to explain your absence even if you have something like a cold. But you do get free access to the movies and half off their ridiculous prices. And they also do have a flexible work schedule. As a customers standpoint their prices are way to high when you can just go to Cinemark and get a ticket half the price of theirs. They won't let you bring food inside because they want you to pay for their over priced food. They won't let you have any extra bags because they have to keep stock of all the bags and cups. But it could be worse so it's up to you whether you want the job or not.
bad,"working here was very fun, there wasnt much of a career path here but the people and the customers made coming to work so worth it, the food was good and the enviornement was too."
bad,"long hours, long nights/weekends/holidays. sometimes working to 2am. Room for advancement with low pay."
bad,N/a  honestly just need to become stronger and we need new seats and start to make events to come together and feel like family since we’re going to work together but that’s Sawgrass Regal for you.
bad,"I genuinely enjoyed this job before the Cineworld buyout. I quickly cut my hours down to 1-2 nights a week where I had been working 3-4 days a week. Once the job changed with the new company, almost every day something new was added that we had to do. Most of the time this work was thrown on the closers who stayed much later than should be expected of them. And as you would expect, the increase in responsibilities yielded no increase in pay."
bad,"Its a typical job do what your told and thats whats meant, no need to make it drawn out. The time i worked here i enjoyed it to an extent but everyone has a different aspect."
bad,"A typical day at work would be like everyone hanging out in the kitchen instead being on register, usually leave one person on register with the line backed up. Management is bad..managers would only yell at me to get on register when I am actually doing my job when two other employees are talking away in the kitchen. I would get called out for not being on register or not doing my job, but I basically kept things stocked and full because no one else would do it or didn't know how. Ever since the general manager got in trouble by their boss so everyone cleans and talk instead being on register. Also, they took away have 2 free movies everyday which is now 2 free movies per week. Hardest part of this job is dealing with people who don't want to work and manager not caring. Enjoyable part is not having to work there anymore."
bad,"This was my first job and I loved it at first. The managers and coworkers all got along, which made work tolerable. However, I started noticing that the hard workers were not being rewarded, while the lazy workers got away with anything. That's the one thing I disliked the most. Management did not treat us fairly. They never schedule enough people on the busiest days, which made work unbelievably stressful for the rest of us. But overall, it was a great experience."
bad,"A typical day at work was really busy and to add to that managers were breathing down our necks most of the time. I did learn a great number of things like time management, diligence, and customer service. Management was poor and needed refinement. Coworkers were great but there was also a great deal of drama due to relations. Hardest part of the job was the heat, and the most enjoyable part was the free movies"
bad,"Honestly i know mostly of the other regals around us get paid more then we do, but we have the highest visitation number out of all of them it just doesn't  make any sense to me."
bad,"Regal Entertainment Group is an interesting place for people to work. We learned, well we served, greeted and smile to our costumers, well they will comeback. We all employees have free tickets, and the most important is that we have good relationship with our managers. We have one goal: moving the company forward."
bad,"it’s a great place to work , friendly staff, 10/10 would work there again if had the chance. Dhdhddhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhddhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdh"
good,I didnt like working for this company. the management were rude and always disrespectful to the people who worked for them. Alot of my co-works wanted to quite but couldent because they needed the money
good,The Grand does not allow majority of the staff to receive tips in addition to the insufficient pay we receive. I work long hours and never the same times and we very rarely sit down. No benefits are given even though we do sometimes work 40 hours a week. I have learned customer service as well as multitasking and handling tough customers. The hardest part was the managers and some coworkers but the best part was the free movies. Management is unfair and it is very obvious.
good,There were too many managers.I wasn't treated fairly at all. Employees could have been better with supporting each other. It was great for just a month.
good,"Lets talk about the management in this place. They DO NOT COMMUNICATE with each other, I would hear one thing from one management then another thing from another manager. Then the whole thing with training people, the managers don't even train people. The staff members are training them, and they are getting the same pay as them (because the manager doesn't give raises to no one)."
good,"The other employees were great the management was all over the place along with very bias towards certain races. it was a very fast pace job with many hour with very poor pay, as well as pay management"
good,"barley any hours, not flexible but it is a good place to work temporarily.One of the biggest advantages is being able to save a significant amount at the theater."
good,I learned that working at a movie theatre has its advantages and disadvantages. Sometimes managers are unorganized and mess up the schedule but overall it Is good place to work.
good,fun place to work as floor staff. flexible hours and free movies! fast paced energetic environment
good,I was Ticket Taker and I enjoyed meeting people and talking about the movies and how they enjoyed them. Hardest part of job is when a lot of people came in at once.
good,Management could use some work. A normal day there is pretty busy. The hardest part of the job would be having to deal with customers that wanted to speak to the general manager and her not wanting to talk.
good,"Regal is a movie theater that attracts many types of customers. Demographic attracts rude, impatient, and inappropriate customers. Not all are rude but it puts a damper on the mood. Managers hardly ever communicate important changes. Most Regal’s are like this. No direct communication method as there are only a couple staff meetings and managers do not even communicate via email. This job involves lots of laborious intensive work. "
good,there is nothing to say on my part. This job is not meant for people who are career minded
good,"I started working at the place when it was still north american and signature owned and they made allot of changes. regal is a good company, just not a place i would choose to work at for too long."
good,"This job okay if it’s your first job. Don’t try and make a career out of it, because you’ll get nowhere. Just saying. People here are alright. So, that’s counts, I guess."
good,They don't care about you. Everyone is replaceable to them and the HR is absolute trash and a complete joke.  If you have an issue they aren't going to help.
good,The general manager at the Summerville location was a woman full of hate and no compassion for her employees. The work required of the employees was not worth the minimum wage. I would not recommend this job to anyone.
good,"The people you worked with and met daily made this place the best. I have very fond memories from managing this cinema location, from learning to thread the projectors, still celluloid, to daily inventories, watching Lord of the Rings before it was released (policy required QA of films after all), it was a great experience."
good,"Sometimes it was boring.  Sometimes it was overwhelming.  The work environment was very restrictive.  They want you to be a robot without a personality or human needs.  The free movies are nice, though."
good,The job itself was easy and the people I worked with made it better but I was overworked as a minor getting out past 2 am on weekends and 11pm on school nights almost every day. Management was lazy and disorganized
good,"Made sure movies ran on time and smoothly, also put films together."
good,company is very cheap lack of hours management i'snt good co workers make the job comfortable also guest some time rude customers
good,"Regal is a great starter job, but as far as compensation versus work load it is definitely not the best company to work for. Job security is also not guaranteed, and the work environment could become extremely stressful. The job does provide guidelines and skills to better the employee for future careers."
good,"Dealing with thousands of customers, and managing the business."
good,"This is a company meant for teenagers. It's a hard organization to advance within, and once you've advanced, show real success in a role. It's a solid rock in its industry, but not a job you want to depend on for the long-term."
good,"They’re a very strict company. Everything needs to be perfect. Although they offer holiday pay and overtime, you end up being overworked almost every shift. But the crew makes it worth it. Almost every one is cool to talk to."
good,"This place works you, and give the teenagers no hassle and don't even work. If your loyal and honest and hardworking then I recommend you not working here."
good,"A typical day working at regal is walking in the door and seeing that we are short staffed. After clocking in the anxiety begins when you see that the employees working the shift before you have not done anything helpful to make the shift go by smoothly for you or the guests. Once you count your register and already have a line out the door, you are approached by very upset and rude guests with their whole family. This family wants 6 different icee's, fresh popcorn and 5 orders of hot food. But wait! You are the only one working concessions with a line and you have to try to be in the kitchen making food and running the front while these families are gonna be late for their movie! This causes cruel and degrading comments from the guests and upset managers because you somehow cant be in three places at once! The only thing worse than a mid day shift is a closing concessions shift. You usually start at 5pm and dont get out until 2:30-3:00am. We would be able to get out earlier but somehow even though we are always short staffed, the managers say that payroll told them we have WAY TOO MANY HOURS so you are stuck by yourself and the pre-closer was useless. You are left with 3 pages worth of tasks to finish while still helping guests. And even when you think ""That was my best closing job yet!"", a manager comes and checks your work and if they find one spec of dust or one popcorn kernel you are stuck there for another hour and then you have to mop the whole front and back of the concession stand and stock rooms. Lets just say that if you're a closer, which i did for 5 days a week"
good,"Regal Cinemas was a good first job. It's easy to get started and then come in, and with the exception of rush days and opening weekends for highly anticipated movies there is almost no stress. Would not recommend as a full time job or a job to try to make a living wage off of."
good,This is a Good job for high school students only and for people who don't have nothing else to do in life i don't recommend for college students or if you plan on having your own apartment.
good,"Working with regal I learned to finish task by a certain time while having to clean auditoriums as an usher, then getting moved up to concessions you learn to handle money as well as food and getting moved up to box office you learn the importance of first impression. Although, getting moved up into the different positions may take longer for some than others because managers only move up the people they feel are “ready”. The coworkers were super friendly and welcoming and always helped when needed, as for the managers, most were stubborn and sometimes picked favorites. Some have strict rules, depending on which location you work at."
good,Most of Regal Executive Mgmt is gone.  New owners brought in their mgmt team.  Workplace culture went from 5 stars to 1 star or less.  Would have stayed at Regal if it was not purchased by another company.
good,"Working at Regal was a vivacious and engaging job. I learned how to manage the workspace efficiently, how to make guests feel welcome, and how to work various machines that helped the movies run smoothly."
good,I hated working there. I quickly left when I found another job and haven’t went back since. I don’t think they expect you to stay long there. Management quickly replaces you.
good,I learned how to work in a fast paced environment. I also tried my best not to get mad at people. I also get heat sick easy and it gets hot in the kitchen so I took little breaks to cool off. There was only one manager who wouldn't understand or be nice it.
good,Work was good and explained well to were I knew my role was as a customer service rep. Everything was always explained and the resons why. Everyone was always fun to work with and work on a day to day bass was always smooth. No arguments and everyone really works together to get things done.
good,The company had to sell the building and this was the worst transition. They did away with everything that was great and fun. They made it an unreliable place and boring place to work.
good,"Regal Entertainment Group is a good entry level workplace for those in school or just need to make some extra money. Need to have a friendly, outgoing personality and quick on your feet to keep up. It can be slightly monotonous at times."
good,"The movies is an easy first job to work at. Some good aspects are the hours are good, especially during the summer. The pay is okay, at least when you get good amount of hours. The best part about the job is the co-workers and being able to make new friends. Being a manager is fun, at times, but sometimes I feel underappreciated for all the hard work I do. Many of us go out of our way to make up for the lack of staff but it never feels good enough."
good,I didn't like how often they change your position. Or how little they told you about each position. It was an okay experience overall. I loved how I could go see a free movie once a month.
good,like the job for the free movies but not for paying my bills. most of the coworkers are tolerable but management needs work. never has the schedules ready at the beginning of each week and then changes them without informing anyone then blames you when you don't show up for the shift. unorganized and unprofessional. I've never worked for a management team that talks down to their employees. We're just all expendables I guess.
good,I have worked in a theatre for 14 years as a manager and love it.  What I don't like is the general manager of the building who has no idea how to run a business.  She is sexist and racist and the managers have gone to HR and the district manager several times to report issues and they don't care.  The staff gets paid minimum wage which isn't enough for the long hours and having to deal with the rude customers all day. The managers aren't paid that well either enough for the fact that you can't rent an apartment alone on your salary.
good,"No boundaries between staff and management "
good,"My experience at Regal gave me good knowledge of customer service but would only recommend for a first job. Management only cares if you make their job easy, don’t expect to be trained properly, but there are few good managers who care for their employees. and if you know your job you will be asked to train others with no raise, don’t expect a promotion either, they promote based off of who the managers like more(ones that kiss up to management). No benefits except for free drinks and two free tickets a week plus 50% off concessions so it’s a good job for high schoolers which is what mostly gets hired, they do minimum work and others have to pick up their slack, so their standards are low for hiring. If you suck at your job they give you minimum hours, the better you are the more you get. Minimum pay with no tips, no real benefits and only allowed a 30 min (paid) break sucks when you spend 8+ hours on your feet. Sometimes in one position(don’t expect a chair unless you work at a better location), sometimes longer if they can’t get you off the register on busy nights. Closing sucks, Regals in Vegas have been on/off on janitors so more work could be added any night."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time at regal and the friends I gained there. The management could have treated the employees better, but not all were unfair to the workers."
good,Was demoted pay from 10.00 to 8.00 an hour. And hours were cut which was not enough to pay rent and get paid weekly. Managers were not cooperative with helping associates in need.
good,"The job is pretty easy, can be stressful and very fast paced on busy weekends. They will work with your school schedule. You must be able to stand for long periods of time."
good,Minimum wage is not enough pay for the tasks we are required to do. The customers are often rude. In addition the long lines and poor management make it difficult to enjoy working.
good,"The pitch I was given was “fun, inviting, great place to work for any one who enjoys movies” what I instead got was, a stressful work environment, not due to customers or coworkers but due to management. Atleast in my building management does not care what happens to you unless it can somehow affect them. As far as management was concerned you are simply a tool or product that they can use to avoid having to do there jobs properly."
good,"The Harbourview Grande location of Regal in Suffolk, VA  is perpetually short staffed  which leads to the few employees who are available to work more than a couple days a week being taken advantage of and overworked. A part time floor staff employee starts off making $7.25 with no benefits, but could easily end up working over 40hrs a week (with little to no backup during their shifts) if their availability allows for it. Maybe at other locations with full staff, the free movie tickets and concession discount make up for the fact that comparable jobs in the area pay more, but this location would need some serious improvements before I would recommend working here."
good,"I'm going save myself and yourself some time with this review and just keep it simple. Do yourself a favor and find a better job or position than something demeaning as working and being mistreated by a company that's being run into to the ground by it's terrible set of management and CEOs as a dictated floor staff of a few years. I don't like it. Don't ever work here, the discounts and benefits they give which are complete bs and isn't at all worth it."
good,"Working at Regal is pretty simple. None of the tasks are overly complicated and can be completed fairly easily. That being said it should be a fairly easy job to do, but it is not due to the way the theatre is run. Often times the theatre is understaffed for the jobs that are expected of the employees. This is especially true when the theatre has a huge premiere like Star Wars and the Avengers. Ths problem only becomes worse due to the fact that often times employees will not show up for their shifts as many of the employees are high schoolers and do not want to deal the responsibilities of the job. This is further exasperated by the fact that these employees are not punished in any consequential way leading to this behavior being repeated. This turns a job that should be simple into a stressful experience as more responsible employees are expected to pick up the slack. Now I have heard that it is different in other theatres, but the one I worked at was poorly managed and allowed a toxic environment for its employees."
good,a day at work was crazy at regal. my breaks were always too short and there was never enough management there to help me. I was always by myself and I was just starting out.
good,My reviews on here for me is all depending on who was my managers and fellow employees where on the night of my schedule if I had the great ones it made work fun and enjoyable of not they were very rude unworkable unproductive and unprofessional they showed lack of drive and was to much High school drama.
good,"The General Manager is amazing, but his assistant managers need more training. They can be either very controlling over coworkers or can be astray from their positions. Floor staff is very kind and almost willing to help with any situation."
good,"As long as you work hard, you will get the hours desired. Weekends and holidays are a requirement, so you must be willing to work those shifts. Customer service is first and foremost, so you must be willing to help customers and remain professional."
good,Jobs were easy but were made difficult due to being understaffed and the lack of coordination from the management. The pay was horrible for the work I had been doing.
good,"A typical work day: very stressful"
good,"A typical day at work is getting in earlier than I need to be and sitting around waiting until I can clock in to start my day, I have learned how to work a deep fryer and how to change pop, butter, and oil for a popcorn machine, some of the managers were cool but others were a little mean; the GM would not want us on our phones but he would blatantly walk around while he was texting, work culture everyone was very relaxed unless we have a lot of people coming in, the hardest part of the job was cleaning a large theater by myself and the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to watch movie for free"
good,"The management team for regal needs to be more professional"
good,"Great place to learn how to work for your first time. My co-workers are fun and you always have an exciting day. However, you get paid too little for doing so much."
good,"I set up concession  stand preparing food, together. I learned it is a lot different working with the public verses working in a school. The hardest part of the job is picking up heavy boxes. The best part of the job is meeting new people every day."
good,"I was instantly selected to work at register one. It was the busiest one. On my first day, I ran the busy cash register on Saturday in July.I learned to count change and keep smiling even when you are stressing.Management was wonderful. He went on to get promoted within the company. My coworkers were lazy and spoiled. But they were young; we were all young .The hardest part was the long lines and keeping my white oxford shirt free from dirt and soda pop. The best part was making popcorn with double salt and double oil. Tasty."
good,"very fast paced job, very fun to work at. only issue is there is no room to move up and that pay is not all that good. good for a summer job for a college student maybe but you cant live off of the salary."
good,"one of the best places you'll work at for a beginner job, has some of the nicest people but the general manager is unprofessional."
good,"the employees are not treated fair and we do all the work and do not get any type of benefits.The managers boss us around and make us do all the work, while they sit on there butts. The advantage is we got free passes but it wasn't unlimited."
good,"A good place to work if you need job experience, or a second job, but not if you are looking to it as your sole source of income."
good,"Not a good place to work. "
good,"seasonal postition"
good,"The New Roc 18 and IMAX location is not an easy place to start working at your first job. It tends to be fast past and busy, but not everyday. But there is always something there to do. They do keep on top of cleaning during the day though."
good,"the job was ok didn't really enjoy it cause there was a lot of favoritism going around but besides that I've learned to communicate with people better. My co-workers were pretty cool didn't really have a problem with anybody, but besides everything i enjoyed being able to see free movies overall the job was ok"
good,Had a part time job as an Associate manager and did not mind the work load but since its a low wage job that means your co workers are not going to take their jobs seriously which creates more problems then they are worth so if you love having to hire new people every month then this is the job for you
good,"A typical day at worked consisted of cash handling, credit verification, coupon acceptance and customer service. This fast paced job always  kept me on my toes. I learned how to work under pressure in a moment notice. I also learned how to deal with customer complaints. My management team was very organized and kept not only myself but other co-workers on track. There was not a hard task in this job. I loved helping people, working hard at a fast pace, and reaching my sales goal."
good,I didn't enjoy working for only a few hours a week. A lot of standing around and nothing to do. Only busy before and after movies started and ended.
good,"The hours are not great if you have a family"
good,"I clean daily and make sure that regal was entertaining and presentable. I sell tickets and serve food such as nachos, pop corn, hot dogs, pizza, and deliver great customer service. I help customer get the best out of their money without regal losing profit. I greet each and every customer with a smile. My managers love me because I am always punctual and always get things done without problems. At the end of my shift, I always make sure that things are clean and are stock so others can get things done without any hassle. My co-workers are very helpful and they keep me awake. The most enjoyable part of my job is to see customers come out of their movie feeling very satisfied with a smile on their face."
good,At this position we really don't get help from the higher management but the staff make due with what we are given and make the best of our situation.
good,"This company gets a C for average. Even though it is an entertainment entity, it is not anything special in terms of how they treat employees."
good,"It's a minimum wage job. I liked the fast-paced environment, but the theater I worked at was in desperate need of some new management. Overall though it was easy enough work and I actually got full-time hours, so."
good,"When I was working for Regal Cinemas, everything about the work management system was disorganized mostly. Staff wasn't always friendly"
good,"As my first job, I got my first employment experience and my first paycheck. No high skill required or the sort. Just your basic minimum wage job. Mostly completely weekend shifts except during summer months."
good,"I've worked at Regal Cinemas for 2 years and I don't ever want to go back. The coworkers there were the best part of the job. The managers were okay. "
good,Easing going place but is extremely slow and boring. Most days not a lot of people come. So your either just standing around doing nothing or you are just detail cleaning and that can get extremely tiresome
good,"I like the job and it’s a great place, but management isn’t the best. I don’t want to work at a place where I feel as if I cannot also focus on school. Managers can also be harsh and rude at times over small things. Most of us are teens and managers can’t be mad because they have other priorities; school, sports, and especially family life and any issues that come in the future. Jobs aren’t our main focus. We’re trying to graduate."
good,The company has abandoned the strict but fair environment and adopted a fear incentive that drives all employees - starting with the team lead position
good,I am a student so scheduling was difficult and most of the time I had important exams and had little to no sleep or time to study and get my work done
good,"the pay sucked for all the stuff that we did that was the managers job, scheduling was terrible always getting my shift cut. The managers can be lazy at times and not help you when you need it"
good,"The coworkers were the best part of going to work.  We had a great team environment which enabled us to give customers the very best customer service."
good,"As an usher and/or concessionaire, you will be working amongst a slew of high school students who care as much about their job as their paid: the absolute minimum. This caused a lot of slacking off and difficulty even finding colleagues when things got busy because they would often hide out to kill time until the day was done. Management was very hands-off and often times I would go entire shifts without even seeing a manager or speaking to one. The hardest part of my job was trying to keep my team on track so that we could work as a cohesive group. The most enjoyable part was getting to make people's move-going experience a good one by offering solid customer support and fast counter-service as a concessionaire."
good,Minimum wage work that isn't too demanding. Long predictable periods of time when there is significantly less to do occurs often though due to movies and showtimes combining
good,"regal was my first job, it was more of a love hate relationship when it came to working there. the perks were great but the hours were horrible, especially if you are a high school or college student and can not dedicate 100% of your life to working there then the job isn't for you."
good,A typical day at work was a lot of prep. I learned how to use a cash register. Management was fair. Hardest part of the job was closing. The enjoyable part of the job was watching free movies
good,It was at times stressful but rewarding at thy same time. I learned teamwork as well. the management was professional .The hardest part of the job was cleaning theaters in a timely fashion. The most enjoyable part was helping customers and and great breaks.
good,Working here was not as I expected the discounts on movies were great but the actual work was not worth what we were payed. It was good in the beginning but after a short period of time I stopped enjoying working there.
good,Its alright..give good customer service to our customers...and continue to do a good job and always be available to work in any area...a good company to work for.
good,"Depending on the shift work can be either extremely easy or back breaking. The pay of minimum is not worth some of the work you are scheduled to do. Some employees don’t have the work ethic and tend to slack off when doing their job, these same people act very complacent when it comes to progressing forward in the company or finding new jobs."
good,"I loved the work I did for Regal, but the corporate culture at Regal does not lend itself to collaboration.  Supervisor was combative, which led to a hostile environment."
good,"Pay is very low for a supervisory role.  GM is very indecisive and contradictory in managing floor staff and managers.  Customers are impatient and can be very rude.  Floor staff do not care about their quality of work, they only care about being paid."
good,"I worked for Regal for five years. The turn over rate was fairly high. The managers did not do their jobs correctly. Being a manager for half of my time there, I was given unfair wages which I had to take to HR. The environment was basically high school, with your older managers also spreading drama. Very unprofessional workplace that is ran by people who are not fit for the job."
good,As a former employee the hours don't always match your availability. There are some managers who care about their employees and some who dont. Advancement is minimal at best.
good,While i was working here i lot made lots of friends and found people that i would hang out with outside of work but while working the working conditions were often either super busy or super slow
good,"Boring, simple, mind numbing repetitive work. Mostly college or high school kids in a high school environment. Ripe for slacking off and getting involved in co workers business. Customers ask the same questions all day long and have the same complaints. It's kind of gross, as you'd expect in any place that serves food. Occasionally asked to do tasks that are certainly not worth the pay. But a free movie everyday is pretty cool"
good,"The work day could range from being no work at all to being extremely busy, I learned how to use my time management skills, management was childish, hardest part of the job was lack of staff."
good,"You could be there for a full shift or more, or asked not to come in for a shift 48 hours before you're scheduled. There is no consistency to the scheduling. Management tries to take into account your requests off, but corporate doesn't want to be over man hours every single pay period. Which results in there never being enough hours for all the employees who work there."
good,The manager doesn't seem to know how to talk or work with customers and/or workers. The environment can get pretty hectic but you can find money on the ground when cleaning.
good,"It is a decent job for someone who has no experience. However, it is hard to manage getting hours during the weeks or a slow period where no interesting movies have came out. More of a night job, on the week days you aren't leaving til about 12 AM and weekends 1 or 2 AM. Wouldn't recommend this job for college students."
good,"lower pay, but fun company to work for great teenager or young adult benefits. got a ton of free movie tickets, buut pay sucked, and corporate made awful rules."
good,"The work environment was okay, it wasn't great. The benefits are what kept me there for so long, you get free movies and half off concession items. The management was poor and some of the managers are not good customer service people. And you should say goodbye to your weekends. During the busy season you'll have to work all weekend and get upwards of 20 hours, but during the slow season, you'll get lucky to get 12 hours. As far as a first job goes, it was a good one, but if you have other options available, pick those ones first."
good,"You must be prepared to work past your limit. I was not given breaks and barely lunches to the point an ER visit was requested. I take great pride in any job I receive, but the management did not feel the same. They do not help you to improve or move up in rank. Even if you were sick for your very first time in say a year, they want a doctors note, they do not care if you were too weak to take yourself. The only thing that kept me there was the free movies and discounted food. If it wasn't for that, I would have left."
good,"This company is good for employees looking to work minimal hours so that they can attend school as well. Management did not really care about the employees, they were in their offices on cell phones most of the time. Coworkers were extremely friendly."
good,"First job I had, but most definitely the most time consuming. I held every position in the theater including; box office, concessions, bathroom attendant, cleaner, theater attendant, theater cleaner, closer, opener, and eventually senior cast member. It is not hard to climb the ladder with this company, but it only goes so far and still pays horribly. I worked dillegently and went home at 2am each night with popcorn burns, covered in butter, bruises, and woke up only to do it all again after class."
good,Do a facility inspection and make sure everything in the theatre is in place. Check concession stand and box office and make sure they stocked for business.
good,"This isn't the kind of job you stay in forever, unless you want this job forever. It's an easy job but it is a very busy job. It's also a cool perk to get free movies."
good,its a cool work place can be fun at times but the gm and managers are jerks they think they are the greatest and they have unprofessional relationships with workers
good,"For my first job, it was okay. Friday and Saturday nights were crazy busy. The things I enjoyed about here was the free movies and seeing that smile on my customers faces. I left this job learning that even if your doing a lot without the right amount of pay, the people I met throughout the day brings me happiness."
good,"Depending on the area you work in there are a variety of tasks to be completed. You can do anything from cleaning theaters and changing trashes, manning the concessions and preparing food and drinks, or box office cashiering. The actual tasks are not the most enjoyable, therefore moral and encouragement of management made significant difference. In my experience, there was not room for growth or even raises within the company unless you wanted to be a manager. The hardest part was not the job itself, but keeping calm under stress and working at a fast pace. If you are good at those two things, this job is not difficult. The best part of working here was getting free movie tickets."
good,Preparing food and popcorn for the customers. Cleaning out theaters after showings and taking out trash at night. Escorting elderly customers to designated movies and checking in ticket stubs.
good,"Hands-on experience in accepting payments from customers and give change and receipts"
good,"A typical day at regal cinemas was simple, it was easy paced. I learned how to work movie theater machinery, and how to make popcorn. Managers were kind but it seemed to me as though they pick favorites, but that happens. My coworkers were over all easy going and fun to be around. The hardest part of the job were movie releases just because there was so many customers all at once. The most enjoyable part of the job was free movies."
good,"Was an interesting, and unique job. I enjoyed the benefits of working here, however the management was extremely poor, having favoritism among other employees."
good,Great place to work. Not a bad stepping stone unless you are looking to move up the Regal ladder. Not every place is for everyone but this might just be for you!
good,"Its a fun place to work if you like movies. Sadly, there isnt much of an advancement, unless the postilion is actually available. Customers can be hard to handle sometimes, and dont expect a life outside of work, as you work all weekend."
good,"Working at the theatre was enjoyable at times. During slow days you are able to accomplish your work better and sometimes even when you are in a rush, the job gets interesting. Dealing with many of the people was great as I meet many famous and interesting people. The part I would say that was the least enjoyable was often when you dealt with some of the general management team at the theatre. The managers who were there the longest often favored people over others. The benefits that the company gave you were a joke. The only thing you really benefited form was the ability to watch a film for free and after that you really had no benefits at all. Very little support from the general management."
good,Free movies whenever. Great people to work with. very fast paced and keeps you on your toes. lots of running around. Very easy job and not very demanding
good,"A typical day at work depends on what I am assigned to do.  Usually I am scheduled as an Usher or on concession. When I am an usher, a typical day at work would be, helping customers getting to the correct auditorium, opening doors for customers, cleaning auditoriums, and taking out trash.  We would also go and cover the door person, who is tearing tickets as they go on break.  Usually, the opening Usher or closing Usher is in charge of assigning Ushers' and door's break.  I usually am opening Usher so I am in charge of making sure the break schedules go smoothly and make sure everyone gets their break.  I learned a lot of leadership, the importance of customer service, and productivity.  My co-workers usually work very well together.  We always get along well.  I work extremely well with a team or by myself. "
good,I have no opinion as a past employee. I was precepting during my last semester of nursing school. The school nurse was a great woman and very helpful in her role.
good,"Great job for the teen years but definitely is a position you can grow out of though. Learned customer service skills, management was okay."
good,"At Regal Cinemas, you are given several task a day that where you are given the responsibility to maintain the cleanliness and order to the movie theaters. Sweeping and engaging customers on movies will be a daily task. Must get used to standing and mundane task."
good,"Cash handling, provided prompt, efficient, friendly, and quality service at all times, following the liquor laws in Nevada, and handling food and beverages were some of the responsibilities I performed while working here. I only left this job because I was returning to school in a different state."
good,"A typical day at work is alright."
good,Typical day included dealing with customers who were usually pleasant and attempting to satisfy even the angry ones. Management above the theater level always seemed out of touch with how theaters should be run and what is possible with constant reduction in hours available  to staff.
good,"On a typical day, I would clock in between 8:30am and 12 noon, and clock out at 6pm.  Most of my time was spent attending to customers at the concession stand, but when business was slow, I would be assigned other tasks, such as cleaning equipment behind the concession stand, cleaning the movie theaters, cleaning windows, and various other tasks.  "
good,"Customer/food services(non management). Depending on location customers can be unpleasant and detestable. I learned to appreciate the few honorable, outstanding people in society. Management was variable from one to another, some great to ""that one"" degenerate. Co workers were easy going but the few that entered employment who lacked total competency for such an easy task reduced the enjoyment. The hardest part was not throwing something at devolved customers who appeared to lack any awareness of their surroundings and serving them with a smile. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the employees that are from all sorts of different walks of life."
good,"Horrible management, poor employee appreciation. I dont want to fill this out so that is basically all that needs to be said,"
good,"A typical day would be to work as an usher and provide excellent customer service by collecting customer's tickets and providing information. I would also clean the theaters after movie viewing was over after each viewing, along with a team. I would sweep, pick up garbage and clean the area. I also closed once a week, which meant cleaning the food area, which included the pop corn machine and making sure all the theaters were clean."
good,Depending on your availability there is not that much of an increase in hours that you will receive sure to the number of employees and how the theater operates. There is hardly a pay increase when working there and depending on how long you work there you're pay will hardly increase from minimum wage. The environment is great. The people that you encounter are simply enjoyable.
good,"Regal was a wonderful job and I learned many things while working there. It was my first real job after I graduated high school and I learned a lot about customer service/appreciation and how a business should operate. I loved most of my management team and my staff member team because we all knew what needed to be done and we did it, there was never any problems or confusion. The hardest part of the job was when a big anticipated movie was released and rush hour was more like rush eight hours but It was fun."
good,"Normal day would include working at the concessions stands giving people food and sometimes cleaning the theaters after movies. First day I was lied to by management, they said I would be an usher 4 times a week and work at concessions 1 day a week but it was reversed."
good,"It was like every other job. Clean, help, and get yelled at by customers while smiling at them all for minimum wage."
good,Working at Regal is definitely an experience. All of my coworkers are super cool and down to earth. The managers at my location are a little iffy but for the most part it’s a good place to work. It would be good as a first job.
good,I was paid minimum wage for a job but I definitely should've been paid more for the things that I had to do. The place wasn't the cleanest and my manager at the time seemed like she was cutting corners to save money.
good,"Enjoyable place to work with a fun and friendly staff. The staff will help with any issues or troubles that the customers may have, and finish it in a quick and precise manner."
good,"It's a decent job that requires you to work 9 - 10 hours each day from Friday - Sunday. The workload presented to you requires another employee to help you but, management doesn't schedule another employee to work with you. Therefore, you will have to do the job of two employees during busy weekends."
good,"It's a great place to work if you need the job experience. If you're looking for a place where you can grow and advance, then this is not it. There is no opportunity for promotion or a pay increase."
good,"I enjoyed working at Regal Cinemas and probably would have left a stellar review about working there, up until a year ago. There is favoritism within the ranks and it is hard to overcome. A lot of immaturity within the management. The GM likes a certain manager and will stand by their side no matter what. Said manager does not like certain people and literally chooses sides. It was a great place and a fun place to work prior to this. However, whenever I tried talking to the GM he shut me down. He never has time to hear what his employees have to say. When he does, he avoids the topic as much as possible."
good,"Its a good starting job, very social and very busy most days. You are not always doing the same thing everyday, you have four main jobs cleaning making the food selling tickets and checking them."
good,"A typical day at work would be to do stuff that the other shift did not. I am not sure what the atmosphere is going to be like. There is new structures, new management. Everything was changing before i left."
good,They would schedule me to work on days that I told them i couldn't work anyways. The manager wasn't communicating with me. They wasn't training properly.
good,"the job was okay, at some points it was the best job ever, then the job was annoying. the men were sexist. because I was in high school my week day shifts were 5 hours, and weekends were 8 hours."
good,fun place to work decent benefits (2 free tickets a day) but the managers were either really nice and easy to get along with or horrible to be around cant blame them though starting manager wage is 10$ a hour starting floor staff was 7.25 (minimum wage)
good,"If you're looking for an in between jobs kind of place, I'd suggest this company. I had no problems with the job itself or a majority of my coworkers. Management could've been better in terms of attitude and communication."
good,"The location I worked at struggled hiring quality workers and managers. This left a majority of the work and responsibilities to a select few that proved they were capable and willing to do the work. It operated a lot like high school socially, so I suggest not getting involved too much and to not share too much about yourself. I personally had to go through three HR scandals, all of which were avoidable and made my work life increasingly difficult. The work is only really bad when its super busy, otherwise its fine."
good,"It's an okay place too work, not the best. The hours can be either horrible or decent, and the company isn't up to par. Managers are great though. Don't get paid too well, but 8.25 is better than 7.25, granted if you have a decent amount of bills, I wouldn't recommended applying unless you really stretch the dollar."
good,This is a fun place to work. Most of the staff is friendly and is and good job. Do not recommend this being a permanent job but good place to start off. Flexible hours.
good,"A typical day at work is finding what to do because there isn't much to do except waiting for a movie to finish and clean the theater. It was my first job, so I learned to have a work ethic and how to do things at a workplace. Management was pretty good and the coworkers were okay. The hardest part was working on the concession stand because it was a lot to handle when I wasn't trained in that part. The most enjoyable part was walking around the theater when a movie is playing to see if people are silent and orderly."
good,When I first walk in I clock in and go straight to my position. Then I usually stay there for my entire shift unless they ask me to do something else. I learned how to do everything there except for what the managers do.The management is nice for the most part all of them seem friendly. There is not anything that is really hard or too easy.
good,There were good benefits and excitement to work in the beginning but that fades. Changes that take away perks continue to destroy morale. Between customers projector issues young staff strict policies the frustration and stress will hit you hard.
good,Working at Regal Cinemas is a fun experience. You get to meet and talk to many different types ot people which makes the job fun for me. My disappointment comes to the poor paying wages that regal gives.
good,"The company treats its entry level employees better than its long term and senior employees. The company expectations on their field teams is almost unobtainable and they do not provide you with the tools to be able to meet those goals. Rules are constantly changing with no notice and you are held accountable to those without knowing it. In the words of one higher up ""you are all replaceable and this company has no problem with turn over"". Not very motivating. The company is broken up into five regions and no region is operated the same. Standards and expectations vary widely amongst them."
good,"A good starting place to work for anyone trying to balance a life outside of work (students, family, etc.). Lack of advancement, low salary for management if I was to stay, and unpredictable customers and work hours, but if you like movies, talking to others about them, and don't mind getting a little dirty, then it's a great job."
good,"If you’re looking for a easy relaxed workplace for a first job I would really reccomend regal. I loved working here, at times it got busy but you got to see free movies whenever you wanted and the atmosphere was just really positive and nice and I enjoyed being there."
good,"Regal is a good place to work if you are looking for something temporary  until you find better opportunities, then this is a decent place to begin.  If you do begin your path here stay positive and polite."
good,a typical day at work on a busy day would be fast paced moving and fast working on a slow day there would be nothing to do after a while so people would just be sitting around
good,"An unfair amount of work was expected for 16, 17, and 18 year olds for only being paid minimum wage. Shift were long and I often didn't leave until well after midnight."
good,It's been nearly two decades since I worked for Regal so I would be hard pressed to say much about them. I enjoyed the people I worked with a great deal but can't say much else for the time I was there.
good,"This job is a great first job in order to get experience with employment, customer service, cash handling, and cleaning. "
good,During the school year months things were very slow and it made life easy. During the holidays and summer period I did not enjoy working here. A lot of turnover in all positions made work culture poor. I made some great friends working here.
good,"The hardest part of the job would be working an evening shift on the weekend by yourself when someone doesn't show up or calls in too late. When that happens you have to clean theaters with 70+ people and on top of movies ending around the same time, with some people staying to the end of the credits. Besides that its a great work environment and fun when its not crowded with people."
good,They dont have much understanding i had alot going on and i tried to explain it to them but i still was fired. The amount we did for pay was not fair at all because we would stay till 1 am or more even when we did the best we could.
good,Nice first job place to work . Works well with people available . The pay wasnt good . But it was a decent place to work and get the first job experience..
good,You learn how to assist customers. You learn more respect when you go out to public places. When I worked there sometimes I did not leave until 4:00 in the morning. There is so much cleaning involved with Regal. The most injoyable part of the job was some of the benefits. But you are at work so much that you do not have time for your social life. It feels like you live at Regal. The management was poor because some of the managers were unfair and out to get you if the don’t like you.
good,This job is exactly that...a job. It got increasingly difficult to meet the demands of the company. I found it difficult to want to stay at this job for a long period of time. Became unhappy with work stress and drive.
good,"This is a good place for someone starting out or someone who wants to make a career in the theater business. I, however, do not want a career in the theater business."
good,Loved the people but the job was bad. They never scheduled enough people to work the busy shifts so it could be extremely stressful for the few who worked.
good,"Go in, do your job, and go home. Fairly relaxed work environment with the occasional rush on the weekends. Would recommend to someone with no work experience."
good,the job was alright but the pay sucked. some of the managers were very good but most did not do anything to help the staff.the most enjoyable part of the job was the free movies.
good,"It was difficult grabbing the reigns because I was constantly being yelled at, even if I did something right I was yelled at. The environment is stressful and the managers would tell me ""its okay to sweep popcorn under the seats while doing cleans, they cant see in the dark."""
good,"Typical movie theater job..."
good,"Always had fun, the managers were never too hard on you. The pay was low though, too low for the work we did. The managers were always chaotic, no one knew where to be."
good,"Decent job for high school, but management is terrible for the long run. hardest part of the job is the customers"
good,"IF you want a part job to earn extra money and don't mind working weekends and holidays is not bad. If your looking for a more long term job this isnt a great place. Everyone is underpaid and GMs are the only ones that get any real benefits like bonuses and extra days off. And if youve have GMs like the ones I experienced, they do none of the work and reep all the rewards."
good,Working at a movie theater is great for teenagers looking for their first job.  Not good place for an adult looking for a career or high paying job.  Good learning experience.
good,Cleaning up popcorn after a children's movie is brutal. Kicking people out for having relations in public was interesting. The people that you work with will make or break your experience.
good,"The place was an amazing place to work at in the beginning, the coworkers were nice and so was the managers. After a while it drags on and does not provide anymore."
good,The most enjoyable part of the day is interacting with your coworkers. management is clueless on how to do most things leaving you wondering how they got there. Most employees are high school/ college aged with the majority being high school.
good,It was difficult to work there since you could be written up for anything. If your looking for things that are wrong your going to find it since no one is perfect. If they didn't like someone they could get them out quickly.
good,Typically one would work on weekends and holidays because that is the requirement of the job. Normally working 8 hours a shift however it is annoying when they cut your shift. The job is not easy and the customers do not make it easier.
good,"You arrive at work and work long hours. If you are looking for such an opportunity then look no further than this. However, your personal life will be left in shambles as you have no free time due to either lack of sleep or time itself. This was my first job and in the beginning I enjoyed it, but as they denied time after time and the amount of stress for so little pay, I had to move away from this company."
good,"Working at Regal was only enjoyable for the friends I made within my coworkers. The pay was not worth it for the work required. It was a reasonable high school job, but once I began to attend college it no longer was worth the time. Customers can be pushy, and weekends are tough and very fast-paced. Was required to work holidays unless requested off months in advance."
good,"All things considered, it's a good first job for a teenager. However be prepared to face the worst of mankind as you will be consistently berated for things that are not under your control, also get ready to clean up after hundreds of messy people daily. Poor advancement opportunities as well."
good,"Overall, Regal was a good place to work. It kept you busy and was clean and had high standards. I could not deal with the late hours of closing and getting out at 3 AM daily."
good,"Regal Entertainment Group is a fast-paced environment with generally fun workers. With that said, management isn't all that great and the hours are all over the place. Poor management and poor scheduling ruined the experience for me."
good,"It's a good job if you are just starting out teaches you customer service guidelines and is willing to give you experience most places won't , management is unpleasant but hours are good depending on which location you are at"
good,I was working at regal for a part time job while I was going to school. They repeatedly gave me schedules that interfered with my class schedule and school work even after notifying them of the problem.
good,Management needs to focus on their employees and care for them. The cast members have more attention than the management.
good,"Fun, easy going place to work. Very flexible schedule if you have school or another job. Nights, weekends and holidays are the busiest. Management has their days, like anywhere else. Overall easy job."
good,A typical day is busy and keeps you on your feet majority of the time. I enjoy the rush at times because it allows the day to move smoothly.
good,Communication between management and workers was minimal and often times employees were not fully trained. Employees also never learned much about upper-management or were never informed of the qualities and skills needed to move up the ladder.
good,very laid back job. everyone becomes your family. There is nothing hard about the job but its pay. Really don't get raises often even if your the best employee there. There is room for advancement but the pay is not much more than floor staff. Not really worth being in a higher position!
good,"Designing posters, banner and editing photos before publishing. get to deal with suppliers, celebrities, director and producers"
good,"Working at a movie theater was an experience! It was fun getting to usher because you can get glimpses of some of the movies, also you get two free movie tickets to see any movie and that's always great! Its a great job to have while in high school."
good,"Regal HVAC was a good company to be with.  This plant in Springfield had always been in the top ten of profit return for the company.  Their decision to transfer production to Mexico has now been seen as a mistake; however, it was a corporate level decision not a regional or local one.  "
good,"At Regal Destiny USA 19 IMAX and RPX work is constant.  We serve, check and clean.  Great work traits learned from this job are customer service, responsibility and teamwork.  As a team, the workers and management work together to provide a joyful experience for all patrons and movie-goers."
good,This company has a lot of rules to be just a movie theater. Sell sell sell
good,"This is a nice first job while in school, other wise it's not that great. When I worked here a bunch of my friends from school worked there as well so it was fun. But Once you turn 18 you are eligible to work past nine, which can really suck as you can be the only one able to do certain things that the minors can't do. In the end I left because of to much school interference."
good,"There is a lot of customer service working at a movie theater, especially Regal Cinemas, so you must be prepared to serve the customer and be able to help anyway you can. Being a concessionist, you must deal with providing food while upsizing and suggestive selling, as you are a salesperson. Usually, you'll find the best part of the job are your co-workers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the constant need of the customers, along with closing the concession stand, as many late nights ensue. Though, you do tend to see free movies as a plus for employment."
good,"Good work environment, flexible with schedules. 6 hour shifts, very busy, long lines, constantly dealing with customers in the summer and on weekends. weekdays typically standing around bored waiting to close."
good,At first I enjoyed working at the movie theaters enjoying the free movies. The compensation however was not great and I did not get a raise after a year. I did like my coworkers and meeting new people. I worked there for a year before I found out it was time to leave for other endeavors.
good,"Assistant manger including hiring, socializing, counseling, and firing of employees. Handled all duties handed down by the general manager.  Customers service was crucial. Handling of complaints and customer questions while helping during times of heavy business in the concession stand, ushering, or where needed.  Best part of the job was it was fun and laid back.  Some down time during the day.  Worst part of the job was the customers who attempted to gain something free by making up complaints."
good,"Various jobs through out the day, from cleaning, cashier work, customer care and satisfaction, learned how to be a proper team leader. Management was ok there is room for improvement when it came to employees and their needs. co-workers were awesome and that was the best part of being at work. The work wasn't hard. The most enjoyable part of the job i can say was seeing the new faces and old faces come and enjoy their movie."
good,It was a job that held my position as I joined the military and went away to college.
good,"This job was perfect if you're 16 and need cash for doing whatever it is teenagers do nowadays. There is healthcare insurance but I didn't pay to much attention, there was a fast response with workman comp, (which I received a packet in the mail pertaining to this when I burned myself. Never went to the doctor though so I didn't claim). Too many managers and easy to promote to manager as well. On my shift we have four managers wandering the floor at all times, each giving a directive order and no cohesiveness of working with one another to properly manage the floor staff. I was told one thing and in the next breath told another. I did enjoy my coworkers even though I was the oldest on the night shift. But that was fine, because the lot of them thought I was in high school until I started talking about college. Definitely a booster to self esteem :) The hardest part of this job I would have to say would be the difficult people who came in with a chip on their shoulder for one reason or another and then having to diffuse a combative customer or try to before going to management. The most enjoyable part was who I worked with. "
good,"A typical day at regal would range from greeting customers at door, or cleaning theater auditoriums and half hourly restroom checks on floor. A typical day in concessions involves suggestive selling, up selling and suggesting the Regal rewards program."
good,"Working at the Regal was very unpredictable. Some days we would be ridiculously slow, and some would be the opposite. You never exactly knew what you were in for."
good,A typical day at work is customer service with food and high prices. you can learn the basic skills for customer service. the management there is really nice. the co-workers there are also really young so being old there is kinda awkward. the hardest part of the job is trying to move up in the company. i worked there for 5 years and attempted all those years for management and didn't get it.
good,Generally the job is all about customer service and maintaining a clean work environment. Management is very laid back and your co-workers are generally first time jobers or college students looking for part time work. The job is not that hard and you do get to see movies for free.
good,A decent job. Not something I would want to do for the rest of my life. Concession was my strong point. I'm good under pressure (ex. busy friday and saturday nights!)
good,"Working at Regal Entertainment Group you will see your job is very secure, there is no room for advancement of almost any kind raises are slim to none and come once a year."
good,"Nice starter job, free movies are a plus. It's a fairly relaxing job since you mostly sit around until there's a theater to clean. Concession gets a little hectic but it's usually in short bursts."
good,"Its a good company to work for because of the flexible hours, the people you get to meet and the regular which are usually nice. Has its ups and downs but which job doesn't. To work for this company is a decent way to spend your nights but the morning shifts allows you more of a social life"
good,This is a good starting job but it has a lot of drawbacks. For one the shifts are terrible for example the earliest shift is 11am to 6pm but this is remedied by how lenient they are with the schedule. Only job I know where you can call out 2 hours before your shift and they’ll be fine with it. The workers there are also pretty cool. But the GM is toxic. The work was also draining but that’s the nature of serving people.
good,"Regal provides just about every opportunity they can, as long as you are willing to jump at them. But that often came at a price of a terrible work/life balance. Ended up working 60+ hours a week, every week. Almost always worked 6 days a week, sometimes 7. Terrible working hours."
good,"they force you to close even on school nights, they have you staying until 1am sometimes even if you finish closing early you still have to find something to do. you never get rewarded for working hard."
good,"They try to work with your schedule as best as possible, but often you’ll have to work on days you need often. Most times they can be understaffed and customers can get easily agitated over the smallest things. You have to make sure you are fast and happy."
good,"Was a decent work environment not many difficult tasks. Have to be very fast paced and a detailed cleaner during huge movie releases. It’s very overwhelming if you experience personal issues like anxiety, you will encounter very rude customers also. Management can be really unorganized and useless sometimes."
good,it was fun seeing different actors and actresses in the industry also the staffs are kind and happy to be with but the salary is lower than i expected.
good,Regular days were often very relaxed and at some times slow. A busy day was very busy and made work very stressful. I learned that if you don't have good time management you will get behind on your task. Managment at the establishment was fine but seemed a bit distant. The culture the employees and managers created was a pretty relaxed one and would make it fun to chat with co-workers. The hardest part of the job was working the Usher position on a busy day. The most enjoyable part of the day was being able to talk with your co-workers when the day was slowing down and I could really start to bond and build relationships.
good,When big movies are out its busy.  Regal has become less fun to work at since being bought by another company. Still a good part time job if you're just looking for extra cash.
good,"Management is not the greatest at times, it can be very stressful and chaotic, and you are often not recognized for your hard work. However, the free movies, free movie merchandise, (mostly) amazing coworkers, and unique and diverse experience is great. There are a lot of bad eggs, but I have made some of the most incredible friends and acquaintances working here. I would not recommend this job if you have a curfew or if you are not able to work late nights (past 12 am)."
good,"My time working at Regal has been fair. I enjoy the benefit of getting free movies, however, I was disappointed that shortly after starting the company policy around this changed to a much more limited benefit. Starting at 2 free tickets a day, the policy changed to 2 free tickets a week, which for someone like myself who enjoys seeing a few movies a week, made it hard to save a free ticket for a guest with multiple movies to see. "
good,A typical day would start with us being understaffed on a busy day and me having to clean up after everyone. I learned that no matter how much effort you put into a certain thing people will always have something negative to say about you. The management wasn't the best but there were a few managers that went above and beyond to carry the load for the other managers. The workplaces culture can be summed up to this: if you're new good luck. The hardest part of the job is that no one tells you how to do things or the easiest ways to do things. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with new found friends.
good,"a typical work day could be busy or slow it just depends. "
good,When I worked there I would a lot of hours and it wasn’t worth the paid for what I was doing. Sometimes it’s not that bad but when we get new movies in and we were short staffed you could be working for 10am-12pm with only 3 30 minutes breaks. Overall not a terrible place to work but not my favorite job.
good,"I loved working at Regal for its mindlessness. You get to watch free movies and have discounted concessions. However I was a college student at the time and when I needed to live on my own Regal is a poor source of income. They are strictly minimum wage which the phrase ""minimum wage"" is a debate in itself in the work force. "
good,"Regal Theaters is a great entry level job where you are given the basic skills to work with a team and high volume customers. Some of the negatives working for regal include disorganized manager staff, lacking employment opportunities. Working at Regal has been a great experience for me"
good,After Regal got bought out by a British company things went from fun (or at least bearable) to h***. Half of my managers left in the span of a few months along with most of the experienced employees. Myself and a small handful of people are the last few experienced people left over and we don't plan to stay much longer.
good,When I first started everything was great up until we got bought out by another company who wanted to change everything and after that it just didn’t feel like regal anymore
good,"My time at Regal Cinemas was something I never regretted. I enjoyed working there and interacting with employees I had come to grow close with, as well as interacting with customers on a daily basis. The problems arise when it comes to management; managers constantly complaining to employees about one another, forcing them to choose sides. It became an unhealthy work environment towards the end of my time there."
good,"I didn't learn much working at Regal, if anything the only thing I was taught there was how to use a register and how to make popcorn. The managers did their jobs and they did them well most of the time but sometimes it felt like they didn't care about our employee experience or advancement."
good,"Average business days will keep you busy enough for the day to go by, but depending on the time of day and movies out you could either be struggling to find things to do or so busy you can't catch a break."
good,The work experience is easy. It's a pretty self explanatory job. The management was disorganized and tended to be unprofessional. The rules are constantly changing and the managers often do what they tell you not to.
good,I learned how to interact with all different people. Most of the managers were good. Hardest part was working during movie releases. Most enjoyable part was free movies and being usher.
good,"cleaning, handling food, learned how to deal with customers and money, ok management, ,cleaning on busy theater days, having free movies, getting half off in concessions"
good,All together not a bad experience. When big movies come out they do a good job of helping the employees out to get the long rushes done. Good communication. Downfall is pay the pay is way too low compared to what other people are getting payed
good,It’s an okay first job. Not a lot of advancement options. Pay wasn’t great and didn’t get a raise until a year in (only 10 cents more per year) especially compared to other locations around the area.
good,"Many changes occurring too frequently to make them stick or know what your number one focus is. The hours are very flexible and I am in a position to make my own schedule which is great. Working all holidays, many evenings and weekends is difficult."
good,"It was laid-back but the management didn't really care what happened to you. You are definitely expendable to them. Co-workers were cool. It was usually pretty slow, especially during the week."
good,"Paid the bare minimum wage of $7.25 an hour just so I could work a 9 hour (variable) shift scrubbing floors at 1 o clock in the morning. And this was while I was in high school. The second I turned 18 I was going to school for 8 hours and then scheduled to work from 3 to 11, but my managers wouldn't let me go until the entire kitchen was spotless, and some nights I was the only person scheduled for close. God forbid when black panther, starwars, etc came out because those customers were still ordering at midnight and I was there late cleaning kitchens alone. Too stressful for too little pay. It was a good first job only on the account that I know when im 22, I dont want to be making only $7 an hour after college, as many of my coworkers at the time found themselves doing at ages of 22 and older there."
good,"Low Income, few hours, management varies depending upon the manager. There is no customer accountability. Whenever a serious issue arrises with a customer, the floor staff employee is in no position to help due to management having all of the power. Customers can basically behave in any manner they please and employees have to deal with unnecessary behavior with no power to stop it."
good,"I work at a regal where nothing has been updating in maybe 10 years, not to mention we're always understaffed. I have never gotten a weekend off and with all the big releases i've been working 4 to 5 days in a row. A typical day is clocking in and seeing where I'm being placed then going there and counting in. This was my first job so I learned about using a cash register and whatnot. Management is really nice and my co workers are absolutely amazing people %70 of the time. The hardest part of the job are extremely busy days (new release weekends and holidays) and the best is being around some of my amazing coworkers"
good,"After 4 years with the company, I can honestly say that the only major changes within the company are leadership and movie titles--in that order. Leadership affects how the business is ran and how payroll, pay, etc is distributed and movie titles are what keep people employed. The environment is usually fairly fast paced and the job is never done. The pay is mostly stagnant and job is usually the same if not more. The most enjoyable part of working for the company is the connection you maintain with your colleagues. The relationships are mostly positive and pleasant. The biggest downfall for the company is the lack of opportunity for true growth for individuals , yet the inevitable need for more work to get done."
good,"While working in the concessions is fast paced and occasionally stressful, the time flies by very quickly, and you learn to work around and with your co-workers. Management is super helpful and understanding."
good,This job was great for the facts of environment and learning. When it comes down to the truth it was horrible. The managers above just care about payroll. They take forever for reviews. And all breaks loose if you get a bad mystery shopper score. It's horrible. I relocated and wasn't making close to enough for a 1 bedroom apartment. I was forced to quit and move out of state.
good,the job is fun most days but there are drawbacks like working holidays and the management I worked under specifically the general  manager was a tyrant and did not care about employees
good,"It's a fine place to work as a teenager, but once you graduate high school, you can do better. It's a lot of work and really stressful when  busy. Minimum wage sucks."
good,You will be expected to always be available on the weekends and holidays as those are the busiest times for the company. But you get to watch free movies
good,Overall my time working at Regal town center 16 has been good. The people there are very accepting and fun to be around. My only problems with the job is the hours and pay. Not only do we get paid biweekly we only get paid the lowest amount minimum wage $8.10 which doesn’t really support my bills and things like that. The hours were hard as well bc we open at like 12:00 so it takes up your whole day.
good,"If you're a teenager in high school who's looking to keep a couple bucks in your pocket, then go for it. It sucks that you get paid every two weeks tho"
good,"A typical day at work was pretty decent depending on your position that day. Box is usually chill or busy, concessions is usually filled with high school drama, door is boring but chill, and ushering is chill but can be gross or past paced. "
good,get to working at fast fun place environment. You do not know who going to walk into the door so everyday is a surprise. Sometime I got to meet famous people. Some time I got hang out with my friend while I'm working. Got to see all the movie as many as you want.
good,it's fun to work and get free tickets. it's best for teens and young adults. advancement is slow and not worth it. listening to customer complaints about concession prices gets old fast.
good,Working weekends sucks to be honest. Most of the employees are in high school so working on Friday and Saturday nights gets old fast especially when you're a senior. Missing spending time with friends and parties isn't worth being scheduled for a Friday night when you only work 3-4 hours since you get sent home early due to no business. Wouldn't recommend for kids in school. 1. You make no money and 2. Bad hours for the few you get.
good,Great job for teens good working environment.You can get a good amount of hours they pay different amounts at each site.They will be alot of busy dates.
good,"A decent place to work with flexible hours and a relatively relaxed environment. I would recommend this job to someone first starting out, looking to build their resume through customer service opportunities."
good,"great people to work with, management is always joking around. customers are jerks sometimes so you need to be able to not say what you are really thinking. lots of cleaning and some down calm times"
good,"The business itself is alright, the management however needs some work. Very poor distribution of hours unless you are a manager favorite. The free movies are very nice however."
good,Regal Cinemas is a job for like high school kids or retired folks looking for just a little cash in their pockets. Not a bad job just not something you would look for as in trying to bring home big bucks.
good,"most shifts are the same. you may even see the same customers you saw the day before. Great for high schoolers looking for job experience or some extra money. management is management. exactly what youd expect at a movie theater. everyone you work with is probably the same age as you so you probably will get along with most everyone. hardest part of the job is probably cleaning throwup if need be, if not then keeping up with the weekend tempo. most enjoyable part of job was if you worked an 8 hour shift you got a 30-45min break where you could get discounted food and watch some of a movie."
good,my experience wasn't the best. I feel like management was poorly organized which made and already stressful job more stressful. The work load was often too much for minimum wage pay. left as quickly as i could but it helped me grow and taught me how to deal with stressful work situations.
good,The job overall is fairly easy and a great place to make friends. It's nearly impossible to move up in the company or even secure pay raises. I worked for over a year (told there were employee checks ever 3 months) and only got one raise: $7.25-$7.41
good,"It goes fast then really slow. In between the movie blocks, it may take you about 20 minutes to restock all of the food items and get the concession stands cleaned up then you're just kinda left standing there for the next hour to 2 hours waiting for the next block to begin."
good,"I started out as an associate manager and watched several managers get disciplined into quitting or transferring. The general manager knew how to manipulate the system and was very critical if he heard or thought there was anything less than perfection and instead of teaching there would be a write up putting you on ""first step."" I was promoted to Ops manager and less than 6 months later I was getting write ups for things that were so vague I couldn't fix it and eventually resigned because it got so out of control I was feeling targeted and was on the verge of a breakdown."
good,"Working in the concessions was dangerous, the floor was slippery and hot oil burned the workers quite often. Once I was burned badly and management didn't have any medical supplies to relieve the injury. Drama between managers and floor staff caused many to be upset and some quit."
good,"Fun atmosphere, but I could not see myself having a career at this company.  However, as a college student home for summers, this was an excellent job."
good,"A typical day depends on what position you're put into. Floor work was my most enjoyable, despite the negatives of cleaning theaters and dealing with trash, I was always mobile. Closing the theater was the main position that gave independence and responsibility short of managerial duties."
good,Regal is a fun place to work especially when just starting out. Some benefits include free movies and they work with your schedule pretty well. Required to work weekends and when closing you stay late. Open everyday of the year so holidays are hard to get off.
good,"Typical days vary by position"
good,"A typical day at work selling movie tickets, concession items, taking tickets from guest while directing them to their proper theater. Cleaning theaters after a movie gets out. Cleaning bathrooms, halls and bathrooms. Changing the marquee with new show times. "
good,"a typical day was busy, we greeted guest and we also cleaned theaters . i learned about team work how to work with a large group. management sucked they had their picks, my co workers was fun it helped the night."
good,"In my experience of working with Regal I've grown as an individual and a team player. It's a very fast pace and efficient business. We go above and beyond to assure the guests are satisfied with their visit. However scheduling has been a problem there. You have to be very available and open to work there. You often can find yourself prioritizing Regal before your outside of work lifestyle. There's no fixed schedule, so plans and appointments outside of work can clash  with work and become very inconvenient. They make sure you don't go over 40 hours in a week, so you'd be lucky if you hit 30. Regale main priority is their system. They don't care about your inconveniences. They are more focused on what's convient to them."
good,"I loved working there yet as time went by I realized I was trying to hard to stand out and not being recognized for it. I worked at the same theatre for 8 years. I always thought I would get somewhere with the business yet I got let down quarter after quarter and also every time reveiw time came around, which was every 3 or 6 months,  my review score wold be below 80 and I would never get more than a 10 cent raise yet I was always doing my work as well as more work of others. The last review I finally before leaving I scored 95 and I got a $1.25 raise . It just made me feel so misguided. Especially since I starter working there at $6.50 hr...."
good,Almost none of the employes liked the job and the only real chance for recognition from the boss was if you were an over confident showoff. Lots of great customer experience so overall I greatly enjoyed it.
good,"Everyday is very different, and I was always in for something new. It would either be super busy, or super dead. I sometimes I would work 12 hours sometimes i would only work 2 hours. Very wishy washy."
good,"A typical day at work consists of cleaning, light cooking, and an abundance of interaction with guests. You learn better communication skills and how to adjust to a continuously moving work place. Management is around to assists when needed. The hardest part of the job is working on your feet for so many hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is the sense of community and meeting people from many different cultural backgrounds that share the same interests as you."
good,"Employees were quite limited so one had to wear a lot of hats. "
good,"Working for regal is a fun first job and it is easy to make friends. However it is almost impossible to advance in position and raises consist of a few cents. Most coworkers were great to work with although some were lazy. I was able to receive a decent amount of hours and they were flexible with my school schedule. "
good,This company made many changes during my employment. They were not completely prepared for.The co-workers were friendly. The hardest part was knowing what was expected of you.
good,"My main jobs were in the concession stand and box office, occasionally helping out the ushers as well. I was responsible for taking the guests' orders, preparing it, and bringing to them or selling them their tickets. Most of my shifts were closing shifts, so I was responsible for closing down and cleaning the concession stand. I was also asked to train new employees. I enjoyed working with my colleagues and learned a lot about customer service in this job."
good,If I ever went to the GM with a complaint they would tell the person I complained about them. One manager in particular would try to convince me that what happened didn't happen and try to convince me to withdraw my complaint.However the rest of the staff was very kind and had a good balance of being 'in charge' without being rude.
good,"Things were disorganized at times and rules kept changing every so often where it seemed that we couldn't do any while working. Like one rule was that we couldn't see a movie on a day that we requested off, we would have to be not scheduled to be able to see a movie for free but usually I was always scheduled to work."
good,"This company is good but the pay is not good. there isnt any room for advancement and if there is, it wont be anything elaborate. Its a good job during high school."
good,Loved the work because I love movies and the overall environment. The hours suck and the managers were okay but when it comes down to it they do not always help you and blame you for stuff that goes wrong.
good,"Unless you're a lifetime movie fanatic, DO NOT WORK HERE."
good,weekdays are slow no one comes. Good place to learn people skills and dealing with money. Most of the co workers are fun to be around. The hardest part about the job is just dealing with anxious customers during busy hours.
good,"As most minimum wage jobs are, the work here is monotonous and labor-intensive. Workers are not highly valued, and promotions are few and far between, sometimes going to workers whom others are surprised to see promoted. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet for hours on end, but it's nice to enjoy free movies."
good,"The overall production is great. Regal Cinemas knows how to make money and their main objective on keeping the customers happy is great in theory. I have been with the company for 8yrs; from the bottom to the top. When I first started the management team were more hands on and seemed to enjoy the job. Now, the Regal has to compete with Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, etc. and hours and the overall joy in being a manager has died. The Obama taxation has really brought my use to be happy environment into a stressful overly working job."
good,"Good job for high school and college students.  Not an ideal career after college.  Flexible work hours and friendly co-workers.  Over the years, the company became more concerned with the bottom line rather than keeping employees satisfied.  High turnover."
good,"As an Associate Manager, I was responsible for all of the daily operations of the theatre. I was also responsible for hiring, orientation, terminations, creating weekly movie schedule, weekly concession order and numerous other tasks. Customer service is very important in this line of business. You have to have a lot of patience dealing with variety of customers. It is a an okay entry level position but the pay is low and working weekends, nights and holidays is not ideal. Also, the company is very 'bottom line' oriented and therefore their main focus is on the profit and not the customer or employees."
good,I did not like working there because management could not handle everyone's hours. Most people barely ever worked.
good,The job was extremely easy. I was lied to by my manager. The typical day was greeting guests as they came in.
good,"I had great co-workers some days were better than others the hardest part of the job had to be cleaning the theaters by picking up all the trash,putting all the arm rest up,and cleaning up spills etc..."
good,making popcorn and hotdogs in the morning for those who want it. did great at cleaning the theater. made great friends as co-workers. the hardest part was how busy and rude people get. the best part is when i get to watch free movies when i can.
good,"Large groups of people coming and going assisting customers and coworker when possible. Learned suggestive sale and upsizing. Management was sometimes involved not always when needed to be. Hardest part of job would be dealing with rude customers, rude managers and lazy coworkers. Most enjoyable part of job is seeing free movies."
good,"Compensation is far below what it should be. Hours are often all over the place. Some days you will open at 9am. This could be immediately after closing until 1am or even later. Can be a fun job, ESPECIALLY for those just starting out."
good,"Being an Assistant Manager for Regal Cinemas had many positive experiences. Responsibilities include management of salable and non-salable stock inventory, maintenance of staff hours and payroll, knowledge and practical application of Microsoft Office, and oversight of the daily operations of a movie theater (setting of movie times, cleaning of theaters and lobby, regular operation and maintenance of movie projectors, promotion and sale of inventory, motivation of staff, and primary facilitator of customer care). Given the amount of responsibility assistant managers have, my time was an overall pleasurable experience."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of cleaning the theatres, bathrooms, and overall building. Co-workers had to be instructed what floor positions they would perform and when to take their breaks. As the supervisor had to work other positions as well as my own to maintain good service among customers. I learned to work with a lot of customers as well as other co-workers. The managers were not really assertive and the supervisors in each position really took charge more than the managers. Most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to be working. Many people do not have jobs and was good experiance to lead people and make money. Hardest part of the job was resolving problems that went against the theatres own policies. It became hard to enforce the theatres rules while maintaing good customer relations. Learned to work under pressure and established good work procedures."
good,"I enjoyed working at the theater greatly. The people were great and easy to talk to as well as get along with. However, the lack of advancement and challenge quickly became apparent."
good,"Regal Ent. is a decent company to start out with if your just coming out of high school looking to put money in your pocket and just some short term work. Slim possibilities of advancement, constant payroll cuts tend to be very annoying! Again do not look to stay with this job for a long period of time...it will drain the life out of you!"
good,I loved the work environment. The coworkers were the best part managers were friendly. I felt like the pay was terrible for the work we did. The only benefits were free soda and popcorn only 1 free movie a week with a plus one.
good,Everyone started here at 16 but the management were all those people and never left. You can get stuck here. Do not get stuck. It's good while you're starting out and in school. During the summer you can save a butt load of money for the semester. During the semester it is really hard to work around finals and my classes but if you submit the availability asap you should have no problem.
good,Don't want to leave a review. Find out for yourself. It was fun while it lasted but making changes isn't easy. Mangers should be able to make progress obtainable.
good,"I've been working at Regal for 3.5 years, and while the job itself isn't difficult by any means, it can be very stressful and chaotic dealing with rude customers, constant rule changes (we were purchased by a company in the UK), and (at my location) a general manager with a very hostile personality, making for a very tense atmosphere at work. It's not unusual for closing shifts to end at 1am, and we're forced to do a lot of tedious maintenance work. Pay is a joke, although we just received a $1 raise to $8.75. Once upon a time, we used to get two free tickets a day. Now it's just two a week. This place isn't worth your time. Avoid unless you're desperate for work (and it is VERY easy to be hired at my location)."
good,The best part of this job comes by engaging with the staff members and helping customers. The not so good part is the corporate oversight on employees that in my and many of my managerial peers opinions may be too overbearing at times.
good,My biggest problem with this company was that they were almost always understaffed. They would cut people in the middle of their shift and then later on there would be a rush that we weren’t prepared for because of it or they didn’t except a rush so we were understaffed to begin with. It’s important that you know how to manage your time well when ushering because there could be multiple theaters finishing at the same time and they expect you to clean them all within a short amount of time. Also the company was recently bought out so they’re continuously making changes that make it harder for employees and customers which causes the customers to complain about the employees not doing a “good” job.
good,Pay scale is below what others offer. My location is closing but no info on when. Low staffing level and no support from corporate. Losing my love for the company.
good,This is a perfect job for when you're in high school and don't really have any bills to pay. It's fast pace but never nothing too over-whelmimng. Not necessarily a long term job.
good,"Regal is a great starter job and the flexible schedule is great for working while you attend school, the work is easy and the coworkers really make the work days pleasant for you. Benefits are slim to none, so I don't recommend Regal for a long-time job, even in a manager position, but it is great if you're looking for a dependable and easy job to get some extra money on the side."
good,"The company being bought by a British cinema company did NOT help matters. General manager was lazy and incompetent, but other, lesser managers are extremely kind and helpful."
good,"I have a disability which makes working this kind of place a little difficult for me, but if your looking for a challenge for yourself then this is the right place for you"
good,During the summer the customers were crazy and the place was super busy. When it wasn't super busy then it was super boring. Management needs to work on respecting the workers more.
good,"Overall work at Regal was easy but also not made for everyone. From constant movement back and forth from stations, to absurd and out of line patrons. Similar to an assembly line, upon recognition, everything runs smooth. However there will always be minor roadblocks that must be overcome with swiftness and elegance. The standout at Regal was the team of employees you work with. Without them the job is not worth while, mediocre management and a workload to grand for little compensation."
good,"Some managers really try, and some are just there for the paycheck-which isn't very good. A coworker at another job I had suggested working here, so I filled out a job application. There was a normal interview process and everything went good. Then they didn't follow up because they apparently ""lost"" my application. My coworker asked if I still wanted the job so I went in and redid everything. I worked my way up from floor staff to management and transferred to a different center, so I got a first hand account of some of the questionable management practices that went on. They realized they ""forgot"" to do my yearly review when I got promoted, for example. This job will be nothing but a stepping stone for most people."
good,"Regal was a way to start working as a teen, very flexible but the pay was not the best, management were okay but needed improvement, You are also working more then what you are getting paid."
good,"Over the first year everything ran very smoothly. Everyone gets to know each other and you can always rely on your coworkers for help. Management was good until the company was bought out. Now with being over staffed and poor management, it is harder to earn a decent salary."
good,"This was my first official job working in a retail environment. The hiring process was simple and fairly easy. I worked in all positions in Floor Staff including: Concessions, Box Office, and Usher. In the beginning it was a decent place to work at, a bit overwhelming since it was my first job and also getting hired around the time big named movies were coming out, but I soon adjusted to the fast pace environment. If you are comfortable with standing, moving, bending, and lifting for 8 hours then this is the job for you. This job has definitely thickened my skin when dealing with customers and not taking what they do and say to heart. It did also teach me patience and to always leave a positive impression on customers since we've all been one at some point right? The free movie ticket benefits really came in clutch especially if your are a hardcore movie fan/moviegoer. After I was working there for over 3 months, I started to notice certain attitudes that some managers had towards their employees which didn't make it much of positive environment to work at. Other managers however were extremely welcoming and helpful which is good to have for a first time worker who don't fully know the ropes of customer service and since the majority of workers are high school student as well. Overall, regardless of the good and bad things that occurred there, I'm glad I was able to learn something from this job that I've carried over to other aspects of my life."
good,Depending on the position that was on the schedule you would go clock in and just start helping the customers or your coworkers. The hardest part of the job would be when it was closing time and we needed to clean all the equipment and restock all the food.
good,I been with the company for a while before the New merger and then issues arose with what the new Corporate wanted and how effective the new strategies worked within the United States. New Policy Changes were needed but ones that could be most effective in the United States.
good,"While flexible, my schedule was anywhere from 8 hours a week to 25, with little to no predictability. Pay was minimum wage, as expected, but the ability to advance beyond that was all but nonexistent and occurred rarely, usually for employees of 3+ years."
good,"Customer service based job, fast paced when busy, constantly cleaning, opportunities to advance, though don't enter management if you don't plan to continue moving up because you will be forced to keep moving up or loose your position. Hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers and having little say in how things are done due to corporate micro-managing."
good,"When I first started at Regal, I really loved the work that we were doing, and I wanted to advance in the company. Shifts flew by because we were always busy. I liked the managers and liked the opportunities that I thought were available. Unfortunately, when I did become a manager, I was only part time. I was not on a fixed amount of hours for the week and there were no real training systems in place. It was hard for me to see myself as a full time manager when all the full time managers had no plans of moving up. It was a rare occurrence: a full time manager moving up. There were also great programs for staff and part time mangers like an intern program that would take certain part times to HQ. Employees who received ""Star performer of the month"" would get and extra $25 on their pay checks. We were recently bought out by another company, who acknowledged that struggle of moving up, and the lack of training. Because of the changes, the Star performer program got put on hold, but I think it will be revamped and return soon."
good,"At Regal Cinemas you will see many customer and have to interact, greet or assist throught the facility through a work shift. This isn't the type of position if you are shy or nervous around others."
good,"Overall, it was a good job. However, as I tried to move up in the ranks, I was bluntly stopped by things that were out of my hands and downright unfair. I never moved up even though I had the intention to all this time and I was never recognized for how much effort and time I had put into the company. I would always stress just to ensure people had amazing visits but nobody ever gave their two cents. It was detrimental for me and that is solely the reason why I’m leaving. I need to find a place that will accept and entertain my valiant work efforts and powerful work ethic and leadership. I need to go somewhere to where I can access my full potential without being stopped by powers that be."
good,"Clock in, stock anything that is needed to be stocked, clean the counters and equipment. Concessions - serve customers their drinks/food they've ordered. Box Office- serve customers their tickets. Usher- tear tickets and direct customers towards their theatre. Theatre checks and cleaning theatre before next showing."
good,"Working for regal was hard work and dedication to say the least. It’s a lot of things to do at once, but once you get it down you’re good. Focus on your work and no one else’s."
good,"Go to my station and set up the ""Atom"" ticket code scanner for customers coming in. Cleaning movie theaters and changing the trash out after every show. Free Movies and Icee's were the best."
good,"Regal is a relaxed work place for the most part. On busy days, it can start to get difficult to keep up and the pay isn't worth it for busy days. Over all it's a decent job to get through high school."
good,Quiet slow paced and lots of standing. A typical day in the plant feels longer than it actually is. It was a temp assignment for me however I did not plan on staying once the assignment was completed
good,"working at regal was relaxed work with different rates depending in the day. the managers were nice, but lacked communication among employers who worked there"
good,"Relaxed, but fast paced at times. Met tons of friends. Great and easy way to build experience with the public and customer service. Opportunities for advancement. Great company to work for prior to new foreign company buying out Regal. New company standards of cleanliness are outlandish and impossible to achieve. Corporate has little to no regard for it's lower tier employees. Overall, good job, good experience, subpar pay, even more subpar executives."
good,A typical day at regal is very entertaining and busy. There will be several rushes of customers and always helping if not on register then in the back cooking or the hallways making sure things are clean.
good,"You work in rushes, customers are often rude and feel entitled, management can be lacking, overall the job feels like a water off time. There is a lot of room for advancement and can be achieved quickly though."
good,"If you are a student or a younger person looking for a temporary job, this is the place for you. It does come with free movies to watch on your break, and you can get free tickets to shows."
good,"As an usher you sweep and clean the theaters."
good,I think that working here was okay. I worked my butt off constantly and I don’t think I got much recognition for it but others did. And if it wasn’t good enough the managers have a problem with you and are really unprofessional and unpleasant about it
good,This job was a lot to handle because you had to know so many different positions instead of one set one but over pretty good. I’m glad it wasn’t a long job but it worked out while I needed it.
good,"Aside from the GM and a few managers, everyone is part time. This means no benefits and not great pay. We have variable shifts and a high turnover rate."
good,"I've been a floorstaff worker at Regal 3 years now, and its a decent job as far as minimum wage jobs go. There's a high turnover rate because a lot of employees are students. Co-workers are generally very nice, you get free movie tickets and 1/2 off all concessions. You get an hour of sick time for every 30 hours you work, once you've been there 6 months. You have to be willing to work weekends and holidays, and hours are late, usually you get out by midnight but if you're the closing usher you might be stuck till 1 or even a little later. It's always either really busy or really slow."
good,"Working for the company for almost 7 years and it still seems like corporate and GMs are on two different pages. Would recommend as a starting job, wouldn’t recommend hopping into management."
good,"Working here was stressful and it was difficult to receive time off. It was easy to work there and you got free movies so that was a plus, other than that I would not particularly recommend working here."
good,Fun place to work but not a serious job at all. Free movies is nice but really someone shouldn't seek a career here. managers play favorites which can effect the amount of hours you have.
good,Good place to work for a high school student. fun people and easy work. Easily adjustable hours an request off. Slow days are very slow but busy days are very busy.
good,I truly believe that no worker has worked in a fast paced(non restaurant) environment until they've worked for a movie theatre! The shifts go by so quickly because you get so busy for hours on end. This is a great job to start with because it's fun and you learn a lot about customer service and FREE MOVIES!! but the room for advancement and the pay is very very poor.
good,Regal Entertainment Group It a good company considering the nature of its business. It has a good culture that is enjoyable to be a part of and relaxed and management is understanding and does not lord over you. The only issue is the work are bad because you it closes at 11:00 and you need to stay later to clean and don't usually leave until 12:00 at least .
good,"*typical day, you would either work in the concessions area, ticket stand, go usher in theaters, or sell tickets in the box office."
good,"Spartan 16 was my first job I was 16 when I started and it was a great job to have during high school. Spartan 16 didn't have any benefits or anything so after high school, I went to a different job."
good,"Who I work with personally is friendly enough, it's not often that I feel like I have to watch my mouth around someone. The reason why I would like to leave is that the job pays peanuts, if I would be paid the same as someone who was hired in with me, regardless of work ethic and I really don't like being nice to rude people."
good,Regal has an extraordinary team but needs better management as well as members of staff aren't really appreciated as much as they should. Regal is a great start for a first job but nothing long term.
good,"I worked at a slower building. Sometimes it was too relaxed. Which makes an  easy job for floor staff. The management needs to be looked at a little closer by the higher-ups, specifically the GM. Once that is handled, the theatre would improve 10 fold."
good,"Typical day would be cleaning the theaters, taking out the trash, working the concession stand. Management generally did well but there was times where lack of leadership was present. During the weak it is relaxed but on the weekends and when there are new movies, it gets very busy and very chaotic. Your always on your feet so its important to have comfortable shoes. Also, you have to be a good communicator are always constantly interacting with guest."
good,"The people who worked hard and cared about their job were treated poorly or let go to give more hours to the lazy, slow, off task workers who had been with the company for a longer period of time. A lot of favoritism and bias. Unpleasant managers who treated you badly because you were a new hire."
good,"Regal was an interesting place to work.  It can go from being very slow to very busy throughout the week.  It's culture allows for a quick change of pace with an upcoming big film or Oprah night.  Work will keep you on your toes and ask you to cover a lot of ground if need be.  It is asked that you keep pace and are always busy, but it's worth it if you want those free movies."
good,"i enjoyed the job for the most part but hours got cut frequesntly based on movie-goer attendance; if it was slow, you'd most likely get sent home early"
good,"they work great around your work schedule. Great if you are a part time student. However, there is absolutely no pay increase what so ever unless you are a manager."
good,"I learned how to effectively multitask and learned exceptional customer service skills. Each work day would consistent of a multitude of tasks, the amount of which surpasses other part-time jobs while receiving the same pay. The turn over rate of employees was high as the environment proved to be stressful with few rewarding experiences or praise from staff."
good,"During my time at regal valuable job experience was gained. Job experience that could have been gained anywhere. The job was not particularly demanding nor was there information needed to be learned past the beginning. The guidelines were strict, but easy to follow and the there was never enough floor staff or managers. It is an accessible first job, and that is the best thing about it."
good,"I was taught, if you do not have anything nice to say then do not say anything at all. So, there is nothing nice that I have to say therefore I have nothing to say, except this."
good,This is a good job if you're just beginning to work. Sometimes management expected too much out of you when the job kind of sucked and you're making minimum wage.
good,"The management is friendly but they pick favorites and you will not always work in the position you originally requested. At three months you will be given a raise, depending on how well you have done while working there. The location is right near a food court but you will still only get a 40 minute break (15 minutes if working under 6 hours)."
good,"You could never tell how your day is going to look, but I was always full of adrenaline and ready for the rush. I loved my job and my returning customers."
good,I gained employment with Regal when I was fresh out of high school and I happily spent 3 years there. It was a great opportunity to polish my customer service skills. Definitely this is a great job for those who are just starting out.
good,I was harassed while working at Regal. I filed complaints multiple times and asked to not be scheduled with the boys harassing me but nothing was done. They were also harassing another girl who quit shortly after me. The last straw was my car being stolen from the parking lot. The boys who were harassing me took the keys from my locker (no locks provided) and left with my car. 2 managers  talked to the boys but no incident report was filed.
good,Working at regal was a love/ hate type deal. i love working their in the the summer's when it was busy but the winters were so dead. its really to move their most of the time they play favorites
good,I enjoy working at regal cinema. Not only are the managers caring and easy to talk to but the people they hire/employ are just as friendly. Weekends get extremely busy and hectic but apart from that it's a productive and fun work environment.
good,"Mostly fun, but if only you can work well with your coworkers. The management isn't all that great as well. That's why coworkers would be beneficial to this job. Closing can be a pain in the behind since we usually finish closing around 2 in the morning."
good,The work is fairly simple customers just make it a bad experience along with certain managers. Like many of the customers are very indecisive and don't know what they want and assume we can read minds.
good,"In this company there is little room for growth, although you have fun working here because you get to see free movies and meet new people since they are always hiring."
good,A typical day at work was communicating with my co-workers. I have learned that patience is key. Management was okay. My co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was leaving late because their were not enough individuals on the night shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was free movies and half off snacks.
good,"When I first joined the regal team, I was 16 years old. It was cool and fun and easy to do. You meet different people all day long and that's the exciting part! But now I am 18 and two years later, I must say it has been a great experience but now i'm advanced for the job. So its a little tiring and boring after awhile."
good,"I enjoy the cinema feel and the excitement when a new movie comes out."
good,"Unable to move up, No pay raise. Does not follow food handlers rules. Etc. grabbing food without gloves or sticking hand in popcorn to taste it."
good,regal was a good place to work but it doesn't treat their employees as they should be treated all the time. they fail to give raises to people who deserve them
good,"I normally enjoyed being at work. It was a well paste job, I'd help customers through my whole shift and have conversations with them about the movies they'd be watching and see what they think about their visit at Regal Cinemas."
good,"Easy going job most days."
good,It was a good experience for me. The management is quite fair on breaks and the employees you work with are really nice and friendly
good,"While working at Regal Entertainment Group I learned a lot about customer service and sales.  Typical day at work would include interacting with customers, cleaning and maintaining the theater, and working with cash registers.  Mangement was okay and had it's ups and downs.  Co-workers were typically younger, which led to an immature environment that pushed me away from Regal Entertainment Group."
good,"Regal Cinema, is a great work environment. I work for Regal for four years. it was a good experience working with Regal. The only problem is there policy. It is designed for the employer favor not employees meaning any mistakes that an employees makes no matter whether if there fault or not it still pinned on the employees. Regal cinema is a entry level position in which it is very hard to get promoted within the organization."
good,Fast paced environment . Can be stressful with long hours especially around the summertime and holidays. But overall fun atmosphere to work at . Supportive managers and great co-workers.
good,it is a good place to work but there isnt alot on the table for advancement and some managers treat the staff like the dirt under there feet.
good,Co- workers were great to work with. Management was reasonable. Was not a lot of room to progress with the company. Not many hours where given despite requests for more hours.
good,the policies were kind of strict and they had long hours standing on my feet with little to no brake but i like my co-workers and the job wasnt hard but the work place was hot. but i learned how to talk to coustomers and keep them happy and how to talk credit for my mistakes.
good,Working here wasn't too bad. I gave them an average rating because it's not great or awful. There were a lot of employees here so it was easy to make friends with each other.
good,Lots of hours when big movies come out. The job requires very little mental compacity and easy to zone out. I did enjoy working with the other employees but people are slobs in movie theaters and its hard to clean up after everyone. Taking peoples tickets was the best part when customers were friendly. They offer very little reward for working years with the company. but a good part time job when going to college.
good,"Constantly on feet, short breaks, young co-workers, management is also young, hardest part is trying to get others to work as a team, most enjoyable part is free movie tickets."
good,"It was alright, it's not very hard but doing things correctly the first time makes a huge difference. I recommend it for people who like movies"
good,"Regal Entertainment Group Cinemas provides a good starting experience for job culture, having a friendly atmosphere and productive work environment, which provides good experience. As a long-term job prospect however it suffers, due to lack of meaningful benefits and little opportunity for advancement, depending on location."
good,"Good job for a teenager going through school, but it is very wearing seeing that the prices are outrageous and the customers aren't afraid to take their anger out on you. It was a good experience, but it's time to move on."
good,"It was fun working at Regal Cinema, met great team members. And, management was great.."
good,"great place to learn about movies"
good,"great co-workers, good hours, most enjoyable part would be working with co-workers"
good,Top circuit in the business - keeps you moving fast and thinking on your feet.
good,"Management was not that good and job security was poor. They treated people more like kids instead of adults. We got write ups for having your phone out, not suggesting items to guest etc. This company is very bureaucratic. they will fire you over the smallest thing."
good,"If I worked during the week, my duties were light. Weekends were a different story, especially if you worked at night. Management was great,but sometimes, they weren't always available for problem solving. Co-workers were nice, but it was alot of teens, who were always texting,or complaining about high school problems. "
good,The managers at Regal take their jobs to literally and expect too much of minimum wage employees.
good,Regal Entertainment Group is a great place to work for a first job while in high school. It gives the individuals a foot in the door to other opportunities once they have learned basic functions like running a cash register and what is need to run a business.
good,"pretty busy, even in a down economy. pay is not great. expect to be on your feet and dealing with unruly customers who've just spent over $100 to take their family out."
good,I have worked for Regal for 7 years and I have been a manager for 5 years. I have enjoyed working there but I am ready for something new. I have learned some great leadership skills. A typical day for me would be opening the theatre and getting things ready for the start of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the perk of free movies.
good,This is a great starting job for perspective employees. The company is very flexible for college students' schedules and quickly advances valued employees to management level.
good,"Typically working at Regal I either sell tickets, promote our loyalty card, serve food products, or clean up theaters. In the five years working for Regal I've learned the ups and downs of theater management. Between the two theaters I've worked in I wouldn't trade my co-workers for anyone else. They've truly become my family. The hardest part of the job is the lack of advancement, knowing you can do your best but won't be recognized for your hard work. I love the customer service aspect of my job. I love working with people, striking up conversations, and getting to know my regulars. I love helping people."
good,popping popcorn waiting for the customers orders helping out my fellow employees by cleaning theatres together
good,A typical day would start with opening task of making sure every dish or machine is properly clean. The making sure you enough stock to hold up for you whole shift if not a stock sheet is available to you. The hardest part is when you get an overwhelming amount of customers for a movie premier.
good,"I worked there for a few months and the time I was there alot of the employees were very disrespectful and dishonest, I had a few things stolen from me and other employees. Manager staff was the best part about this job."
good,Paid minimum with a lot of work. Managers where fun to work with. Coworkers were really nice. Customers can sometimes be too much. Pay was too little.
good,"A lot of the work is repetitive and can get really boring, especially on slower days. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing and talking to the customers that have had good experiences. Management overall could be better, especially when it comes to making the schedules"
good,This is a corporation focused on making has much money as possible. The life of the employee was not a concern of theirs.    If you want to work a corporate job it is easily accessible in this compny
good,A good group of people to work with. Good hours not much pay but a good first job. I personally loved it I just had to much going on at the time so I couldn’t stay
good,This job was not very well rounded and was hard to enjoy it was also not very fair with pay and things changed a lot with what needed to happen. However I have not worked there in a while so it very likely could have changed.
good,Fun job for high school students to learn how a job really works. Helpful in time management because of the interesting working hours that cater to the movie times.
good,This is a great job if you are looking for a part-time job. The job is very fast and have to be able to handle customers in any situation. Overall this was an awesome summer job for me.
good,"The job is busy on opening days for popular movies and could be slow on other days. Decent variety of things to do: cashier, clean up, food prep, ushering, ticket tear but you mostly will either be an usher or cashier. Nothing is too difficult but I've seen people complain of boredom one day and wishing it wasn't so busy the next. Most management is good but you occasionally get bad ones. The hardest part is occasionally getting your hands dirty especially cleaning restrooms. The main thing during shifts is to keep busy and ultimately was a decent starter job until I get my degree and move on."
good,N/a  i do not get this part . But some tips if you do work  dont moss days or get sick  they will write you up  or cite you for it  and you dont receive sick hours unless you earn them i think
good,Regal plainly stated what was expected from you and that is what you were evaluated on. Management was courteous and helpful. Regal maintained and fun for customers as well as staff.
good,The only difficult part if this job is putting stock away and that's only on Tuesdays. There's not much to do on a normal day so it's primarily just sitting around waiting on someone to come in
good,If you opened you had to start popping popcorn and cooking food for when customers start coming in. It felt as though the managers didn't really see us like people.  They would cut people (send them home for the day) to save money and then we would end up needing those people because we get a rush.
good,"If you're looking to make friends, this isn't for you. Every coworker there doesn't care much about you other than you doing your job and staying out of their way. And nobody wants to cover your shift when you want to ask someone to cover for you so you can do something important"
good,"This place is very easy to work. The environment is very friendly and inviting. The benefits, however, are not the best. You do get two free tickets a week (it used to be two a day) and half of concessions."
good,"When they draw you in with the allure of easy tasks, just when you hit the ripe age of 18 is when the odd jobs start. In addition to normal cast member obligations, I have been a painter, contracter, carpenter, heavy detail cleaner, construction worker, and much more. Would recommend to anyone of the female gender who is under the age of 18, if you are a male over the age of 18 avoid this job. On top of all of this, the communication from management to cast member is borderline non existent, unless it's a new rule your managers don't want to get pegged on you will most likely not hear about it."
good,"was a long time ago dont remeber much about this place , other than i was always busy and on my feet. fast pace location. good employees friendly  people"
good,"This is a good place to work for a first job however they are short staffed most of the time and I was closing on school nights around 1:00am. This was a very hard job to keep up good school work and mental health because of the constant closing shifts. The managers were outstanding which is why I stayed and I did learn a lot about food handling, customer service, working with money, deep cleaning, and closing and opening. Once you turn 18, positions for management open up and seemed reasonable for advancing. In a typical day there were many times where there are rushes of people and you are very busy but there are also down times between movies . It was a manageable and fun job other than my constant closing shifts on school nights."
good,they're usually well under staffed and the auditoriums and still dirty from time to time. customer service is sometimes a hassle and there napkins are rarely stocked.
good,Management is very unorganized. Employees play around too much at work and don’t take job seriously (majority of employees are high school or college students).
good,"The duties required are not inherently difficult but there is little to no room for mistakes and when mistakes are made there is no guidance from superiors to correct such mistakes. The culture is hectic and the environment is always busy. There are several instances where individuals, including minors, were not given their legally required break."
good,"A typical day at work would include sweeping floors, giving good customer service, selling concessions products, organizing and stocking concessions products, and deep cleaning everything at the end of the night."
good,"I enjoyed this job until Cineworld bought Regal out. I quit soon after as the company changed for the worse. They later demoted the managers and the vp resigned. They cut down employee benefits as well. In addition, several good managers quit and were replaced by poor substitutes. Eventually a ring of poor managers created a culture of unfair favoritism that damaged employee productivity."
good,If you have to work on the weekends and schedule to close you need to remember that you'll be closing at a late hours and won't leave the place until  midnight which is insane for students that do part time at a movie theater.
good,I Worked their as a Server/Cashier for a year. Working at the concession I have to close most weekend nights and it's really unfair since the VIP people get tips and leave early whereas the concessionist have to stay extra late (sometimes 'til 3am if a blockbuster comes out) and are forbidden to receive any tips. Plus Regal is bought into a bigger European corporation making it extremely stressful for the managers. Hard to enjoy the work environment after that change. We used to have 2 free employee  movie tickets everyday and they decided to reduced it to 2 tickets/week. Cheap move!
good,"I had the job when I was in High school, which was perfect. One of the perks was free movie tickets and so that was a bonus for working with them. And it's not much but the lunch break was a 35 minute break, so you had a few extra minutes to eat or sit down."
good,Management team is very understanding and helpful. Regal only hires through a temporary hiring agency. It takes no less than 3 months to get hired on full-time. No benefits until 1 year after the hire on date. Clean workplace with willing to work and help co-workers.
good,"Even though the pay is not that great, and it is hard to be full-time unless you are manager, it was a nice experience working here. I have made some really close friends from this job and the work environment can be a lot of fun."
good,"Keep stuff clean, don't lick the popcorn, don't have your phone on you (even if it's off). Somehow, there being nothing to do will be stressful for you."
good,Pretty laid back I worked with one other person cleaning overnights 10 theaters bathroom's carpet vacuuming.  I was my own boss it was 7 days a week but worth the money
good,"It's been a while since I worked here, I don't understand why indeed really needs a review from me. But it was fine, I worked there over the summer and used the money to pay a bit of college."
good,"i would say my time at regal was really fun and i would definitely Redmond this job to others, the benefits are pretty and nice. supervisors were amazing but higher up management was a bit degrading to lower employees."
good,Management was lazy and didn’t help as often as needed and the benefits were zero to none but the work environment was worth the extra work cause we created our own little family
good,"This location transitioned through 3 different owners while I was there. The first didn't like spending money and found ways to get things done as inexpensively as possible, Regal had the attitude of making the customer happy, but the newest owner seems to be focused on minimalism and cleanliness rather than customer service."
good,"Concession stands tend to get super busy and they often tend to only place 3 employees on the stands on super busy days and rarely do upper managers help. Ushers are constantly on the move typically by themselves and the expectations are difficult to reach in 7 minutes given to clean theaters, door members are expected to clean on free time but can not move their area and expected to stand still on feet for several hours, box members get super cold and are prohibited from bringing their own jackets or sweaters. 35 minute lunch and if you go under or over by a minute you receive a write up. Overall, the company is very harsh and set high expectations for a job that is primarily for many young students, offer no help and are not understanding at all when it comes to school as a priority."
good,"Working here was good and bad. Overall though, I was happy to work with many different people and get to know a lot of them. The management team was split but solid."
good,"A typical day for me would be, waiting on a customer, making popcorn and clean off the counters, or ripping off tickets depending on where they have me working that day."
good,"Regal Entertainment Group has flexible hours, and require employees to work all holidays and weekends. Pay is low and raises are done in annual reviews, never exceeding 25 cent increase."
good,I enjoyed working in the kitchen and making food. Concession was boring but the job is easy and fun sometimes. I met lots of different people. I didn't hate it all the time.
good,"It’s pretty relaxed, few busy moments, lots of standing and lacks of breaks. You can only get breaks if you really ask for one mid shift, you’re constantly on your feet. It’s long and tiring,"
good,"Most of my management were considerate and I got along well with them, but the managers working at Regal for too long are insensitive to your life events. Even as a first job the pay is not nearly enough for your work, even as a minor. Your discounts will include free movies for you and a friend, and half off on 8 concession items per day. The company was recently bought by another, larger company that is making changes that are unsuitable for young staff such as closing times being, on average at 2am."
good,it just isnt a job for someone over the age of 19 its not a bad job or a hard one just isnt enough if you have real bills to pay. other then that its a fun place to work
good,"help customer find there why to the theater, make sure everything is clean inside the theaters, worked the food concession and ticket sales, up sales to costumers, management helps you a lot in situation you don't understand, The job only got hard if you made it hard, the enjoyable part where be around the people and employees."
good,Flexible schedule for all employees. Strong management within the individual facilities. Good working relationship between management and subordinates.
good,Average company to work for. Somewhat cares about employees. Free movies and popcorn were always a plus. Easy job to work and low risk responsibilities.`
good,"Perfect if you're just starting out in the workforce, such as a high schooler. Stressful environment, but your work day depends on who your manager is."
good,Management sucks but floor staff is always fun to work with. Get free movies and get private screenings which are kinda fun to do but super late at night
good,"It was an easy part time job that provided decent hours. Never very hard work, just basic. Nobody seemed too passionate about what they are doing, as other than some of the managers, most people have goals outside of working at a theater. That being said, there are a lot worse low paying jobs."
good,I would open going in early and starting by turning on all the machines. starting up the first batch of popcorn and putting the hotdogs on the grill. setting up the candy racks and unlocking the ice cream containers. turning on the fryers and letting the ovens heat up. then  I would start up my cash register computer and count the money to 300. then we would unlock the doors and start the day most of the time it was just me in the concession.  I would have to cook the food in the back while keeping an eye on the front and serve and ring them out.
good,"Recorded general entries for reporting all cash and credit sales receipts"
good,Pretty flexible. I just didnt like 1 manager because he was very selfish and rude and didnt really care to  help his employees. Otherwise it was fun. My coworkers were cool and on breaks I would sneak in the back of a movie and watch a little bit of it. Concessions can get stressful during holidays. Very much a team effort.
good,I liked working at Regal the managers could be kind of insuler but my coworkers were nice and we could watch movies for free. It could be kind of slow sometimes.
good,"I think for first time employees, working at Regal is a manageable job. Decent hours and co-workers usually are good to work with. However, it can be a bit much when dealing with customers on busy days."
good,Good money and they are fast working . They give you good hours at first and then they start to cut them ... I enjoyed it tho the free movie and drinks
good,"fun place to work when provided with enough help. 50% off food at food stand free movies up to 2 a day. learned how to deal with time based tasks that require cooperation/ teamwork. hardest part of job is keeping up with the tasks given on busier days when not enough people were scheduled for that day, most enjoyable is when we have special events that engage a competitive nature."
good,"It's just a minimum wage job mostly in the food service industry like pretty much any other, when it's busy it's awful and can be stressful and enjoyment essentially comes down to coworkers and managers."
good,"Typical usher job; worked concessions, usher, etc."
good,This was also a summer job that I had the same time as another job. Looking back on it it was easy and the perks were great like two free movie tickets a week or free drinks and popcorn and posters.
good,"Not my cup of tea, but a great place to meet people. I loved all the different movies that we would show in our theater, it all brought people together. But the hassel and the rude costumers got to be too much. I resigned and moved to Florida."
good,Regal Entertainment Group is my current employer and is a high paced environment to work. It required my flexibility and long time industry knowledge.
good,"As a part-time job its great, fairly stress free and easy work. After I got promoted to part-time associate manager I was extremely overworked and did not get the proper tutelage necessary in order to grow and succeed."
good,It was nice if you got along with everyone but at my theater it was all about drama. There was so much bullbutter it felt like high school and thats mostly because most of the other employees were still in high school.
good,"I did not like the managers, they were not very helpful and didnt do their job very well. The pay was minimum wage for no chance at advancement. I did like the freedom in ushering."
good,This job was great for during or right after high school. Was easy to do and little responsibility besides cleaning and being able to get drinks and popcorn for customers.
good,"Working at Regal is okay. The hours aren't that great, and there are virtually no benefits unless you're a manager. The pay is also minimum wage, and the raises aren't very much. The good thing is the staff is always great and the movie discounts are nice."
good,I've worked there for 6yrs and never thought I was going to leave but it's time for a change for me. From being an employee I became a manager which I've loved to do. I've learned to work with cash more and more
good,"It is an easy job for those with no job experience. You learn a lot about customer service and how to handle money. It is a good first job, you are given a lot of opportunities to learn."
good,It was a fine job it didn't require much effort. It was messy and not ideal but it was good enough as a first job to understand retail life and entering the working world.
good,"Pay is not nearly as much as it should be. Benefits are lack luster, management is nice and helpful though. For a high school kid or freshman in college this is a good job, but past that it is not."
good,"Over the five years I worked there I got to work in the different departments. Such as concessions, Usher, and Box office. I had great management that trusted out and helped you out."
good,"Regal overall was a fun and educational place to be employed at. The work enviable the coworkers are what made it a great place to work. Some managers and the GM however made it a stressful work environment which I found odd. Working in a movie theater should be a fun place to work, and the effect of some managers and the GM had on the people who worked there would reflect in their work. Being constantly serveyed and others being favorites, it wasn't a great place to work all the time."
good,"Free movies, free movie posters, popcorn, concession discounts, but pretty dull and menial. Things get a little more fulfilling when you reach management, but still not the best."
good,"good for a first time job. free soda and popcorn on lunches, gave no breaks. free movies on off days. busy during movie premiers, have to be able to work fast and efficient!"
good,Working at Regal you interact with every type of customer you can get. Regal is a very fast paced environment because guests want everything now so they aren't late for movies. You also have many guests trying to scam you. The hardest part of the job is being prepared for anything that can come at you and knowing what situations are more urgent. You need to know how to balance yourself with what comes at you as well as trying to have the best positive outcome. The most enjoyable part is getting free movies everyday.
good,"I was introduced into a new position of leadership where I would have to resolve issues, promote our theater, get more involved with the community to bring in more business, and build a strong and successful staff."
good,Some managers attended to have some attitudes. However it did not affect the way I worked on the floor I gained a lot of customer service skills. I enjoyed my seasonal position as a usher.
good,"A typical day at work is pretty easy, the longer you spend there the easier it is to pick up what you have to do. My only forewarning is costumers can be challenging occasionally so it is important to have tough skin in costumer service jobs in general."
good,I had outstanding coworkers but as a company Regal typically does not increase wages with cost of living. No benefits were available and limited opportunities for career advancement.
good,Haven't worked there since 2009. Typical day included just minding all the theaters and being friendly to the moviegoers. Working during off-peak hours was enjoyable.
good,"While this company offers a multitude of menial incentives such as free movie tickets, posters, discounts on concessions and free popcorn, there is much to be desired everywhere else. The pay in not competitive with most floor staff making $7.50-$8.50 an hour and managers making $10-$12 an hour. With the responsibilities that the company requires of it's staff, the pay should be scaled to represent those expectations. The culture is very exciting with new movies coming out all the time and being able to meet wonderful people in the theatre itself, this is the reason most people would want to stick around. They most importantly need to address promotions within the  company and focus on investing in dedicated employees."
good,It was okay. I would recommend this job to anyone for a first job. If it was better management I would of stayed there. Great place for new beginnings.
good,"Love free movies? I do! Worked back when it was film being played, loved doing projection. Training staff and kicking people out for shenanigans were always fun. Become a part of a small family."
good,it wasn't very interesting some of the managers played favorites.  they don't give overtime pay. they limited people to not many hours. i wouldn't want to stay here for long
good,A typical day working at regal can be either boring and slow and or very busy during holidays. Working there you learn to work with different age groups and also you learn about the film industry and up to date movie entertainment. I'm not too fond of management there. The most fun and best part of working there was the discount on snacks and free movie tickets everyday.
good,"This job Teaches you the basics of a food and beverage operation. There were four jobs we would rotate through: concessions, box office, ticket/director, and usher."
good,"Many of the floor staff were gossipy and disrespected management, whilst many of the managers were fraternizing with the floor staff. The place was chaotic and dirty, but it wasn't much more than what I'd expect to experience working at a movie theater."
good,good place to work just lack of hours.managers are good could use more urgency when customers need to talk to one but besides that the free movies is great plus and discount is good on food.
good,"I've worked at Regal for a couple of years, and it's a pretty good job for someone to start out on. However, depending on the level of business of the theater that you work at, minimum wage isn't quite a fair wage to make at the job. Plus, the yearly raise is usually only a few cents (mine was 12 cents, so I made 8.37 by the second year) Customers are rude, your job entails a lot of dirty work (including cleaning dirty restrooms, picking up vomit, picking up garbage, etc), and management can tend to have extreme favoritism that can negatively affect your work attitude. "
good,this was my first corporate job out of high school and it set up the building blocks for better opportunities. Fun place to work but the pay and lack of benefits were the down side
good,Working concessions and cleaning up theaters as well as dealing with the occasional rude customer was a typical day at Regal. I learned how to operate a Point Of Sale system as well as the importance of a clean work station. The work place was mostly kids in college or still in high school and I got to learn what it was like to have a first job with a group of my peers. The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely the free movies that every employee gets.
good,"The buildings need some upgrading but the theatres themselves are comfortable. A typical day can be anything from slow, a few customers at a time, to incredibly busy where it feels like there is no break. Management could always use improvement and the hardest part of the job is not making ""simple mistakes"" that all people can make, cause we're human, and dealing with irate customers. For the most part, we do treat each other like family - depending on the management, and it is a friendly place to work. Customer service is key at every Regal location."
good,Working for Regal as a corporation is not terrible. But the theatre that I worked at had terrible management. Most of the time no one really knew what was going on and the management didn't know how to properly motivate the staff. We would often be told that our job isn't hard and that we should be doing better than we are.
good,"This company is good a company to work for and they offer many perks for their employees such as free movies. However, as a manager this company expects a lot out of you like long hours. Night shift can go til 2 am."
good,"A typical day at Regal was pretty hectic. Once the day picked up we would sometimes be working several straight hours with no breaks in order to ensure the guests got into their theaters to enjoy the show. This was the first job I've ever held so it taught me to be more efficient as well as making sure the guest/customer was always taken care of. As I mentioned earlier, the culture in the workplace was pretty hectic but having a great team around you helps make everything easier. The hardest part was trying to keep pace with the crowd. What I enjoyed most about working at Regal was being able to see free movies of course!"
good,This is a job for people that are at the age of 16-17 that are looking for a first time job. The staff is always friendly and welcome. It is a great learning experience.
good,"Typical day at work includes normal shift duties depending on designation as Kitchen or Usher"
good,Regal cinemas was my first official employer. I worked part-time while in highschool and developed my strong work ethic while employed within the company.
good,Training could be better.  Learned a lot about myself.  Gained new knowledge daily about the company and its rumor cauldron.  Unhealthy work environment.  Management wasn't approachable.
good,"Lots of manager drama, because most of the managers are very young and immature. Most people don't want to be there but when the right crew is at work it's a good time"
good,very fun.  you meet great people. love the smell of popcorn. love watching free movies. love working the box office. learned a lot about the film industry.
good,"Easy-going work environment, can do concessions or work the booth where you rip tickets and clean theaters. Good management, and nice about scheduling while going to school."
good,Deal with rude customers but the staff was friendly.  The management team was good and I would go back and work for them again.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with prejudice customers
good,"Regal is a great place to work if its your first job as far as a career, unless your looking to be a GM or go Corporate...your not making much as just a manager."
good,Good people to work around except for managers. Most enjoyable part of the job was the relaxation.Hardest part of the job was the big time rushes but otherwise is really slow.
good,Very fast paced. Doors close on most nights at 11 but that is subject to change if more shows are added. You can get as late as 2am. Only enjoyable if you work with the right people.
good,"Working at regal, was a fun experience the employees and customers make the job worth while. Management needs improvement, as well as an increase in pay."
good,The company itself is good to its employees. There was a abundance of labor hours.  There was no set schedule however.  If you need a regular schedule this is not the place to work.
good,Worked with a lot of great people and the work is easy to learn. Most days I cleaned theaters and conducted theater checks. Downside is a lot of people ask for your opinion on movies that you haven't seen.
good,"More strict on cleanliness, but a relaxing atmosphere. You generally have to work every weekend, but they're willing to work with your schedule. The pay is minimum wage, but usually complimentary to the work you're putting in. Easy going environment but busiest on weekends and holidays. Prepare to always work on Christmas day and Thanksgiving."
good,This job usually is for teens getting their first job. It is a very young crowd so it's always exciting to come to work. There are many opportunities for promotions with the company and it isn't a very hard job.
good,You meet a lot of different people throughout the work day. You get to watch all the latest movies that come out as well. The co-workers make the job even more fun as well with all the team work they work together as a team.
good,"Good First Job. Fair amounts of work for the time spent there, pretty laid back. The managers and rest of the staff were all very friendly."
good,Well it was a good company to work for they made it easy to work for they gave me chance to better my life I did pretty well working there and I was promoted
good,"I wouldn't be able to say much about this employer besides saying it was a cool job, got to drive a lot of different cars but the pay sucked!"
good,"They are extremely flexible with your schedule but if you are looking for a job that will give you hours do not work here. It is designed more for students and as a second job. Advancement opportunities are almost non-existent and not worth it, the work performed and responsibilities are not worth the pay. If you do not care about the pay and want the work experience then it is perfect."
good,Regal was a fun place to work with work that kept an employee busy all day long with the perk of watching free movies whenever you felt like it on any given day
good,regal is super cheap and the managers suck a lot of the time but overall everyone is pretty cool and its fun.. except the fact that they fail to fire people who are completely terrible while they threaten to write up people who actually do do their jobs.
good,"Working at a movie theater is all about keeping on the move. At the concessions stand, you have to juggle taking customer orders and special requests, cooking food in the back, refilling the popcorn machine, cleaning up spills - the list goes on. I would say that the hardest aspect was being on your feet for hours on end, so comfortable, non-slip shoes are a must."
good,"great starter job for someone going to school, pay is not competitive and upper management often confused staff by giving different instructions to different lower management representatives, however two free passes a day and 50% off most concessions items isnt too bad ;)"
good,This position was good for a first time worker that is still in school. The hours are crazy but it was a fun environment to work in. It is a job where hard work is always appreciated and recognized.
good,"sometimes it was gloomy attitude at the theater and sometimes it was happy, some workers were rude and some nice. typical day at work was so long and people would never want to cooperate"
good,Working at Regal Entertainment is a good job for people to have as their first job. It's a job meant for people between the ages of 16-18. Pay isn't that great but it's a good learning experience.
good,"Most co-workers were nice, some of them were either difficult to get along with or unpleasant to work with. Management was the same way."
good,while working here i was sexually harrased and emotional abused. i had some bad exsperinces here but without them the only thing i had a major problem with the hours. people were sent home early everyday and know one besides the managers were able to get a full 40 hour work week.
good,"I loved this job but the hours were hard to get, pay was low, benefits non existent unless you were salary. I would do one of three things on any given day, clean theaters, sell concession, or sell tickets. Management was average. They would be present but they would only take care of problems when they got severe. It was hard to get help when night were busy and it was even harder to locate most of them because they were always disappearing when they were needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work in a fast paced environment. Every day was different and it kept you on your toes."
good,"Great place to work. Some days it'll be slow, other days you'll have to be fast paced as it can get hectic. Co workers and mangers are very friendly."
good,Not a place to work if you want a happy work environment. General Management is non existent. I felt very uncomfortable for my year of employment.
good,I would go in open the safe to set up the register with the correct amount of cash to start the business day. Then I would assign the employees their task for the shift. I learned how to be patient and listen to resolve certain situations with both employees and customers which has given me better people skills. I was part of management so that part of the job was ok. The co-workers were some of the best people I had the chance to work with. The hardest part of the job would be when one of the theaters would break down in the middle of the movie especially when its a new release. Having to calm down all those customers at once. The best part of the job was leading my shift workers to a successful night.
good,"I have learned quite a bit while working at Regal and I have enjoyed it.  I either work in the concessions filling orders, or take tickets and check bags, or clean the theaters after the show or do theater checks to make sure the movie is running ok.  "
good,"There was no real ""typical"" day at this job, I was always given a different task, though there were only about 3 options to choose from. My favorite job was concessions because it's the most fast-paced and the most satisfying. The other positions i worked were box office-selling tickets, and checking/cleaning theaters and bathrooms. At the beginning/end of the day everyone cleaned their work stations. I got a lot of customer service experience at this job, which was one of the hardest parts of the job (other than cleaning the popcorn machine) because having a difficult customer can be taxing on an employee's patience, but is also a very satisfying part of the job because helping people is fun. My management was wonderful, I loved all of my managers and each had a different style of management; one manager was very fun to joke with, another was very serious, and yet another was a mix of both, but all of my managers were very goal oriented and fair. Most of my coworkers had good work ethic, but one or two were just goofing around, though that didn't discourage anyone else in the workplace."
good,"A typical day at work would be clocking in, getting the money for your cash drawer at your position you were scheduled in. Obviously, customer service is the biggest part of the job and sometimes that is frustrating because of the prices and the customer's reaction to those prices. Management style includes a heirarchy which starts with a part-time manager, then full-time. Next is the General Manager and then the District Manager. I find that things can be difficult when dealing with issues. For example, having to get the DM's permission to do some of the more simple tasks. "
good,You will have to learn how to resolve situations with the customers. It is good experience in customer service. Very easy job.
good,"There are slow days and very busy days, but I look forward to the busy ones. I enjoy selling throngs of people their favorite foods at the theatre. I learned that you should always work hard and have a positive attitude at all times when working with the public. Management was hardly ever on the same page, which makes it hard to get things done. Some co-workers are cooperative, kind and hardworking while others are lazy, bitter and unhelpful. The hardest part of the job is (very rare) hostile customers, but there is nothing I cannot handle myself. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing my customers happy. I love seeing the smiles on their faces when they come to the theatre and enjoy my customer service."
good,"the pay was horrible but everything else was good , its a hard fast job with not a lot of breaks. its not good pay for how hard you work ,"
good,"Fun place to work, and grow especially if it's your first job in customer service. Managers and staff are very friendly and easy to get along with."
good,"Selling tickets in the box office."
good,GM does not have the best skills in managing his employees. The building is in need of major remodeling so customers can have a better experience.
good,"A typical day of work consist of plenty of polite customers, however there's always a handful of rude customers that i would have to deal with in a polite manner. One of the hardest part of the job is trying to stay calm, collective, and professional even though you have to deal with angry customers screaming at you about how high movie prices are, even though you have no control of the company made prices. "
good,Good stater job fun place to work especially if you like movies. It gives you a lot of skills you can use in the future. Can move up to manager easily.
good,This is a great job for someone who is looking to get a part time job with a fun environment and great opportunity for advancement. Free movies are available to employees with a plus one. Hours and days worked are non consistent and pay is at maximum wage.
good,I'm constantly learning to adapt to new individuals and learning something new everyday is my goal. The hardest part of my job is learning to adapt to new situations each day related with my maintenance responsibilities.
good,"Nothing special here, ok job for college or high school student . Not too much room to move up. Lousy pay for the stress incurred in this job"
good,"I worked at the box office and sold movie tickets.  I liked my managers and co workers.  The job was not hard, but the hardest part was being paid minimum wage.  The most enjoyable was the free movies I got to see."
good,I loved the people and got to see free movies which I loved. I meet many great people at this company.
good,"A typical day was fast pace,I loved  to work there, it was like we were family we all helped each other when needed."
good,"Awesome job, but working nights, holidays and weekends not ideal for a parent trying to raise a kid. Good benefits and decent pay."
good,"- it was a moive theater"
good,"- it was a movie theater"
good,This job started with me as a team member and moving up the ranks as a manager.  I loved working with the employees and helping them learn new things.  I learned that the co-workers I worked with could easily change my perspective on work.  My management above me was only so-so.  They weren't very good at constructive criticism but excelled at destructive criticism.  The hardest part of the job was not being taken seriously by upper management.
good,counting inventory. Stocking the stand. greeting customers and always up selling. Sometimes they will pull staff in order to help the ushers
good,This was my first job and I gained lots of good information about people and how to deal with both good and bad experiences from customers
good,"A typical day includes figuring out which position you will fill in that shift. Then checking in with your shift manager to find what duties you will fulfill within that position. Finally you must carry out the duties expected of that position."
good,"24/7 job expectations, 365 days a year.  Earned valuable experience from several people, especially field operators.  Field management and staff are strong and maintain strong ties with the amount of time on the job.  The hardest part of the job was lack of family time and lack of trust from corporate personnel."
good,I've had this job for over 6 years! It's very easy and there's possible promotion opportunities. Good first job.
good,it was a fun first job and the people were very friendly i learned about customer service
good,"Open snack bar, count all money for register"
good,serve popcorn and other foods. Clean restrooms and popcorn machine.
good,"Poor hours, labor intensive, humiliating work. Low pay for such a lucrative company. You would be absolutely slammed with customers and when the rush was over you'd be let off early."
good,"nice management, but not the greatest."
good,"You would go in deal with customers and I had more reponsibilities than others because I would conduct interviews, count inventory, deposit money, supervise as much as 15-20 employees a shift, worked all holidays and weekends, dealt with securtiy in and out of the building, had to make sure everything was stocked and cleaned for customers throughout the day and night.  Hardest part was getting everything done with very limited time.  Most fun and enjoyable part was getting along with customers as well as employees and making sure spirits were always high and enjoyable work place for everyone to make it go by easier.  As a manager there for six years you learned to make everyone happy at any means necessary but overall as any company, if you are not making them money they will not be satisfied with you."
good,Flexible hours and great for starting off. Looking to advance though.
good,repetative and tedious environmentlacking notions of professionalism
good,"Semi-okay management"
good,"A typical day on the job depends on where they have you stationed.. Either your selling food in concessions, selling tickets out of box, or cleaning up theaters/bathrooms as floor staff. Learned the basics of dealing with costumers. Management varies at locations. Co-workers are usually all around high school age except management. Hardest part of the job was costumer service. Best part of the job was free movies!"
good,Good job for students or young adults working towards their education goals.
good,Nice place to work. Always extremely busy on Sundays but I feel that is what made that place fun to work at because all the other days are extremely slow.
good,"Not a lot of hours to be had. Required to work holidays. Fun job  when you work it, though."
good,I talk to customers. I learned that every person is different but yet the same. management case thing falling and help when is made it.
good,"All employees were cross-trained to better utilize the staff.  Positions trained in were for box office sales, concession sales, and theater usher.  Would be a great place to work for a teenager looking for that first job."
good,"Mostly a weekend job with schedule starting on Friday to Thursday. Learned how to work in an extremely fast-paced environment and acquired customer service skills. Co-workers and management made job the most fun and enjoyable. Blockbuster movies often hit our theater hard, selling out shows for the entire day."
good,A typical day begins with getting the food ready and setting up your work place. Management is fairly good. Hardest part of the job is standing all day.
good,"Good job for a high school student, great people to work for."
good,Fun place to work but often when the line were backed up full of customers and the management would just stand back and keep the line backed up rather than step in and help. Some favortism was demonstrated towards females
good,"I've been a long time theatre employee. Regal has established procedures for ensuring sales, tidiness, and safety."
good,working directly with customers
good,"I need better pay, more hours and a better chance to get promotted"
good,I loved working at the theater but the pay was not competitive and the benefits were not all that great. But the employees were like a little family and i loved that.
good,Greeted customers and provided customer service while meeting a daily quota on register. Cleaned and maintained store appearance.
good,"Lots of rewards, experiences, learning new skills, great environment and atmosphere"
good,Work hours are typically 9:30-6:00. Preparation of concession stands for first shows begins upon arrival. Concession sales last throughout the day. I have learned better customer service skills and concessions equipment operation and maintenance. Management seems to be sincerely interested in employee development. Co-workers are primarily students working part-time. Heavy lifting required for soda boxes. Customer satisfaction is the highlight of this job.
good,"On a daily basis, I am preparing the entire building for opening. I start up all projector units, stock the registers, and perform openIng inventory procedures. When open for business, I either sell tickets, concession items, or both while constantly fielding customer questions and complaints. I deal with all vendors, whether it be a routine inspection or simply ordering stock for the theatre."
good,"It was a solid company, but they weren't willing to negotiate hours with my busy schedule. I felt they were unwilling to work with the employees and didn't negotiate hours a lot."
good,"I like all my managers and team leads, though the presences of the gm and rm wasn't appreciated as their visits often lead to more meaningless tasks. Also, people are terrible at theaters, and the rushes can be quit stressful."
good,"Regal was my first job - and it was a good first job. People were nice, managers were nice. It’s just the corporate higher ups really don’t care about the little man. They don’t pay a live-able wage for the work they make you do. It’s a good job for teenagers who are still in school, but if you have bills to pay, you’re not getting anywhere with Regal. Overall, the work environment is pretty lax, though."
good,Regal is a changing company that is focused in providing a great movie experience. Being a manager at a movie theater has challenges each day. Not only are you in charge of daily operations but also planning for the bigger picture. Being scheduled for opening and late night shifts creates an odd schedule that may seem beneficial for some.
good,I had a bad experience relating to the management. Most of the managers were great except for the GM. He thought he was better than everyone else and treated you like an inferior. He had no respect for newer employees. He was just an overall pain to work with.
good,My coworkers are fantastic. All friendly and willing to help. The managers are very understanding and do their job. I think it’s a good first job but you won’t get much of a raise. I got told working there for 2 years would get me a 1 dollar raise
good,"When working here the only benefit was free movies. But personally if I didn’t work that day you’d never see me near work. I started to hate working there after a few months of constantly being in Concessions. Being in the concession stand would make you go crazy sometimes, with so many people trying to order right before the movie but there would be huge lines forming. Which would make for angry customers, making it more stressful."
good,"Very laid back environment. Super easy job. Show up, do work, make money, make friends, then go home. It's a little hard to stand out here just because the job is so linear, there isn't much else to do besides sell tickets, sell food, or clean theaters."
good,The people were good but the work was tedious. There was a high turnover rate. Things get very busy on the weekends when new movies release. The public are annoying to have to deal with. There isnt a future in working here.
good,"I was very excited to work at Regal Entertainment Group, when I was interviewed by one of the managers I talked with,he seemed very nice, and charismatic, along with the other manager, and was hired right after the interview. The two jobs I worked in was rather simple, working in the concession making and handling food, and working behind the register, and then soon moved to floor, where I cleaned the lobby and the theaters. While there was a lot of moving, and tiring sometimes it was really simple as well, and the workers and I where getting paid the right amount.  However I started figure out that management at the Regal theater I worked at was extremely questionable. Workers continuously complained on how most of the managers lacked any care to the ones working on floor, and how only one was willing to stick up for us when we needed the hours to fill, when they were trying to send us home, and also some shady,suspicious, yet consistent things would be spread about them and what they would do."
good,"its a cinema so it's a good as a first job but I wouldn't want to stay here long term, however it was very easy to move up to manager, I went from cleaning auditoriums to manager within like 3 months."
good,"This is a pretty good place to work as a teenager, however that is all that it should be treated as. The managers were great, the hours were great, the company itself had management policies that reflected poorly (cutting employees hours, secret shoppers) but that isn't a big deal when you are a teenager at your first job. I had a good time, but it is no place to make a career given the minimum wage, obviously."
good,A typical day at work would include assisting and supervising  employees out on the floor. In my opinion the most enjoyable aspect of the job would be getting to work on my feet and interacting with customers and employees.
good,The job does not entail of difficult work but management made it feel impossible. Certain managers would use their authority in a negative form. Some managers would create a messy and unorganized environment.
good,"Regal Entertainment Group was a good employer, especially while attending both high school and college.  They were flexible with my school schedule and mindful of work/life balance."
good,"lower compensation but a fun place to work and learn entry level management skills for younger, less experienced associates. Free movies and, popcorn and soda."
good,"The man reason wouldn't recommend anyone work here is because of the pay. You're expected to do so much more than what you're paid for. Maybe if we weren't paid minimum wage it would be fine, but that's not the case. Also Regal is always open, 365 days a week so there's a huge chance that you'll be working during holidays."
good,pretty easy place to work. very easy to get hired. coworkers are fun and nice customers really suck. management sucks as well. very fast paced. Expect you to learn a lot of different jobs.
good,"There was a lot of standing and you are never allowed to rest or sit down. Cameras are everywhere and employees are monitored at all times. Must always be working and looking for something to pick up, sweep, or clean. If there is nothing to clean inside, you are sent to clean outside and the parking lot."
good,They always under staffed on very busy weekends which made it very hard to to do my job. I did enjoy the benefits of having feee movie tickets at my dispense
good,"Most of the problems are that the building is not well maintained or upgraded. The equipment is so out of date. Other buildings have ovens that can cook a pizza in 3 minutes but at village it takes 7 minutes. Also, corporate is so strict with payroll. Some days almost all the staff gets sent home and the managers take fulfill the staff duties."
good,"Our work pace greatly depended on what movies we received; be prepared to work in both a fast and slow paced working environment. Great work environment, amazing coworkers, dependable management, and an overall spectacular experience. Would trade it for anything."
good,"A great starter job, not too rewarded despite free movies and half off of concessions. Management is debatable, some managers are good and some are bad."
good,"Typical day at work as a Box Office Attendant included being told off by customers because they were unsatisfied by something that was out of my control, back and forth switching between being in box office and helping customers and answering the phone, taking tickets, cleaning bathrooms, and basically everything else they needed you to do. You had to be quick and effective throughout your entire shift and if you close, expect to be there until about 3am. You only get 1-30 minute break for your entire shift, so if you're working a 10 hour shift, you only get a 30 minute break sometime in the middle of that shift. I only worked there as a summer job, but everyone i worked with there was no longer working there when I went to visit. Not a lot of people like this job and not a lot of people stayed for very long."
good,"A typical day at work is either very slow or very packed. It honestly depends on the day and time. It's not just one rush, it's multiple. People come in sets. Our job is to efficiently serve these people and get them into their movies."
good,. I have been working at Regal Entertainment part-time. Pros. Flexible scheduling. Their being open so late means you can work nights if you have school or another job. Free movies and discounts on concessions. Holiday pay.
good,I worked at regal cinemas and really did enjoy my time there. The managers were nice after you got to know them. This is one of those jobs you don't want to do forever. It can be stressful and very fast paced. The hardest part of this job would be the customers and closing. Free movie tickets are fine but not worth it in this case.
good,"The job had only the benefits of free movies, popcorn, soda, and discounts on food. You could ask off for work but it wasn't guaranteed. There was barely room for advancement. You could become a manager but the under a dollar pay raise isn't worth the added work. It's a great starter job but not meant to be a career."
good,"I have met most of my recent friends when I worked as a floor staff member for Regal Entertainment Group.  Most of the workers are young and friendly, but that can sometimes be a friendly.  I worked with a lot of young adults going into college, and some would rather be on their phones than actually doing work.  I thought it was ridiculous that I had to wait a year for a possible 25 cent raise when I did much more at work than workers who had been there for years."
good,"Long shifts for a high school student. Minimal break time. Definitely not too bad comparatively, but would end every day exhausted. Made popcorn, swept hallways and theaters, restocked food, and dealt with customer complaints."
good,"Not the greatest job but it’s a good job for experience and to start off your job career. They management is fairly nice and so are the coworkers. It’s slowpaced at times and fast paced on usually weekends, new movie/big movie releases, ang holidays."
good,"It is a fun place to work, the benefits are nice, The General Manager is not my favorite person there. But the employees are really nice and fun to work with. And the management are nice and helpful."
good,Great first job minimum wage pay a lot of teenagers working there. Can't expect much however you would get free movie passes. Clean theaters and work a register pretty easy stuff.
good,I have been a manager for 2 years now and I love my job. I have learned how to deal with guest issues and how to always give the best possible guest experience. I love the people I work with and that I get to hire and train new people all the time. I love that every day is a learning experience and it never gets old. The hardest part of my job has to be the poor management above me. There is always inconsistency and policy changes come frequently. Management also never looks into our concerns.
good,"Pros:"
good,"working at regal was very inconsistent working 4 hours a day and you would barely get that. The customers you don't know what you getting into sometimes , but you make the best of it ."
good,"Only in very rare circumstances does the chance arise to advance. Otherwise, this is strictly an entry level job, with potential raises coming about only one every year."
good,Overall an easy job with a relaxed work environment.  However advancement is difficult and there are very few hours.  The benefits packages available are also lack luster.
good,it has good coworkers however the managers were not very accommodating when i had medical issues. i was unable to get to work due to medical issues that have been on and off for the past two almost three years.
good,"as an employee here for 8 years started as bookkeeper is very stressful especially for the approval and releasing of budget.. But with that system i adopted it, and very patient for the sake of the job and earnings. But sometimes money is not all that matters if you are not happy anymore with that place. "
good,This company allows its employees the ability to move up relatively easy. If you want to move up in the company and you love movies than I highly suggest this company especially if you are young!!! If you go to school/college this company definitely works with your schedule. Great place to work
good,"I worked at a Regal in Lincolnshire, Illinois that was my all time favorite work environment and still go back time to time to visit good people there. "
good,"Cool college or high school job, not many perks besides free movies and pop and that's about it. The managers aren't very helpful even after I've told them continuously that a co worker is innapropiatly touching my hips and rear"
good,"A typical day at work was doing my assessment with clients.I learn that is very important to be patient advocate.I managed and coordinated patient care.I had good relationship with co-workers.The hardest part of my job was low season,not enough clients in the agency.The most enjoyable part of my job was went patient was healed"
good,It's a nice job. The culture is great. Lots of different things to learn and do. You deal with customers of all sorts. Great all around experience. Management is pretty fair. Usually work weekends and mostly you'll work closing which ends around 12. They have one person stay until 1am as well. Part time is still lots of work. And you gotta be able to bust through it all. Good starter job
good,"This location was just being built when when I applied and hired, there was a lot of training for people who were just starting out so it made for a good first job. It was just more stressful then it probably should have been since they opened the start of the Christmas season so we were busy right away so we had to hit the ground running. I worked in every part of the theater and became proficient at all of them which made switching tasks whenever needed easily. "
good,"It's a great first job to have, your coworkers will be amazing. Sometimes your managers will be cool to. At times the job can be demanding and stressfull. People call out and you can be understaffed and still expected to do all your duties and more. Free movies but u still had to pay for snacks. The company tries to make employees happy but, you will really be underpaid for all the work you do. Cleaning up bathrooms and huge theatres, dealing with rude and unreasonable customers."
good,"Fast pace environment, but very fun! Had a good time learning responsibility and self management. Very easy job for younger people."
good,"Working at Regal Cinemas has been a pleasure but it does get old doing the same thing every day."
good,Fun place to work. The compensation is not worth the stress or headache but still a fun place to work. Everyone is friendly.
good,Fairly incompetent corporate office. Front line stores are employed by great people who have access to little support.
good,Working as either a regular employee or as a Manager Regal entertainment group is fast pace company. You deal with hundreds of customers on a daily basis that you gain excellent customer service skills the longer you work there. You also gain great salesmanship dealing with customers at the box office or concession stand.
good,This a company you can really advance in if you apply yourself. there's a lot of great thing you can learn while working in an environment like this.
good,Was an employee for 10 years. Promoted to management. Great place to make friends and to work for as a teenager. That is all
good,A typical day at work would consist of seeing if you would be working concessions or ushering. I learned that with a majorly youthful workforce you need a little bit more veteran or older leadership. Co-workers were great but with such a young work force at the time immaturity was a huge issue amongst many of the staff. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the bathrooms. The most enjoyable was being able to watch free movies upon requesting to do so with the managers or supervisors.
good,"Great place to work, very fun and free movies are always good. The money isn't very good but the atmosphere is great and would be a great place for a younger person to work."
good,"A typical day at Regal Entertainment is usually a very busy one; Especially, if a big movie is due to release. As co workers, we work hard as a team to ensure that everyone gets into their movies safely and efficiently. Concession staff sells the food and the usher team cleans up after the shows end. Management does a great job making sure we stay on track and work together throughout our shifts. The hardest part, I would say is ""Primetime"", at around 7 pm or so. We get our biggest rush of the day. It's hard to keep up with the 5 or 6 hundred people coming in within that hour. Nonetheless, the job gets done each and every night due to outstanding teamwork. I enjoy most when the rush settles down, and everybody is satisfied with their movie."
good,"During my short time there, I learned quite a bit about the movie theater industry. Working here was definitely busy, with long lines of movie goers in between movies letting out and starting at concessions. One of my favorite parts about working here was the ""ushering"". Basically it was cleaning the movie theaters in between movie screenings and making sure the lobby and hallway were kept clean as well. But it was the most easy going part of this job and still kept you jumping because it was also busy."
good,"My experiences have varied widely under differing management styles. However, this fun, fast-paced environment always benefits from a management team that works well together. "
good,"A typical day at the movie theater would include; selling tickets, taking tickets, directing customer to the correct theater, serving food / drinks, cleaning behind concessions and auditoriums and other customer service. I learned great customer service skills, how to deal with unhappy customers and happy ones. I learned how to handle money, and how to work well in a team. Most of my co-workers were nice and easy to get along with, I never had any trouble with anyone I worked with and if I did I wouldn't ever make it obvious. I can get along with about anyone. The hardest part of the job was staying up until 2 sometimes 4 AM closing and cleaning up. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to be around other co-workers and customers, I would consider myself to be a people person so I enjoy working around people. Also even though working late wasn't the best, closing and cleaning at the end of the day with all my co-workers was pretty enjoyable"
good,"great cast young members and assisting management,"
good,My coworkers and managers are great to work with and it makes it enjoyable to go to work
good,New and exciting challenges happen every day. Weekly events keep things fresh. Making patrons happy is best part of job.
good,A typical day varies based on the department you work that particular day. However it always involves cleaning and tending to customers. I learned food safety and how to do things in a speedy manner. Management was not always constant and do not always hire management from within. Is very hard to get promoted to manager. Hardest part was the clean up at the end of the night. Most enjoyable was free movies.
good,"Routine work, busy majority of the time with mostly unpleasant customers. I learned people skill as in how to reason with the customer making sure they can have a pleasant visit. My co workers were very young and inexperienced. The most enjoyable part were the benefits."
good,"I work as a team here at Regal. I never work alone, unless they schedule me to work a shift alone (usually in concessions), but even the managers come out to make sure everything's okay and if I need something. I definitely advanced in my people skills here, though. I can talk freely with another person and feel comfortable, unlike when I first came to regal. I was a quiet person and kept to myself most of the time. I definitely learned more in money. Of course, Regal's prices go in quarters, so its fairly easy to learn, but we did get the occasional penny, nickel, and dime. I learned that a fast-paced environment is when you can't sit around and joke a lot. You need to make sure not to get behind or the customers won't be happy. Always be top of your game. Management knows best. Yes, we did have our days where I didn't agree with what one of my supervisors did or said. But, it's best not to argue with them unless they're being absolutely absurd. There are a few of my managers who I know truly care about me and I can get along well with, but then there are one or two who I feel like don't want to get their emotions into their work. I can't talk to them about anything unless it's work. The hardest part of the job is probably closing for concessions. You have to make sure every machine is being closed down. The oven and the popper are the big ones. It's just a step-by-step process and it's easy to forget one or two. But, our managers come out and inspect us as we're closing down. Plus, you get out at around midnight or later. I prefer my nights. My favorite part of the job is"
good,"The Regal movie theaters that i am located is a really good place for young adults to advance their work experience. Dealing with thousands of people with different personality, teaches you how to cooperate with them with customer service. Co-workers and Management to me treat you like family have fun inside and out of work."
good,Regal Entertainment offers sufficient customer service and satisfactory performance. It is a very interesting atmosphere to work in both with the employees and costumers. Employees are diverse in their background and personalities.
good,"Regal expects a certain level of payroll, and if a theater doesn't hit the numbers - the GM will be written up and then often they take it out on the managers and the trickle down continues. It wasn't always this way, but the company has become all about the numbers making it hard to enjoy the fun that is the great industry."
good,"A typical day is preparing all the essentials for the rush that will come throughout the day, serve popcorn and drinks, and all food, I learned to move in a fast pace, Management is good, not the best. Sometimes ask too much for a minimum paid job.  Co-workers are great, love them all; very friendly! Hardest part of the job is probably, having to close which is staying til 3 am in the mornings. The most enjoyable about this job, is having co-workers that can relate to me."
good,"Through the many highs and lows of this job, I genuinely appreciated Regal as my first job. I learned many things about cash handling, inventory, and customer service that I will be sure to take with me in my future endeavors, but the demands and favoritism of management was sometimes unbearable. All and all, I enjoyed being able to say regal was my first job."
good,"Its a cool place to work for movie lovers, don't confuse it with a career, Great benefits for full-time employees, advancement opportunties are alot except that you would have to leave NY!!!"
good,The people you get to meet from working at a high profile location
good,"A typical day at work was sweeping up popcorn, organizing and stocking inventory, taking orders for customers."
good,They are very welcoming and always try to work with your schedule to benefit you and the work area. Great people and a very entertaining place. You can also enjoy free movies .
good,"If you like movies, then this is for you since you get i think 2 free tickets per week and half off of concession, alcohol is regular priced, which is pretty normal i think. They like to train people at every position (ticket sales, tearing tickets, concessions, theater checker, and theater cleaner, kitchen) some of these positions are super chill, like checker, but that can get boring for extended periods. concessions and kitchen on the weekends can be pretty busy, which makes those spots less fun but your shift flies by when its busy."
good,Very good starting job but with so many new policy's and changes the job became way to stressful and all the old employees and managers started to quit which made the work load become heavy on those who were still there. Guests got a lot more angry with the continuous changes and took it out on the employees.
good,"The experience working at Regal is a very mixed bag. I have loved my time in my position soley because l work with wonderful people and the managers at my location are great. We all care about each other, work well together, and truly feel like a family. But the way the company itself is run is unfortunate. The pay is simply not enough (not for management or team leads either) and it truly feels like corporate does not care an ounce about the people actually running these buildings for them. No benefits for floor staff, and now we barely even get free tickets. Corporate is constantly changing the way we do miscellaneous processes and it makes it difficult to develop speed and/or answer customer questions. If you just need a little extra money, my location is nice, but Regal itself truly doesn't care about its employees. We no longer receive yearly raises, even though our prices continue to rise. Just an overall terrible business, l cannot stress that enough."
good,"It's not a bad job, but it's definitely not something you'd wanna stay at. Doesn't pay enough and doesn't work you enough. However the environment is inviting and the staff for the most part are understanding"
good,"i loved working there. Management was great, however, they hired little kids. Meaning they didn't know how to do their job, they played around, and there was too much drama,"
good,"I look back at my time during Regal with a mix of happiness and nostalgia, and a mix of stress and typical low-end job qualities. However, the staff and fellow employees made up for a lot of the shortcomings with their positive and friendly community that, if you opened yourself up to them, would allow you to make healthy friendships."
good,"Bight energetic company that loves to keep people wanting more. Great start up job for students, and easy to advance. Benefits come with high standards."
good,I do belive that regal is a nice place to work but not to stay for a long time. At times management can be unprofessional and some co workers make it very hard to work there.
good,A typical work day is slow but weekends are very stressful. The general manager is not the best but not bad either. Lower managers are great though. It's an okay workplace. Hardest part of the job is finding the motivation to work because you work 8 hour shifts and only get paid $8.40.
good,"A typical day at work is making sure the checklist in the area that you're assigned is completed by the end of your day. As a manager, the goal is to designate tasks to the employees under your charge. What I learned is that caring too much for the job can be held against you, but not caring enough can also have the same effect. So, there's a lot of give/take, but far too often, there's no reward for giving more than taking. The hardest part of the job is that you'll never finish what you've started. The most enjoyable part of the job are the fellow colleagues you meet and the relationships you build with said colleagues."
good,"While the work is easy and the perks for the part time position are nice, at my current location, there is quite a bit of micromanagement coming from the general manager and there has previously been little to no incentive for working more due to raises being small or non-existent. Although there are a few issues like this, I would still recommend the floor staff position as a good starting job."
good,"IT'S  fun place to work but varies greatly by location you learn crowd management and cash management, customer service skills communication skills, time management.Hard part holidays and storms"
good,"It is a fun place to work at, however management needs to communicate between themselves. But overall fun job to meet new people and and to build up more skills."
good,"It is a great place to work, for a first job, because it is has a great balance between slow and fast paced. The employees and management was a reason to stay due to their friendly nature this causes the environment to comforting. The only downfall is that the pay is really bad for the amount of work that is done."
good,"a typical day at Regal Movie Entertainment was a very fun, and interesting place. The amount of different cultures you see throughout the day and interacting with others i learned a lot. Sometimes i had good days sometimes i had bad days but overall interacting with the guest was the best part of the job"
good,"It's a pretty good place to work. Some of the managers just can't handle the stress very well. They are really good people, but when the stress hits they get very frustrated."
good,"Good first job. "
good,I happily serviced customers in a unique way that kept customers entertained. The management preferred operating in a manner that would have been generic.
good,Fast paced work environment when it would get busy. Learned how to work at a fast pace and basic movie industry knowledge. The hardest part of the job had to be the quick pace. The best part of the job was the free movie discount.
good,I enjoy working at Regal Cinemas Theaters. My coworkers are fun to work with. The managers are great. People who don't have any work experience should definitely apply here.
good,"Regal is a great place for a first job.  Management at my location is incredibly friendly, so are most of the employees.  Training is easy to pick up on and you'll be assisted with anything if you get a bit confused."
good,Regal can do better. Pay management what they deserve. They ask so much but give so little. Management asked for crazy requests that seem unreasonable and simply time wasteful. If employees were given more incentives then they would probably love coming to work
good,"I have worked there for nearly three years and can say that the pay is abismal, work can be stressful and tedious, management is polarized, but the fellow employees have kept me happy."
good,"the job itself is okay, just doesn't pay enough for it to be a main job. another issue is say if you aren't able to make it into work, you are required to find someone to cover your shift or bring in a doctors note. if not you get written up and beings though we don't have that many employees at my location, it is not easy to find someone to work for you and they also have to be trained in the position you work that day. most days I work box office and not many employees are trained in box office"
good,"This is a job for a high schooler. Not good pay, but free movies. No advancement, barely and raises, and full of drama. Fun while it lasts, but you'll move on to higher paying jobs."
good,"•	Greeted customers at the door/directed them to their theater"
good,"I worked when they still did 3 am showings, so you wouldn't get home until around 6 a.m. That's changed now, so no 4 a.m. cleaning the concessions stand. "
good,Fun place to be moving on your feet. It gets very busy but great team of employees to work along side with. Free movies and great pay for food runners. $10 an hour to run food is great for me!
good,I worked as a concessionist. There are times where there is absolutely nothing to do and then all of a sudden you have a hundred customers in line. It is fast-paced. Prepared to get burned on your arm at times by the popcorn maker. It left a scar that eventually faded after a while.
good,"The people who I worked with was pretty much the only reason I stayed as long as I did, coworkers and managers alike were all very nice and likable.  However Regal clearly does not care about their employees as they force weird and sometimes absurd tasks on the regular cast members such as reading a list off before actually taking your customers order, or having to point to your name tag and say your name everytime you greet a customer.  Not to mention the low pay for both the managers and the regular employees for the much larger amount of work that they both do.  Overall I'd say my time there was decent but only because of the people who I was working with."
good,Interacting with customers on a daily basis. Upper management is constantly working against you and forget acknowledgement for ideas and good work ethic. But day to day mangers are outgoing and fun. Many rude customers but you learn to pick your battles. hardest part was probably doing con. when we get new movies. But its so worth it when you get your two free movie tickets a day:)
good,"what really kept me there for so long was that the daily jobs/duties in all the positions (concession stand, box office, usher, ticket greeter) were all fairly easy. the managers are really nice and my co-workers made each work day enjoyable"
good,"The plant I worked at was purchased by Regal 8 months ago and they left the current management in place, so it's hard to say what kind of company Regal is. I can say that at the plant I worked there was a good home/life balance. My co-workers and I got along good (I'm still friends with people there). The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to solve issues on the floor and coming up with fixes that made a direct impact for the company. Our local managers were courteous and willing to work with you to get things done."
good,Regal was a great first job for me. It helped teach me self independence and how to manage my earnings. This job is a bit underpaid for what you had to do. 7.25 is gas money and Regal just wasn't cutting it for what I needed for college.
good,"This job has taught me a lot in regards to customer service, money handling, inventory. Regal is a very fun and energetic place to work."
good,"I honestly really enjoy working at the theater; a large part of that, though, is that my particular location has an excellent crew. Every single employee, managers included, is professional to the customers but casual and friendly with each other. It's so much easier to work hard knowing that it's for the sake of a valued co-worker and friend, as opposed to simply a boss who will never appreciate you, as has been my experience at other places of work."
good,"Typical work day either can include, verifying safe, setting up tills, make sure all product is ready to go and all employees are ready, selling products, assisting other employees, greeting guests, dealing with guest concerns in a positive way, verifying all movies are playable and ready to go, closing tills, verifying safe at the end of day, counting all inventory every evening."
good,If you're in high school and need some extra cash this is an ideal job to work for or if you just need some money to make over the summer.However once school starts don't expect the same amount of hours you once had.
good,its a good first job for a kid in high school. you get to watch as many movies as you want and they make you work all the positions so you learn and gain experience for future jobs.
good,"Overall, I have enjoyed my time working for Regal Entertainment Group but I would like to work somewhere where independent thought and ideas are taken into account.  The job is very rigid and does not allow for any individuality.   My immediate supervisors are receptive but they are also hamstrung by the culture of corporate rigidity that has become the norm over the past few years.  That being said I have learned a great deal regarding guest service and retail operations over the years. I have become proficient in the daily operations of the business in such areas as cash handling, inventory management, scheduling, P&L management, team building and human resources to name a few."
good,This job for me was a great insight to what people actually do so you have the best possible experience. With this knowledge and having a good management system as well as a good team I am glad to say that this job is ideal for a student or someone who is only seeking part time work. Just do not complain the works hard you are there to make the customers come back for the best experience and as a customer we thank you for all the efforts you put in.
good,I didn't really care for this job at all. There was very unprofessional things going on there.
good,"A typical day at work always involves cleaning. Their motto; ""ABC - Always Be Cleaning."" We have to clean windows, glass, sweep every bit of debris off the floor, off counters or outside. We have to clean in the theaters between movies, and in the hallways or bathrooms."
good,"I would clock in, go upstairs to put my things in my locker with a security camera in there, say hello to people and start working. My coworkers were always very welcoming as were some managers. I learned how to use the complicated cash register that i thought i would never be able to use. I also learned what good customer service is and how to market up your values. The hardest part of the job was doing everything perfect. Even though i thought i would do a perfect job working the cash register, the manager would point out my flaws. The most enjoyable was double tasking. Double tasking always made me feel like i had 10 years of experience of working at Regal."
good,"A day at Regal movie theater was working register, ticket taking, giving out tickets, cleaning, handling money, training new employes, and closing the store. I learned what it takes to run a company or at least what it takes, learned how to communicate with my co-workers, learned how to handle money, and clean up after a long days work."
good,"You start earning good money and you get to watch free movies. However, when you are looking for advancements, there are really scarce opportunities since there is no opportunity at all."
good,"could have been a better place of work, if new managment was involved."
good,"Easy and slow"
good,It is a good job for a first job and people who are looking to advance quickly that’s one thing this company has going for it is internal opportunities which is nice but I feel the compensation is not worth it considering fast food places are now getting like a dollar above minimum and this being a minimum wage job. However great environment nice co workers and a generally happy environment to work in.
good,"The theater I work at is filled with great people. However, corporate office and higher end managers don’t seem to care about employees. Two of the hardest working managers I work with are quitting because they feel mistreated by our current district manager. Regal does provide a great system of promoting from within. Regal is a great place for cast members but not for full time managers as there is nofufillment of doing a good job"
good,"I mean, if this is your first job, then this would be great. However, because I just graduated from college, I want to move on. What I will say is that, if you're going to college, they will work with your schedule. They will give you time off. They are good about that."
good,Regal has recently been bought by a British company (Cine-world). They have a new mission to cap salaries and cut management in order to save money in the long term.  This has created mass amounts of managers and employees quitting their long term jobs.  It is nearly impossible to get any time off now that the new restructure has happened.
good,"Great starter job with fun people and environment, but not enough hours or pay and can be redundant. If you can deal with some picky and dirty people, then you will be fine. That is only a small part of the job."
good,"The management is good but some managers are not "
good,"I enjoyed working at Regal, however, management wasn’t “outstanding.” A majority of our managers were amazing, but some of them weren’t the greatest people. I enjoyed my coworkers, my customers, and the great benefits i got there. The pay was fair, the amount of hours i got were also fair."
good,"The work is good, but expect to get burned as a concessionist. Prepare to clean and talk a lot. Managers are pretty easy going, but don't never mix business with pleasure."
good,"Regal Cinemas was a good job, but it didn't pay well enough. Getting paid minimum wage to work 30 hours a week wasn't fun, because it was a tough job. I dealt with bad customers, and sometimes I feel that I didn't get treated fairly."
good,It was a very fun environment and the serivce was really well. They made sure we were safe and had fun while working. The employee discount and free movies pro was an plus.
good,"This was my first job and I gained great skills to help me with future careers like how to maintain a clean work space, work in a fast paced environment, and problem solve."
good,"While the pay is low, you get free movies and usually find that the employees AND managers have the same interests as you do.  It is a good job for beginners at customer service."
good,"For most, a typical day at work would be a few short hours (normally 3-4) with a huge hustle of people that were normally rude and complained about prices. I learned many cleaning practices and how to keep people happy with great customer service and safe and clean facilities and food. Management, for the most part, was friendly and understanding, but General Management was a hassle to get a hold of and communicate with properly on a daily basis."
good,"Fun to work at, busy in weekends and holidays, works good with schedule, easy to request off for vacation. Working weekends and holidays is mandatory. Late nights. Great pay. Overall pretty enjoyable."
good,Fun and loving place but lacks leadership for everyone is usually doing what they want. Managers are fun to work with and crew slacks off at times but it's a great place to work at for a first job
good,"I hadn't worked there for very long, but I enjoyed selling products and convincing people to buy more than they want. That was part of my job. I also prepped drinks, made the popcorn, swept the floor and cleaned up when it was slow. My benefits were watching any movie with, I believe it was 1 or 2 people for free. Which was pretty nice."
good,"I love the managers at my theater. They will not get angry with you, they will just tell you what to do better the next time. The coworkers are also very nice. The customers are mostly nice, but there are always exceptions. The thing people don't realize about regal is that they are a product based business, therefore they only schedule for the bare minimum. My schedule is very terrible because I only get scheduled once a week, which really sucks when trying to make some money."
good,"great for a first job always moving and learning new things and new ways to do thing "
good,"Honestly, if you like movies, it's a great job. I've worked at two different theaters and the management has made the biggest difference. Most of the job duties include working the concession stand, cleaning theaters and bathrooms, selling tickets, or standing at the door. Management at my old San Jacinto theater was outstanding and I became friends with them, the Ontario theater however, while being pretty easy-going has one or two managers that take the job a little too seriously. Co-workers (With an exception or two) have been amazing and I've made some very good friends with some of them. Most of them are also very competent at their jobs. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with unruly customers at times or just having to sit and work the door. The best part of the job is getting to see parts of movies for free, then you can know if you want to actually see it or not."
good,I learned how to better serve my customers needs and wants. I learned in to answer questions in very professional manner over the phone.
good,"Working here for 4 years+ has given me a lot of perspective of what customer service is and team work is as well as responsibility. Although work isn't very consistent, one can learn to appreciate that in the fact that they begin to watch themselves develop so much work ethic that will certainly stick with them throughout their career to pass onto their colleagues."
good,For starting out as your first job or second its great. But coming with experience and starting out it sucks. Its only part time and you never know whats going to happen.
good,"I loved working for the movie theater for the time I was working and have no regrets. The pay is very low, and advancement is rare. The managers are incredible, and the work is easy. However the managers sometimes expect more out of their employees than they are willing to compensate them for. I learned hard work because the General Manager runs a tight crew. The hardest part of the job was when the managers expect so much out of the group that morale drops slightly."
good,A typical day was serving cutomers food and beverages. Management and coworkers were always fun to work with as long as the job was getting accomplished.
good,"Go in, check stock, make sure everyone is on the same page...work 2 or 3 rushes..deal with customers unhappy about the pricing. All employees and managers are upbeat and happy for the most part. Over all a decent place to work. My advice would be to request working mornings only."
good,This is one of the most fun places I have worked. There is a great staff and there is always something exciting about to happen. The downside is the hours are not enough to make a living on.
good,"If you see yourself has someone who likes working with a team to accomplish task the Regal is the spot. A day at work consist of standing 5-9 hours behind snack bar, ushing, or door post."
good,"A typical workday would include either working as an usher or in the concessions. In concessions, one is expected to provide excellent customer service. as an usher one is responsible for maintaining the cleanliness of the theater."
good,You get to meet different kinds of people and get the opportunity to learn about other people's culture either from a coworker or customers. It can be difficult dealing with some customers but you learn how to deal with it after a while.
good,Regal Entertainment was enjoyable to work at. The best part was they employees and fellow colleagues i was able to work with. Team-work is a must as well as being able to work independently and mulit-task under pressure during peak business periods.
good,"management at the location is great but the higher ups don't care about you, how hard anyone works, are if you are doing you job.  they just want the money and will walk all over you to make it."
good,"This place is fun to work at, and you can get promoted easily from within."
good,"Typical day varied by the level of business, it is very fast when busy but can become bored when business is slow especially when you like to stay busy. Learned how to maintain composure in all situations. Management was great.  It was a friendly environment. Hardest part of the job was sometimes interacting with difficult people. Meeting pleasant new people every day, building professional relationships and great relationship with co-workers."
good,Worked for Regal over the summer. It was my first job. Good introduction to the workforce. Slow paced environment for the most part. Good management and team members.
good,"Seems almost everyone I know worked for a movie theater at one point. It's a great job for while you're in High School, or going to college. Flexible hours for the most part. Managers have a bit more flexibility, but once you've become a manager there's very little room for growth/advancement."
good,"Loved working here. This was one of my first jobs and I'd recommend this to anyone starting off in the work field. You get to watch free movies with one other guest which is pretty great, you get discounts on certain concession items. Management was pretty cool. They stay open 365 days a year. It's kind of like house keeping during the weekends or busy nights while you're ushering, it's just so much trash and people to clean up after."
good,sometimes I worked as much as my general mananger. I did not receive my pay raises at all.. I barely made more than floor staff. The newer manager made more than me. There were man days I would work double shifts and by myself as a manager. Floor staff worked good and brings a fast pace environment.. Hardest part of the job was trying to get others to come in on their day off. We did receive free movies and drinks and popcorn
good,"A collaborative and friendly work environment, in which we learn from one another. A typical day at work consist of making sure customers are being satisfied and expectations are being met. As a manager we make sure that all of our customers get the REGAL treatment. The most enjoyable part of my job is the fact that everyday is a new learning experience."
good,"I loved my managers and my co-workers. Working at a theater was a relatively easy going job. Especially the smaller theaters that I ended up working at. Only problem is if you're needing to pay bills, then this isn't the type of job for you."
good,Free to run your own building. Schedules can be grueling at times. Not ideal time off. Customers can be the most difficult part of the job. Benefits can be great.
good,"Regal is a fun place to work, I worked in both the Brunswick and Augusta locations and enjoyed both equally, the co-workers are usually high school kids but are generally great kids and i'm still friend with a lot of them to this day. The Management is abrasive at first but once you get to know them they are pretty awesome, the problem being is it is a VERY corporate company so they don't have a lot of say on how the theater SHOULD be run as much as how corporate WANTS it run whether it be movies being played that don't do well up in norther New England to redesigning the interior of the theater to give it a ""Alamo Drafthouse feel"" which granted is better than Neon ""early 90's feel"" but still doesn't fit. "
good,a typical day includes coming in on time and selling tickets to people and answering the phone when it rings you may have to deal with a few difficult customers but you can always call an manger if you cant solve their problems
good,"Being floor staff I either worked box office selling tickets or in concessions selling food and accommodate our customers while watching there movie. I learned how to operate a cash register, and to operate our equipment to cook our hot food, and how to manage our stock because everything we had was inventory. I always had fun working with my co workers that what I enjoyed the most. The hardest part was being in rush on weekends serving hundreds of customers at a time trying to make sure everyone is happy."
good,"Fast Paced job environment with amicable staff. Each day the cleanliness standards were thoroughly met. The most enjoyable part of the job was being surrounded by fellow staff during the day. Each day there was a different area I was in charge of, providing excellent cross training. The Hardest part of the job were customers, but the process of helping was also enjoyable. I, as well as others, felt that management could've handled scheduling and inter staff problems better. Management of the entire facility was great overall however."
good,"A typical day at Regal Entertainment Group entailed opening or closing the theater for business. This included distribution of cash, preparing projection booth and concession stand, and ensuring guests have an enjoyable experience. Work came in ""rushes"" that lasted an hour or so when all movies began and ended. "
good,"I started working in Regal Cinemas while i was attending highschool. Regal was a very fun place to work at. My duties was not stable it was more self managment. i started off as a cashier serving popcorn and drinks to the custimers also cooking diffrent typs of foods needed for the time being. Later i was moved to custodien, picking up trash after each movie was over and prepare them for the next show. also to change the trashcans out throught the movie theator. sometimes restalking drinks and other items. Later i was moved to the desk to recieve tickets from custimers and then tell them witch room their movie was located."
good,"Working for regal cinemas had it's ups and downs. I loved my co workers and GM which made days easier. The hours were rough, most nights working until 2am and working every holiday including Christmas. Overall it was a great learning experience since everyday was working directly with customers."
good,"Working at Regal was a pretty exciting experience. At times, it was a lot of hard work. But it was worth it purely for the staff."
good,Regal has too many managers and team leads. The Team leads act like they’re better than their co workers and weren’t helpful. They all have different instructions which made it super confusing for new people to follow along. It was very hard to move up ranks and very hard to be happy while working. This job is a job you do for money. You’re not suppose to stay at this job for long.
good,It was a typical first job for a 16/17 year old. I worked at the register as well as in the concessions stand. The management was very clear in what they needed from us without being overtly pushy. The worst part was the heat of the concessions stand as well as the hazardous slippery floors by the poppers. I think the best part was my coworkers and being able to bond over the job.
good,"It is what you would expect from a movie theater job. Working concession, working the box office, working as an usher. It is what you would expect and not much more. However that does not make it bad."
good,The management needs work. You shouldn't hire so many people just to let them go in a short time. I was told that I would get to keep my job if I worked hard. I did exactly that and still got let go.
good,"It was a fun place to work at as a floor staff member but as management it can suck. It can become extremely high paced, you have lots of responsibilities to take care on top of making sure everything downstairs is running smoothly at all times. A lot of the GMs are sexist. Things are always changing, as the company like to attempt stay on top of new trends. Management will try to talk you into things that are really only in their best interest. My boss and his boss tried to talk me out of going back to college and I put my two weeks in that day."
good,"Most theaters open around noon, so the working day starts close to 11am. Depending on the day and what movies are out you may work as late as 5 or 6am. Most weekends end the day around 2am, it's only when there is a big release like Star Wars that you would stay so late. Shortest shift is 4.5 hours, longest is around 8 unless you take over someone else's shift. My theater separated employees by roles with little opportunity to cross-train. They would cross-train you only if you bugged them enough or if they were considering you for a senior cast member role, and often would not schedule you cross-training shifts, you were expected to learn while also doing your current job. Management often put rules in place without thoroughly conveying their expectations. Most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers."
good,A nice place to work and a place where you can make new friends and add on as a working family. I will miss working for them as it was nice meeting everyone and learning new skills to develop my work character.
good,"I loved working here, everyone I worked with was very kind including the managers. There are definitely places to grow. Starting from floor staff you can move into a management position in a little over a year if you really give it your all (must be 18 or older). This is an amazing place to start working, but I wouldn't consider it long term due to the minimum wage. They offer annual raises based off performance, the max being 3%"
good,"I enjoyed my time there and while it was very stressful at times, I enjoyed working there and gaining the proper experience needed to further my working career."
good,"I loved working for Regal. Management was great to work for and was fair. Co-workers were great and always helped out in a team effort. Worked my way up to management myself and enjoyed being a manager even more, plus pay was good. However, I was terminated because of one customer service complaint that was made about me. I got into an argument with her after she wanted to report me for something I had no control over. HR doesn't care about your hard work, dedication, or sacrifices, just covering their butts so if anything went to a corporate, no one was safe. I've seen many great workers get fired over this."
good,"A typical day at works starts with me walking through the door and making sure that all food and products are stocked and fellow employees have chipped away at the cleaning list. Towards the end of the day I pre-close and make sure that all chores and duties are completed within the given time."
good,Assigned to a certain job or department. Learned how to adapt to certain jobs. Management was not all to great. Co-workers always worked as a team majority of the time.
good,Pretty cool job for students.flexible with your schedule.
good,A typical day at work is pretty easy and chill we usually get busy around a big movie release date the  management staff are badly helpful and kind overall this is a good first job for anyone
good,this was my first job when i was 16 years old and i absolutely loved it! it was a great learning experience and the people are great there. the discounts were really good too!
good,"I tend to have the same schedule for each week due to half of our staff being High School students. I have learned how to handle a register, cook food in a set time, and how to clean effectively and quickly."
good,"working in high school, they worked around my school schedule. Advanced pretty quick. Management were all pretty nice. Overall not a bad place to work at. Plus the free movies are a great bonus."
good,"On a standard day, I'll stand by the entrance where patrons get their tickets ripped upon entry. If necessary, I'll enforce the rules for the dress code, (no hoodies) often I'd also check for bags. The managers are very pleasant to be around. My co-workers are slightly younger then me, but we still get along fine. My weakness would be standing in one place for hours, but i cope very well with that objective. I enjoy doing theater checks, prevents me from being stagnant in one place."
good,"The people are great, you get free movies, it's just not a super FUN job. It closes really late, but you don't have to be available then if you don't want. Sometimes there's crazy rushes."
good,"Regal, albeit a hard working job for what was, at the time, minimal money, was a fun experience and I learned plenty. The job was hard working and reasonable, ultimately the workload is what slowed me down and made me a much better worker. Recommended if you're into doing a hefty amount of manual labor."
good,Working At Regal Was Good ...I Love Making Popcorn And Taking Orders .. I Did Have Some Bad Days But I Got It Together And Continued Working Like It Was One Of The Best Days Of My Life
good,"6 hour Shifts, Free popcorn, Free movie tickets. Best job for a 16 year old."
good,Working at Regal was a fun experience and made me learn more about customer service. The staff of people made the job ten time more enjoyable. The managers were really professional and friendly to everyone.
good,I don't mind working here. I do love my job. The pay is the only thing I don't like besides the hours. We are only aloud 27 hours a week.
good,"Just was working the food, Learn how to start movies & how to set it up. Mangers were ok. Hardest part was making sure every customer got what he/she wanted. I enjoyed working with friends."
good,Good for people in school. Doesn't really consist of hardwork but only pays minimum wage and weekends are always required while you're usually kept longer than your set shift.
good,"Easiest job I have had. Most managers were very cool and easy going. Sometimes awful when I had an 8 hour shift up at the box office alone, but overall a pleasure to work there."
good,"I really liked working at Regal. The people I worked with were great and most of the managers were fine to work with too. The pay was low, but that is minimum wage. The reason I had to leave there is that the scheduling was so erratic. You used to be able to change shifts if you had an issue, but then the put a policy into play that you couldn't change unless you put in a request a couple days before and then the manager had to approve it. That would have been fine if they were hurting for workers, but there were people who were requesting more work. There were also several teenagers that worked there and they kept getting scheduled to work (the time) before they were even done with school and she told them just to leave school early. I don't even think thats legal!"
good,"There is no such thing as raises unless you move to a higher position. Worked there for a year with no raise. I loved working there. Everyone is nice, but nobody cares about anything and that's why it's so great. :)"
good,There were many rushes and it was fast paced but you meet many different people. There was not many food options and the concessions was really high priced.
good,"Having relatable and down to earth management is what made this job an enjoyable one. If it weren't for that, it would have been just okay. There are good and bad days where it can be relaxed and easy and others when it's you against the clock. The job difficulty fluctuates throughout the week/year and you'll usually know when you'll be having an easy or tough shift."
good,"It was fun but they don’t respect days that you need off or allow you to request days off it does get very busy so if not used to, face paced environments it is a bit overwhelming"
good,"This is a good place to start at in your teens. You get to see all the movies you want to see with your family and friends.  Management was not the best.  If a problem arose, it was hard to get a hold of corporate to file a complaint. "
good,Micromanagement. Get ready to not have a life.  Since changes in upper level management.. Life at regal has become increasingly difficult.  I used to love the job
good,I loved working there until my 3rd year when management and employees changed and seemed to go downhill. Management played favorites and it was hard to be recognized. The 2 previous years were great. I would recommend if you know a bit about the people already there.
good,Its a run of the mill high school job. They give you minimum wage and make sure not to work you enough so that they dont have to give you any real benefits.
good,"It's an excellent job for entry level, or people putting themselves through school. I was with REG for almost 5 years, mostly in management. The company itself is mostly great to work for, but my GM is what pushed me out of the place. This job isn't for everyone. It can be high-stress and fast paced. Out of any customer service jobs, the customers at movie theaters are the worst to deal with, especially being in management. I would recommend a movie theater to work at, but again, it's not for everyone."
good,Working here is a great experience its such an easy smooth day and its easy to learn everything and the customers are really nice I like seeing the smile on their faces when I can help them with something
good,When movies are about to start then theres small or large rushes then while the movies are running there is nothing to do some the mangers have you clean literally evrything
good,"Most weekends will be very busy. New movies will come out all the time meaning there will always be a constant stream of new and returning customers. It has been top priority to give them the best experience possible within the means of the company. It taught me how widely varied customers range from, how to prep the types of food we serve, how to work on register, how to do cleaning in a that type of environment, and what to ask for in terms of availability. When I started management had been very open and accepting towards small mistakes and how each individual was different from one another. Currently they are very friendly towards customers but most of the management will be very strict to its workers or at least the more experienced ones. The staff is full of very friendly and lively individuals, willing to help and go the extra mile to help when asked or believed to be in need. Over all the hardest part might be trying to work into the groove of how things work because there is no formal training, every employee learns from other employee's and from management once they have made a mistake. Once training is complete the job then it becomes easier and just a matter of what the day will bring."
good,This company went out of Business due to funds. The management was old and was no up-to-date with the times.
good,"Overall regal was an amazing first job. Gave me opportunities to pick my hours and ask for days off that I needed. They offer discounts which makes seeing movies worth it. The general manager was very professional but very personable. I enjoyed working at a movie theater, but was not paid enough to want to stay to advance my career there."
good,This was my first job out of high school. The hours are horrible for anyone wanting a social life because working at a theater requires nights and weekends.
good,"The job was very easy, however the management made it difficult. They weren't fair to some people, giving some easier jobs than others. Also the staff and management are very underpaid."
good,Its a fast paced environment that teaches you many different skills you can use in other jobs/careers down the road. The management is ok and there wasn't much room for promotion.
good,Free movies were nice but my location had managers that played favorites and were really sexist. Male employees were treated way better than women and the women were often sexually harassed. I spent 5 years there and never got employee of the month even though I was a good worker cause I wasn’t one of the favorites. Good job to come home to for college students and they work with your schedule. You couldn’t pay me enough to work there again for the emotional trauma I went through though lol.
good,"For a first job, this couldn't have been a better. It was fast paced enough for me to really get used to the working world and learn how a real job is. i would highly recommend this as a first job."
good,"I enjoyed the job, but I did not enjoy the way the minimum wage employees were treated.  The managers were not helpful aND treated other employees as if they were lesser than them."
good,Its a fast-paced job. Management was okay sometimes they were unfair to employees. I loved all my co-workers. Hardest part was maybe working by yourself.
good,"During work,  I would run concession, take tickets, clean theaters, and sometimes help with projection. I learned how to work with a team. I enjoyed most of management. My co-worker's mostly consisted of high school kids. The hardest part of the job was trying to assist angry people, especially at night when we had people who came in drunk. The most enjoyable part of the job was that most people who came it were generally happy to be there."
good,"Before the company was bought out by Cineworld, it was a great company to work for. While working here, I had the best management and co-workers, and the customers were not so bad. Now this workplace is way stricter for employees and even customers. I would not recommend it as a first job unless you really want to the customer, and cash handling experience. The managers are pretty much careless after the buyout and so are the employees. The customers are most definitely the worst part of the job next to corporate. before Cineworld, I'd rate this job 10/10. After Cineworld, 0/10."
good,"Although it was a cool job, poor management and being understaffed made it extremely stressful as an usher because of how fast paced it was. The hardest part of being an usher is cleaning all the theaters once the movie is done on time. There would be multiple movies ending all at once that you had to clean as fast as possible for the next showing. Working door, you stand there for 8 hours and tear tickets while telling guests where their move was. You were not allowed to eat or drink anything while standing there. You weren't allowed to leave the podium unless you were cleaning the lobby or hallway. Box office is the best position because you get to sell the tickets and they allow you to work on homework and sit down during your down time. At the theater I worked at, they only allowed their favorite employees to work box office and they were only girls. Men are usually the ushers."
good,"This is a pretty nice place to work but you’ll be working ur butt off for extra hours, they do sometimes pay over-time and they’ll pay if you work during holidays. it’s not easy to get a raise, you’ll be on your feet for hours and only get a 35 minute break. This type of job is very fast paced because of the costumers so you have to be on top of your work. Nice discounts tho"
good,"It's OK if you need a job, the pay is really low but it was one of the easiest jobs I've ever had. You get two free movie tickets per shift worked, so that was a plus."
good,everyone there is pretty nice. You work with coworkers a lot. it is definitely a team effort. They work well with school schedules. Definitely encourage to apply.
good,"I really enjoyed work for Regal. I worked in the diner at the Warren theater in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. Do not want to quit but had an emergency that caused me to have to move back to Bartlesville, Oklahoma"
good,"Very chill but it’s just to make some money, can be stressful at times but usually isn’t. The pay is poor and there isn’t really any healthy options to eat during breaks. Rushes are tough to deal with."
good,In my experience the management at my theater was immature and often fraternized with the employees. The work culture at work wasn't very hardworking and there was favoritism between the employees and management.
good,"Your work load will vary based on where you are assigned. "
good,"Most of my peers seemed to be going through the daily motions rather than coming to work excited to perform. I think it has to do with the constantly repeating music. If they had just changed how the music is rotated, I think employees would be more happy to work."
good,"I remained at Regal for 3 years because of the ability to go on school leave. Meaning, I could go to school during the year, and return on breaks and holidays and still have a job to come back to. Not a hard job, but also very low hourly pay. Maximum for non managers is about $8.15/ hour."
good,The job was great at first you get good hours for the first couple months. Some mangers are unprofessional. A typical work day was at cashier and making popcorn.
good,"A typical day would delivering incredible customer service to customers buying food or tickets."
good,"You will have to work weekends and all holidays, but they are great for if your still in school. They work well around schedules in both floor staff and part time management. The only down fall is the dead season (about 4 months a year) when you hardly get any hours."
good,"Management needs a clean house. Few do actual work and hiring process for new managers is insanely slow. Poor corporate policies on manager hiring. Overall, the company location in Frederick, MD is very poor. Policies are preventing staff that would make excellent managers from becoming one due to silly circumstances that can be solved with a waiver."
good,Good starter job for young adults just starting out. Hours can be rough with being open so late during the week/weekend. Fun job and enjoyable coworkers/management relationship.
good,fun job you get too watch free movies but the managers didnt make the job easy. with seven managers and seeing four different ones a day the job can become hectic
good,"I loved working at Regal but as the two years went on, the management declined and I realized I did not want to work here anymore. I learned many skills with talking to customers and station cleanliness. I made many memories and lasting friendships at Regal with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was working on busy days like the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and working on Christmas days because it was constantly busy and I rarely stopped moving and had to be smart with quick response time. The most enjoyable part of this job was the simplicity of it and it was easy to understand and therefore easy to help fellow employees and customers."
good,"Working at Regal I learned how to deal with difficult customers as well as unorganized management. I learned to take initiative when needed and worked to get assignments finished efficiently. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management, the most enjoyable was getting to know our regular customers."
good,"Employees felt ""close-knit"" and family-like. Management was very personable and approachable. Enjoyed working during transition from 35mm film to complete digital."
good,The hardest part of the job was having to be their crazy hours after closing. The most enjoyable part of the job was to be able to watch free movies.
good,"A fun, relaxed working environment. I was able to meet most of my friends here. transformed my love for the cinema into a whole new level."
good,on weekends its the most busy and week days are very slow but its ok working there. i just don't like how they cut down hours and they have no full time positions.
good,learned to work cash register and also some sales skills when trying to recruit people to join crown club
good,"fun job, not enough hours given, no specific job duties. that is all very old job"
good,They can be very flexible with your schedule. The best part about the job is that they would give everyone 2 free movie tickets every day. It was good to work here before I went to college
good,Regal is a great place for watching movies ....that’s about it. Working there was really stressful and the management did not make it any easier. The micromanage everything you do and watch you like a hawk thru the surveillance camera.
good,Regal entertainment was my first job and I would highly recommend anyone in high school looking for a job to look towards working at theaters. It was laid back but we all worked hard. The management was always great to be around and not intimidating like you see in some places. Perfect job for teenagers.
good,I honestly think it is a great place to work. Just not the best place for me. So if you get hired just have fun. The staff is really nice and you do get the help you need if you ask.
good,Working here was fun and I liked being able to watch free movies. The hours were not great. It was hard to predict how many hours I would receive each month.
good,"Overall it was a good starting job and flexible with hours but sometimes extremely stressful and your work load doesn’t equal the pay . Also a  very fast-paced  job especially on opening of premieres, weekends , and summer !"
good,My communication skills have improved since working and my customer service as well the only problem for me is that the pay doesn't match the amount of work that I do or the work that I am asked to do.
good,"There are days where you'll be under a lot of pressure because of a new and famous movie coming out; But, it balances out because there are super slow days where you'll only see a few customers. Management always worked around my schedule and tried to make everyone feel comfortable. Working a customer service job is not easy but the employees made it a fun-filled environment."
good,"I had a good time working at Regal. I've met some lifetime friends, the people they hire usually are amazing! Managers are tough but because they care. Everyone does their best to work together. The work place is very team oriented."
good,Loved working at the theater. I would just suggest to stop promoting KIDS to management! They don't care about there jobs and it is a reflection on the employees!
good,"I and managers showing up late, and when there were times I could advance in my job, they didn't now how to help. The pay wasn't worth it because the people who did less work got tips."
good,The pay is minimum wage and the hours are not desirable when you must work till midnight and work at 9 am the next morning. The employees got 2 free movie tickets a day and 1/2 off the consesions.
good,"At the time, I hated working here. Looking back on it, I had a blast working for Regal. It's a good part-time job for high school or college students still living at home. Career advancement is unlikely, but possible. Old management used to give quarter raises every six months then 50 cents annually. Free movies and discounted concessions."
good,A typical day at work would be to serve all day while maintaining a clean environment. Then as the shifts comes to a close you clean so morning shift can focus on  serving. The management was decent and did their job. Id say the hardest part of the job would have to be staying their late nights cleaning.
good,"The job is very easy to start off with. during the summer it can be relatively busy but during the school year it can be very calm. Management is very easy going, and the pay isn't bad for a high school student but the hours are very brutal lots of 5:30 pm to midnight shifts during the week."
good,Learned quick money exchange; The hardest part of the job would be customer service. the easiest part of the job is the shift change. The workplace culture is very family orientated.
good,Regal says a great place to work if you’ve got something else going on in you’re life. Whether it be school or another job since it is primarily a part time job. The tasks were simple and you keep busy throughout your shift and the free movies and discounted concessions really made everything worth it. You worked with friends and your managers feel like equals. I loved working there but if you’re looking to live off the salary you should look elsewhere.
good,Extremely slow paced but can get busy depending on your location. (we were a hole in the wall so we didnt get too busy) Calm and relaxing place to work. Great for gaining experience. Little to no work advancement opportunities.
good,"Had a wonderful work environment, every job has its ups and downs. this one had way more up. love my management and co-workers, and just had a great overall experience working here."
good,"The co-workers were always nice, always willing to help out another employee or customer. Fast paced environment, it was a great learning environment."
good,"Fun to work and very easy, but the pay is quite low and would be much better if it started at $9 / hour at least. The managers are very nice, they can easily work around your schedule if needed. There is free movies and half off concessions."
good,"I worked every position at the company from box office, to usher and even did some maintenance work once/twice a week.  I enjoyed the Free movies, and for the most part everyone is fun it work with."
good,Within regal you will definitely learn alot of skills within this fast paced environment. Remembering everything can sometimes be hard but practice definitely makes perfect and management is willing to work with you to make sure you are good with any questions or concerns you may have..
good,"I worked this job my junior year of high-school, the job was a lot of fun due to the fact you get to see free movies almost any time you want. The work is fairly easy much of it is just selling tickets or food, and keeping the place clean. I would recommend this job for people in high-school to do to make money but have fun while they do it."
good,When I worked at the movie theatre I did the same job over and over again. I learned that to keep the auditorium clean and making sure the consumers are having a good time. The hardest part was cleaning every toilet after I just cleaned it an hour ago. The fun part of the job was going to the back of the theatre and taking out the trash.
good,"If you choose to become a closer, your shifts go from 5-1:30am to 5-3am and you'll never have an idea when it will change. Hours are never secure, especially from Jan-May. Pay is not enough for the amount of work closers do."
good,Fun place to work with free movies and popcorn. Very difficult to grow because of lack of hours due to seasonal position. Management supportive of training for enhancement in it's employees
good,Awesome first or second job not very physically demanding. if you are a movie buff then you will meet a lot of people that you can have in depth conversations about certain films.
good,"If i had to do it all over again i would. Regal was a great first job! I made friends that I still keep in touch with years later, and the customer service experience I gained I use to this day."
good,CEO and shareholder driven environment. Making to hard to satisfy customer needs. This company under staffs it's building. to reduce it's over all payroll and in turn short changing the guests. It's great that the CEO gets a half a million raise every year and that the shareholders see an increase profit. but their driving away customers!
good,Regal theatre is one of the best places to work you have the opportunity to watch movies on fridays and show your customer service skills.
good,"Working for this company has its ups and downs. But overall, it is an interesting job. Being employed with this company, I learned a lot of new things and gained experience in a wide variety of situations. The management at my location definately needs improvement. The hardest part of the job was having to learn how to deal with negative output from some of the managers working there. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to fully help my customers and knowing that I had provided an enjoyable experience for them."
good,The weekdays of course are the busy days the job duties are very easy. Everyone there seems to get along pretty good we have amazing team work. The managers are really nice and very helpful if you have any questions or concerns.
good,Regal is a great place to work for those just entering the work force.  It's an environment where you'll learn responsibility and take ownership of your actions.  You get to watch movies for free and eat all the popcorn you want.
good,"You recieve minimum wage for doing about 3-5 jobs on average. Floor staff = concessions, usher, food prep, stocker, cleaner, and anything else they need"
good,"I worked there for about a year and a half and although it can be fast paced and stressful at times, it’s a good beginners work environment. You will learn customer service and money handling skills, along with keeping areas clean and ready for use."
good,I enjoyed working at Regal with great atmosphere with other employees and great benefits as well. The actual work depends on the location you work at wether it’s busy or not.
good,"It’s not the worst, but could definitely be much better. It would be nice if we made more money and was able to get over time. It would be nice if they offered a night shift cleaning crew instead of having someone else come do it for us."
good,New management is horrible with no regard to their employees. Corporate manages are more worried about micromanaging their employees then giving them proper training
good,I’ve worked here for over a year and it isn’t a bad place to work. Management could be more appreciative of their staff. Benefits used to be better when I started then they cut some out.
good,The only problem i have is the pay. I only get $600 to $900 a Monty and i can't live with that so i have to find another job to be ablento have gas amd food to eat.
good,"This is a great part-time job while attending college full-time. They are very flexible with the schedule. Great way to experience learning customer service, customer satisfaction, and team work."
good,I left because i knew that if i got a raise it wouldn’t matter as soon as minimum wage went up. Dedicated long term employees get no recognition for their work. Was a lot of favoritism with managers. Hated the three strikes your out rule. It made the environment uncomfortable and nerve wracking.
good,Regal has been a decent company to work for minus the new changes with the buy out which is making the company look bad. Things use to be fun at work and then the new company Cineworld took over and they care more about the buildings being clean and paper work up to date then the customer. The only plus side is getting to see movies for free but even now they are taking more away from workers. Some of the managers are great but others don't care about anything.
good,Working with Regal is a very easy going environment. Everyone who works there has a positive attitude and management really makes an effort to be readily available for their staff.
good,Work is very busy during the nights and weekends. Mornings and weekdays go by slow. All depends on holidays and what kind of movies are out. There is opportunities to move up as well if interested.
good,They are very flexible & helpful to the schedule. Everyone gets along in a nice environment. Good experience working with many different kinds of people. I enjoy working here.
good,"Not worth too much of your time. Spend a year or two, maybe go for manager, but do NOT spend more than 5 years here. Raises are laughable. No sense of advancement."
good,This job is very fun from a first job poit of view but it seems like everyone likes to start drama and I'm not into that kind of stuff two people already quit because of it.
good,"It's a fun first job, if you like movies it's great because you can get into them for free. But there's no room for advancement besides management, which makes everything you do there feel unnecessary. I just didn't really care because there was no way they would fire me but I also had no reason to apply myself."
good,"I loved working with just about everyone there. I learned how to get task done quickly and efficiently due to silly competitions. The environment was wonderful, I just needed a raise or to move up but it was not going to happen."
good,"Unless you're the general manager or assistant general manager, your job is temporary or made for 16 to 25-year-olds. It's a first time job through and through and there's nothing wrong with that but if you're looking to move up within a company, this is not it. I really enjoyed working here and it got stressful at the end when the corporate office tried to cut costs buy scheduling less people so one employee had to take on the responsibilities of two but I would still recommend this job to anyone looking for their first job or something part time."
good,"great work enviorment, sun and engourging managers. its very quiet and slow most of the time but it can pick up drastically. regal entertainment group helped me gaingreat customer service skills"
good,It was fun to work there but sometimes the managers are very unorganized. Sometimes managers don't care about your personal issues and are not willing to work with you on your availability.
good,Typical day at work making sure you are promoting the regal offers of the month. Smile and greet customers. Hardest part of the job is being short staffed when ushering.
good,Working at Regal was very fun and gave me some work experience. I learned how to handle difficult customers and tough situations. The management was nice and well organized. Everyone at the workplace was kind and energetic. The hardest part of the job was cleaning up after people but the most enjoyable part was meeting new people and being in a fun environment.
good,"The  pay wasn't great unless you were in upper management, but if you are in college or don't have too many expenses this is a great place to work.  Lots of free hand outs and entertainment."
good,The management was very rude and unsimpetic and was very ungrateful for the employees. The employees were rude and not nice to customers. I didn't enjoy the crazy hours for the pay
good,It was a great first job to get while still in high school. At times it would get extremely busy but it was a good learning experience to joggle multi tasking duties.
good,Typically I would come in they would tell me where they needed me.There was a lot of focus on team work and even though you were assigned one job we all helped out each other with whatever we needed to release some strain. I worked the usher stadium and also concessions mostly. The management truthfully did not have that much respect for the staff but some were nice. I loved my co workers we were like a little family and instantly became friends! The hardest part of the job may have been the rushes of people that would come all at once for the movies but I leaned to operate under that pressure and soon it became second nature. The most enjoyable part of the job was just having one because I really enjoyed my coworkers and I was making money and of course the free movies haha.
good,"It takes a special person to be a nurse, it even takes a more of a special person to be a case manager, I love my job in dealing w/ patients, family members, doctors and nurses"
good,"Cashiering,Box office,Customer Service,Food Prep,Product Knowledge. Preparing for major movie releases."
good,"A typical day of work is quite boring because we are not a very popular location, maybe 200 each day come to see a movie on a weekday. The floor management is very nice and understanding but the higher up management is not so understanding with how work should be done. The hardest part of the job is getting out so late each night, as a high school student I should not be getting off work past 11:30 each night. I believe the closing duties could mostly be done throughout the night and not only after closing. The best part of the job was getting to socialize with new people each day."
good,Easy job that requires very little and is relatively easy all around. Requires virtually no knowledge or experience in order work this job.
good,I like my job. Management has their favorites so they don't treat everyone fair and that sucks. My co-workers are nice and I get along with everyone. The hardest part about my job can be dealing with the angry customers.
good,The work day isn't particularly hard some cash handling and customer service here and there. Its the people you work with especially in management that are really difficult to get a long with at least at the location that i worked at. My GM and assistant GM were two of the most aggravating and childish people i have ever met. They belittled people and favored people over others turning blind eyes to some and pinpointing others. it was a target on your back kinda work environment. The floor staff however was the best part about that job everyone got along and it was a good work environment.
good,"It's a good easy job. I've been working there for two years now and you learn a lot about self control, patience. The only bad part is dealing with rude customers and some of the managers are very unprofessional."
good,"Slow days at work, not enough hours, learned better communication skills, coworkers are all friendly, no hard parts, everything is enjoyable besides concession stand."
good,Easy job just got to constantly clean and make sure customers are able to find the food items they like and which movie they are supposed to be in and make sure the projectors are running smoothly
good,It was a good high school/ college job. It did not come with guaranteed hours as well as there was not a set schedule. Management was good until they brought in a new general manager. There are good benefits such as free movies.
good,"A lot of nights and weekends, but a great first job. Really teaches you how to deal with a lot of people quickly, while also teaching how to defuse situations."
good,This was a great job for the time. I was young and inexperienced and it taught me how to work as part of a team and improved my work ethic due to the fast paced environment.
good,I was pregnant while I was a staff worker and I was treated politely and able to work the box office instead of the concessions.
good,There is no one working there anymore from when I was there. When I worked at Parkway Plaza I was underpaid.  Being underpaid made it more challenging to deal with unruly customers when the higher ups wouldn't respect your decision. Getting undermined as a manager by the General Manager was one of the main reasons I left.
good,"A typical day working concession stand at Regal involves taking customers orders, food prep, and cleaning. I learned a lot about how to handle cash and customer service. Customers are generally agitated with how high prices are and can sometimes be a pain. Management is so/so. Some managers are very friendly and helpful and others clearly don't care. The major flaw of the management is scheduling. They often schedule too many people on days that are never busy which results in workers getting sent home as many as five hours early without pay. My co-workers are generally very friendly and make the job enjoyable considering there is a lot of down time between rushes. The hardest/worst part of the job is when you're scheduled to close concession.. I've been there as late as 1 AM. The best part of the job is the pay, when I started I never expected to be making 25 cents above minimum wage. "
good,"While I enjoyed the people I worked with, there were days when so much work was piled on us. Everyone tried to help each other out, but sometimes it's so busy."
good,"Typical day at work consists of working in concessions and upselling customers as much as you can while still maintaining the ""Regal"" experience. Then you go on to clean theaters, which depending on the actual movie can be really quick and easy or horribly long and disgusting. Management specifically at Edwards Calabasas is really flexible and nice. They are very easy to talk to and they are enjoyable to work with. Co-workers are easily relatable especially if you are in high school or college. Hardest part of the job is probably cleaning theaters, most enjoyable is probably watching movies. "
good,Very demanding job that keeps you on your toes. Never a dull moment.
good,"Very good, exciting and fun place to work. The people make the place worth working there."
good,"Business comes in waves throughout the year, expect to work every holiday. Christmas is the busiest day of the year. Great first job to have, met great people."
good,"The theater business is what you make it. if you want to have fun, you'll have fun. The customers, for the most part, were warm and friendly. I was even prayed for once by a customer."
good,"This position was my first work experience after high school. It laid the foundation for customer service and cashier skills. The management was supportive, and free movies was an added bonus."
good,"it’s a very simple job i started of as an usher cleaning movie theaters which would be sweeping up popcorn from isles n picking up trash , i was then switched to box where i would sell tickets n some days i’d pick up shifts for concessions selling food"
good,"Fantastic environment, really fun coworkers and professional management, but not too harsh. Fast-paced, team-oriented work in concessions as well as mindless grunt work as an usher, i loved it."
good,"It's a good workplace for a beginner. Easy work in an environment that isn't too hard nor busy all the time (dead times are frequent). Solid perks for movie lovers or casual people alike. Busy weekends, don't expect to get as many off as you'd like."
good,"Loved my job , knew what was required of me each day and was left to go about doing my job without constant supervision, communication is key to success and working as a team"
good,"When I worked there it was pretty fun. You do have to get crossed trained in all positions but if you’re good at one particular position most likely they’ll have you work there. "
good,The environment and workload is stressful enough the managers make it no better they speak to you and treat you like dogs. Trust me they’ll never fail to inform that you’ll be replaced in the blink of an eye not worth it
good,I have loved the experience of working here but need to move on. I need different hours and need to have different opportunities. They have provided me with the skills I will need at the next job and my future career as well.
good,"Great place to work for young kids just starting out, or someone looking for a little bit of extra income. Not a difficult job, sometimes a little fast paced but it all comes in waves as the movie sets start and end."
good,"I love the staff I worked with , I think thats what i enjoyed most. I think the hardest part about the job was counting the safe in the morning . I learned to have more patients with the customers when they complain about things."
good,Our day usually started with prpeparation for the day and would get very busy when we had movie showings because of us being the only theatre in the area.
good,"Regal is a great entry-level position for college-aged or young adults getting into a big business atmosphere. From cleaning theaters to management schedules and HR services, Regal has a little bit for everyone. There are good opportunities for promotion in your theater and transferring to another, but those chances don't ever seem to come up that often. Working for a theater can depend on the time of year and big releases, so scheduling can be either really good or not much at all. Overall, great job with minimal complaints."
good,About a year working at the movie theatre. I'm happy to say that I made as many friends than i'd expected from when I first applied. Aside from working almost every position for the theatre I have learned a lot. The job was able to help me discover how consistent I was with my work. Overall i'm so grateful for my experience working here and i'm only going to be learning a lot more in future jobs to come.
good,"Hours would be hard sometimes while going to school, but overall was good. Pay wasn’t too great but for a first real job it was fine. I liked working there for the few months I did, but unfortunately ended up being fired because I had to move in with my father and couldn’t get to work all the way from owasso."
good,"Regal is a fast paced work environment, lovely coworkers and management but pretty hectic during peak seasons. You are constantly busy, moving, and helping guest."
good,"I did walk out, in 2016 but it wasn’t even because I didn’t feel like working. Management was not good at the time. I did like some managers but not all. It was a great job and is a great job for those up and coming"
good,"Greeting customers, cleaning theaters, making sure the lobby and bathrooms are clean and stocked on our downtime and also complete perimeter checks and removing any graffiti."
good,"See all the free movies you want (w a guest!), snack on popcorn during breaks, fight the losing battle of keeping the kitchen clean and make sure you don't burn yourself on the popcorn popper."
good,Working at a movie theater can be an awesome experience depending on your location. Some locations are so busy that you never get a chance to learn all the aspects of working at a theater.
good,"Miss working at the theatre. And mostly miss the castmemeber And management team. But with new policy's in place, employees were no longer getting the  incentives that made them want to work for the company in the first place."
good,"Gives a chance for one to start small and work your way up, with flexible hours and accommodating pay. Regal Cinemas sets a foundation to reach better heights."
good,It was a fun first job where I made many new colleagues. From cleaning theater to working concession to selling tickets it was all good training. Rush hour was pretty hectic especially on holidays but it was definitely a great first job.
good,"I am quite thankful that Regal decided to hire me as a bartender with some experience, where I was able to expand my knowledge. The only thing I really disliked about Regal, is that corporate has no idea how to run a bar.Came up with ridiculous rules that almost made no sense that would drive guest away and discourage them to want to order anything at the bar."
good,It was a lot of fun but difficult hours and not many opportunities to advance but they give free tickets to every theater in the US which is nice when traveling and half off discounts on concession items
good,"Staffing an training were consistent issues."
good,Loved working at regal and the discounts that you received. Perfect place for a teen or a first time job. Teaches you how to work as a team with fellow staff members and how to stick to a schedule.
good,This company is great to work for for people who are looking for a first job in high school or just out of high school. Relaxed work hours and quality management made this job really easy going and fun as well as rewarding.
good,it is a good environment to work at and friendly people to work with the location. The costumers will bring good vibes to the stand and i will provide what they need for their movie.
good,"This is a great first job for anyone. You do everything you see when you go to the movies! Mostly working concessions, box office, and cleaning the theaters when people are done watching the movie."
good,Its a good starter but if you get comfortable you will be stuck there. Most of the management had higher career goals but the perceived security has allowed them to grow timid.
good,"I worked here as a teenager. It was a great first job to have, and the perks of free movies definitely made it better. The managers were helpful and available, the jobs were varied, and the chance to learn new things was always there if you were ready to accept it."
good,On weekends it can get busy if a good movie comes out that people wants to see. Its different types of culture that work with regal and the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the floor staff  working with them and getting to know the customer as well.
good,"Working at a movie theater can be very stressful. There are many positions in the theater that you could be placed in on any given day. You have the box office, concessions, kitchen, door, usher and bar. I usually found myself rushing to get customers their tickets or food so they could make their movie on time. With all that stress $7.75 an hour isn’t enough pay for all of the duties you have to fulfill in the theater. But the free movies are a plus."
good,"This place is great as a first job or a summer employment. It's quick paced during the holidays but excruciatingly slow the rest of the year. Most people I know that work there are retirees (just to keep themselves busy) or teenagers. It's a good place to manage at, but the company is not good at giving merit based raises, and their loyal employees they tend not to acknowledge. Management at this location is amazing though, very easy going and considerate. It's a family."
good,"I learned a lot of things at Regal cinemas. Like customer service, cashier experience, usher experience. The management is not the best but not too bad either. The hardest part of the job is that it is super busy whenever a movie comes out and chances are you will not get much time to rest. The most enjoyable part of the job is free movies."
good,"I was hired as a manager, and it was very stressful because expectations was very high.  Cleanliness, customer service, and customer satisfaction was the ultimate goal."
good,Being an associate manager at Regal Entertainment Group is a pretty nice job. You learn a lot about how it is to run a company. It is an important work position that gives a lot of managerial experience.
good,"Good starting job for teens - gain lots of useful employment skills (customer service, cash handling, food preparation and sales, cleaning, Very patient manager."
good,"Regal is a great place to work for just some extra money, but you cannot live off the salary. I've worked there for two years and most days I feel like its the same stuff every day. It's great for highschool students or summers. Great job to be your first job high energetic, quick pace, lots of cleaning, and number one customer service."
good,good start job for teens. staff was nice and so was management. i would very recommend to work here to make some cash while in school. good was to move up in company.
good,Good money handleing skills learned and also customer service you learn a lot about customer service. You also learn how to keep track of stock and learn how to use a register and keep track of your money in the register
good,Everyone worked together and were eloquently placed in their respective roles. Management was always a plus at this establishment. Another plus was getting into any movie fore free
good,Worked here in high school. liked it and the free movies were cool. overall i would work there again if given the chance. it was a good place to work.
good,I enjoyed working at regal majestic cinema located at silver spring Mary land .I was working as usher which is cleaner  I was cleaning the all building by going to every auditorium and also clean the hall was I was also working as a ticket controller at the front door my job was to make sure that people have their ticket write before entering the auditorium
good,This job isn’t the place to go make a career. This is a place to kill time and make money on the side but it is very hard to live on just this jobs salary so this shouldn’t be a main option. The people are nice enough and the managers are okay
good,"This job has been very good to me, met some of the best people i know, but its time to move on and advance to bigger and better things. The benefits were alright, felt underpaid since I started working there. Management is nothing special, the changes that happened were unnecessary. There has been a great amount of turnover floor staff wise since i started working there. Like I said this jobs been great dealing with school, and the scheduling. In the long run, career movement isn't likely and isn't really worth it, the company keeps getting stingier and stingier and it will only go so far. I do not approve the direction where the company is going. therefore I'm finding my way out."
good,"Its a difficult job with long hours but free movies is always fun! I love movies, which is why i chose this job. Being able to watch movies for free was a huge benefit for me."
good,"Usually coming in early for work, It gets pretty busy with new movies coming out almost every week. Managers always check how I'm doing and making sure everything's on schedule and caught up. There are days where it can be frustrating to deal with both colleagues and customers but it comes with the job."
good,Wasn't hectic unless a popular movie just released and even then wasn't too much of an issue as long as you are able to manage your time and work responsibilities correctly
good,"Fine. Popcorn, drinks, ice cream. Clean theaters. Greet guests. Many friends and bonds created with customers. Great movie options and cleanliness is good."
good,Great place with fun people but managers seemed to be underprepared some of the time and this company has little room for advancement. This is a great first/summer/flexible for school job.
good,This job gave me a lot of good customer service and management experience. It was great until I decided I wanted to settle down and stop getting off work at 2am on occasion.
good,When I was a part of Regal Cinema's team I was a minor. They would schedule me until midnight and I did not have transportation. I could not find the manager who had hired me. So I was unable to continue working for them.
good,"Its an okay place to work if you're a student , won't give you many hours , and won't  ever give you full time unless you're a manger . But still laid back place to work"
good,"I loved this job. The customers, movies, and free popcorn were all great. Some of the managers have attitudes and treat employees bad. Most of the time, the managers can be cool, but once frustrated they talk to employees disrespectfully. I even experienced a manager throwing a box of 3D glasses all over the place, because they were in her way. Overall, I had a good experience working there."
good,Regal is a very easy to learn and quick to pick up style business. I was promoted to associate manager in just 6 months. However due to the nature of business being an entertainment business. We see very heavy business depending on the product that is currently released. This can lead to a heavy workload as satisfying the many customers will overlap your other management responsibilities.
good,"Omaha stadium 16 was an enjoyable place to work at. the staff is friendly, as well as the managers. it was and still is my first job, and I had a fantastic time working there. but now, with the skills that I've accrued, I'm ready for a job with a sufficient hourly pay."
good,Regal is a very large company with a strong work culture put into place. I got very lucky and worked under managers that were fun and caring but that does not go for all managers at other regals.
good,This job is very fast paced at times and then gets super slow. The best part of the job are the free movies and the concession discounts. Highly suggest for a first job.
good,"I really didn't mind the job overall but I absolutely hated working alone, and I prefer to work with more than one person, or with the customers directly and management didn't listen to me when I told them."
good,I got to hire and train people. We made customers happy. The hardest part was solving customer service problems and dealing with difficult employees. The GM was a great person.
good,"Not a very trusting supervising staff, co-workers are exceptional. Benefits are very limited, but the resources are there; they offer 401K, and free movies."
good,A typical day at regal cinema would be a fun overall experience. What i learned at regal cinema is my social skills more than anything from talking to customers and communicating with employees.
good,"This was my first job and it was a decent one. I got paid well, and I learned a lot of useful skills. However, even now, 3 years later, I can't stand the smell of popcorn. Also the free movies were super cool!"
good,Working at the movie theater was an enjoyable job that provided good customer service and communication skills for future employment opportunities. The management and other employees help you along the way with learning the ways of the movie theater business and show you how to do something if you are struggling with it.
good,"Regals is a job where you learn , grow , and to have fun. The job may seem stressful but the managers and employees are very friendly. Regals is all about a safe environment to work in."
good,"I learned how to count money quickly, and work with disgruntled customers.  The workplace culture is not quite extensive.  The hardest part of the job is the customer. The most enjoyable part is the paycheck and the movie passes."
good,"There is something at Regal for everyone.  The job security can last you a lifetime, and it's a wonderful company to work for if you like to stay fit and active."
good,Its a good place to start but it wasn't my favorite job. You have to be flexible with hours because they aren't consistent whatsoever. Also you must be good at customer service.
good,The movies at Regal was my first job and it was a great first job. It is not a job you would want to make a career. It gave me skills in how to count money and provide customer service.
good,As a floor staff I tried to excel to the needs of my employer and customer satisfaction to maintain a good record. Depending on the schedule I was assigned to my post and required to do the basic job requirements.
good,"I have been a part of this company off and on for 4 years. I can honestly say they are a great corporation to work for, and treat their employees amazingly."
good,"Enhances financial management skills and social skills. I enjoyed working there, but management did not give accommodations for my disability"
good,"Everyone there treated each other like family, and it was a great pleasure working for this company. I worked for the Huntersville location. Some nights were tiring because I was progressing in my pregnancy. However, the management worked very well with me. I will forever be grateful for those I've worked with at Regal BIrkdale Stadium 16& RPX."
good,"You learn a ton of customer service skills here. Unfortunately you do not have a set schedule so hours may very, making it very hard to plan anything, but the job is flexible."
good,"management was pretty fair, hours are not consistent but overall a good experience. Free movies is most likely the best part of the job"
good,I learned how to care for customers under a lot of pressure. I had to ignore the long lines yet be conscientious of all the people that were waiting. I learned plenty of patience.
good,"I was able to work any station, but they would over staff and send people home a lot. It was very hard to make money. I loved the people I worked with. We were all very close."
good,"- relatively easy in the morning but progressively got harder as the day continued"
good,Fun job and really enjoyed the management. This is a perfect first job for any high school student. Fun Christmas parties. After working for a while they would train you in concessions and box office.
good,"Working with the general public for minimum wage is never a good idea, especially with a college education. That being said I will not be returning there to work."
good,"Great atmosphere, I've learned a lot about customer service thanks to regal, and the co-workers are easy to get along with."
good,"Fast paced"
good,"In the concession stand, we were responsible for selling and serving food, and drinks. Ushers maintained a clean, safe environment. And projectionists took care of any problems with projector or sound towers."
good,"I worked mostly concessions, especially when I first started. Of course all positions were easy. Most of my coworkers were high school kids, so it was mostly a fun and care free environment. The managers were the same, often fairly laid back as long as we did our job well. This may not always be the case as I had heard from other theaters that they had harsh managers, and one theater was well known for being over-the-top strict, as we received several transfers from that same theater. Over all it was a fun first place to work, though the pay is terrible and hours schedules fluctuate wildly. I learned a lot about how to work with guests though and it taught me a lot about dealing with coworkers and superiors as well. The worst part was dealing with the blind checks, which were done every month and the results were often reported incorrectly, management would frequently dispute the blind check reports."
good,"I loved all my managers and coworkers. You don't get paid enough for all the detailed cleaning that we have to do and deal with daily, prices are a little high. Other than that, it's a great place to work as a first job."
good,I would love to work for this company again. It was my first job and I loved every minute of it. I liked my coworkers and what my job entailed.
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Great employee benefits. Working here definitely helped sharpen my people skills and my work ethic while under pressure.
good,"I was at Regal for some time and I will have to say I really enjoyed working there. I loved getting free movies and meeting new customers everyday. I've been there long enough to see some customers become regulars/loyal customers due to the services that  we provide. If you treat your guest as family, you too will become family to them =)"
good,"Constantly busy. All the job positions require you to use a lot of energy. We're all very friendly and complete all customer's satisfaction. This is a very tiring job, I think our salary should be just a little bit higher."
good,"Fairly new company to Hawaii.  At the time I was employed there, the management did not know what they were doing! They hired and fired very easily."
good,Working at Regal was an Ideal job. The environment were great. I was a team player and self starter. I enjoyed being employed at Regal.
good,Regal Entertainment Group is a fast paced work environment that is constantly changing. New movies bring fresh crowds and the constantly changing menu provides a challenge each weekend. Free movies are a nice perk!
good,It was okay working here I only stopped because they closed down. they were a little unorganized but they were fair. It consisted of a lot of work.
good,Regal is one of the cleanest and overall nicest theaters in my area due to their oftentimes extremely strict attitude toward their workers. Overall it was a good string job to get my feet wet.
good,I am here because my coworkers have become my family; the hours might be long but everyone gets along great and collaborates as a team.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of reporting to your department, oversee workers, make sure your department runs smooth, handle cash transactions, and ensuring guest have the best experience possible. The co-workers are pleasant to work with, fun and energetic. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers, while the most rewarding part is seeing the guest leave happy and continue to return."
good,It's a good job if you are young with no real responsibilities. The pay is low considering how much money the business makes. The work required is way above the pay rate.
good,"It's a great place to work, and I've made some life long friends here."
good,"A manager's day begins, continues, and ends with the focus being on balancing payroll costs with 100% customer service. It is an exiting challenge and allows different managers to come together as a TEAM to achieve the goals set before us. It is great working with such a variety of characters, and the environment is always open and friendly. I have learned so much from my co-workers, both professionally and personally."
good,"typical day - counting cash drawers and preparing the concesions and box office for business"
good,Just your run-of-the-mill minimum wage job.  Easy going. Fun enjoying free movies.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is exceeding guest expectations and providing the most enjoyable experience for each guest.
good,"What you would expect from working at a movie theater. Minimum pay, extensive hours, demanding management."
good,Most of the people that work at Regal Cinema are college and high school students. For the high school student they would give them reasonable hours during the week abut on the weekends would have them work until 2 am. With the college students they would work until 2 am weekdays and weekends.
good,"A day on the job is always busy with movie goers."
good,Working for Regal Entertainment Group was a fun and exciting experience. I was able to interact with the public on an everyday basis and enjoyed the satisfaction customers would have after visiting our location.  The management was wonderful. All were hard-working individuals who only wanted to make sure the customers enjoyed their visit.
good,"Typical day at work consists of mostly motivating staff and assisting patrons. Learned more about what goes on behind the scenes of running a movie theater, how to manage projection booth, how to delegate orders to a team of workers, and how to audit a theater."
good,Regal provides it employees with a sense of empowerment and provides them with great benefits.
good,"Flexible Schedules, Fun filled environment. Willing to work with you and schedule around your life."
good,Not Bad. Easy work. Comfortable however floor staff can be a few various jobs and some of them are harder than others. STILL A COOL PLACE TO WORK.
good,"Great place to start for a first time job. Easy workloads, reasonable hours and great people as coworkers."
good,"It's always busy on the weekends, but a fun place to work. Scheduling was very flexible and I always got a decent amount of hours. But it's only good for part time. Don't expect more than minimum wage unless you're a manager, but there's not a lot of room to move up though."
good,"I did a little bit of everything, but I mostly worked as a usher."
good,"For it being my first job when I was 17 at the time, it was a lot of fun. Cleaning the theaters really opened my eyes to just how nasty people can be when it comes to not throwing their garbage, or just cleaning up after themselves in general. Some of my coworkers were nice to be around while some of them had their very minor issues, but nothing to the point where it was hindering on my overall work. Management in the beginning was great, but slowly  took a small turn when new managers were appointed, which kind of threw the balance of things off. Overall though, it was fun to work there, and being able to see a movie for free was an incredible benefit."
good,"This job is good for first time employees or students, high school and college a like. Do not expect to get too many hours though. Most of the management is fair and helpful to any concerns you may have."
good,"The hours at Regal were long based on how busy the theater would get, the location I worked for is the busiest in the Southeast area. I learned great customer service skills as well as thinking quickly on my feet. My co-workers were very flexible and willing to help each other. The hardest part of the job was the long hours and the amount of customers that you would help on a daily basis, all in all it was an enjoyable experience. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the staff, there was always a manager to say positive, upbeat things whenever we were very busy."
good,This was the best first job I could have asked for. Yea you get kind of dirty if you work in concession but the job is just fun. If you are in high school it is the best first job. I met so many people. Work was a blast everyday. The best part is you get free movie tickets everyday. I was never behind on my movies.
good,This was a place that maintained its apperance. It was hard work but it was worth the pay. However the place closed down.
good,"Full time job..."
good,Shipping and receiving of import freight to and from containers and rail cars.
good,"On a daily basis supervised staff of 40 to 60 employees. Trained personnel in sales techniques and opening/closing procedures consistent with franchise operation manual. Delegating tasks among staff in accordance with employees’ skills and abilities, treating employees with respect; maintaining a sense of humor as well as constructive criticism and input on production improvements."
good,"I worked at the Regal Cinemas from 2006-2009, and those were some of the best times of my life. For a teenager, a movie theater is the perfect job. You're surrounded by people your age and you get to watch movies for free. The best part of the job was the free movies, I used to watch movies all day on my off days. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the theaters after kids movies, those theaters are usually the worst. At Regal Cinemas, I've learned all about my customer service skills."
good,i enjoyed being able to work with people and serving people making sure they have a great time 
good,The management was very friendly and open to listen. Very helpful. Well organized and had great team work. Nice lunches but no breaks.
good,"Generally, I perform a wide range of administrative functions. The position is highly task-oriented, requiring organization, prioritization, and multitasking abilities. Also customer service-based, so the job demands interpersonal skills, including diplomacy and discretion."
good,"It is a movie theatre what can I say? It was fun because you were mostly working with people your age. But when the weekends hit, it was crazy."
good,Management is alright. Don't get paid enough for what you do.
good,I loved being an usher/ greeter and patrolling the auditoriums. I had great co-workers and the most enjoyable time was watching movies with my family.
good,Opening/closing the theater.Getting concession stand ready.Making sure that there was proper staff available. Making sure that the projectors and films were threaded correctly and started on time.Making sure that it was always a clean and friendly environment.
good,"While working at my current position I have learned a lot. I have gained precious skills that I can apply to future positions, such as skills in: customer service, cash handling, cleaning, working registers"
good,Sold tickets and developed customer service skills and developed many other great skills.
good,"A typical day consists of managing staff and payroll dependent on business levels, answering and writing emails, and pre-shift meetings with staff. It's a learning environment, just when you think you've got everything down, a new policy or change in dynamic keeps you on your toes. Communication is key."
good,Busy work place. Learn to listen and problem solve for all situations. Make guest visits enjoyable. Management was always there to support employees when needed. Co-workers were like a family and fun to be around. Hardest part was trying to keep up with the crowds during holidays and popular movies openings. Best part of the job were the perks of watching movies anytime except during work.
good,Improved on my customer service skill and clean the movie theater
good,"A very simple job to understand. Has the ability to become stressful when ""Big Titles"" are about to show."
good,overall fun job and great learnig experience with customers
good,Not too bad a place to work if you don't mind babysitting and drama.
good,concessions and cashier
good,I really enjoyed working here. I learned a lot about customer service and about the public in general.
good,"This job was a great first job, It gave me the experience to develop and grow as a professional."
good,"fun, fast, never ending and great movies and entertainment"
good,Great people to work with and for. They were always on top of it for employee and food safety. Entry level employees didn't get paid spectacularly but it was OK for a part time job. A great place for a after school job.
good,"Dealing with customers is practically a given. There's a lot of tough moments, but most of all, everything is pretty smooth. There's good people working and there's a good environment."
good,"It was my first job. It was interesting starting out, but once i got going i enjoyed it. My employees were caring & nice. My managers were understanding & helpful. They worked well around my schedule during the time i was a student athlete. Which was very helpful."
good,You become really close with your coworkers and there is a lot of down time when there are set breaks. Hours are really flexible and I feel like management cares about you as a person. Can get pretty stressful. I worked on End Game and it was crazy. Marvel releases are always crazy so be prepared for that. You get good discounts for what you’re missing out on the pay. You get 50% off concessions and every week you get two free tickets
good,I loved the fast paced rushes in the ticket booth. The concession stand was a lot more difficult for me to learn since I started when a lot of large movies were coming out but over all terrific place to work.
good,"overall my time there was my favorite job very relaxed easy going , the only thing is that the manager was a bit ... lets say particular on how he liked the place and jobs put in order. Other then that he was very understanding and I thank him for being hard on me taught me alot of good things!!! Other then that the e,employees were always a hit and miss , very immature but overall no bad beef at the time i was there . I feel like this is where you learn alot about people and some good life skills ."
good,"The staff at Regal is great; with easy to make friends and easy to talk to people. The work is slow, but it tends to be all unnecessary busy work that could be taken away."
good,"fun for a while, but it'll get to you at some point. The managers are nice, easy job. Get free movies and half-price on concessions but no other benefits"
good,"It is what you would expect from a movie theater job. Working concession, working the box office, working as an usher. It is what you would expect and not much more. However that does not make it bad."
good,"It's a great job for those seeking an interest in a movie career. Fun, exciting, easy. The management motivation can vary depending on the location but they always work hard. It is definitely a harder position the farther you move forward."
good,"I worked there for almost a decade, so I suppose I liked it. The management is cool and the employees are fun to be around. Some days are good and some days are bad."
good,Good place for first job experience and great co-worker friendships. Enjoyed interacting with new guests and talking about movies. Great job to build customer service skills.
good,"My location was well kept and organized, with one of the top locations in the whole company. Sell tickets and food from popcorn to a burger to guest and keep theaters and rest of the building clean."
good,"Regal is a great place to work. Once you have worked there for a bit you become apart of the Regal family. You get discounts on concession items, free tickets, and they work your hours around your school schedule. Management is new but is getting better."
good,"Most days are relaxing and pleasant, unless there is a highly anticipated movie coming out, then it was hectic and fast-paced. I learned a lot about how to handle situations when a customer is mad or unsatisfied. When it came to management most were pleasant to work with but, some did abuse their power because their job titles were higher up. the workplace culture was good, we all generally got along with one another. The hardest part of the job was when I closed and my peers, the manager wouldn't let people leave until about 2,3, sometimes 4 in the morning. Another hard part about the job was when their were popular movies that released, and their were a lot of people, something would always break down because some of the theatre's appliances were so old because it was an old movie theatre. The most enjoyable part of the job was that we never did the same things everyday, it was always something different, and also most of my fellow associates were great to work with."
good,"Working at Regal was really fun, especially as a floor staff. Its a lot of people's first job, you learn a lot about customer service, cleaning, and teamwork. Its mostly teenagers/young adults that work as floor staff which is really fun. As a manager you get more freedom but a lot more responsibility. All around, nobody gets paid enough. "
good,I started at regal cinemas to get my car fixed and I knew after that I would have to get a new full time job to pay for my insurance and rent but all in all regal isn’t a bad place to work.
good,"The location of my Regal Cinemas was in an area that does not have a lot of people. For this reason business was usually slow if there was not a new blockbuster out. Anytime this happened, expect to be sent home early even if you wanted the longer pay."
good,"Never worked at Movie cinemas before and I had t a blast working there. If I was to EVER have an opportunity to work for a cinema theater again, I would apply without hesitation."
good,"I was hired for a seasonal position where I would serve as an usher or a cashier depending on the need for it. "
good,"This job is one that is easy to do and comes with a great community. All of my coworkers are great, and I enjoy being at work. The customers at my particular location are sometimes hard to deal with, but that is what comes with customer service positions. As an employee, I get two free movie tickets every day, and 50% off at the concessions stand, which is really awesome. Also, management has movie posters as rewards for employee performance, which is cool. "
good,"A lot of customer interaction."
good,"I had a great time working at the Regal cinemas in Bethesda. Sadly, they closed about 2 years ago. The management was very accommodating. The managers I had during my time there were very friendly."
good,"As a first job, it can be potentially overwhelming depending on when hired, but persevering through the crowds wanting to see the newest blockbuster movie will help you out in the long run, though patience and adaptability is a necessary skill for long line days"
good,"Issues aside, because they come and go at every job, this is/was my dream job. It's fast paced but rewarding. Free movies will ALWAYS be a bonus in this economy."
good,"good starter job, advancement available if wanted to continue into college. A typical day could entail a lot of things, assignments are generally the same every day for floor staff but it can also be randomized. You'll either be doing box office, concession stand, or cleaning theaters."
good,"On a typical day it is a fast paced work environment that consists of greeting customers at the box office, concessions, and the bar. I have learned multi-tasking, customer service, and working in a team environment. As part of the workplace culture I made many friends and learned how to work with management. The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to share movie knowledge with customers, team members, and management."
good,"It is a great working environment as far as staff, but the general manager was rather difficult at times. I thoroughly enjoyed the other managers though."
good,If employed try to get into a full time position. This is a great place to start out during high school and college.  They are very flexible with school schedules.
good,"Regal is a fast-paced, productive, enjoyable place to work at. Regal works with your schedule, perfect for high school students and college students at."
good,"The environment is wonderful, the people are great to work with, but if you are looking to advance up the ranks of the theater it is nearly impossible. You get hired into a position that stops there, now it is possible to make a senior cast member but the difference between a regular cast member and a senior cast member is next to nothing. But overall I would recommend as a first time job for many people"
good,"* Hard to clock in and out. Weekdays are pretty slow paced, but weekends are seriously fast paced"
good,"Unless you have prior THEATER experience, you are starting at minimum wage. You can work five other jobs before working at Regal and if it is not a theater job, you get nothing to show for it."
good,"If you love movies you’ll love the discounts. Management is kind, friendly and understanding. Expect weekend rushes and snail paced weekdays. Strawbridged is one of the most relaxed yet efficient theaters"
good,i like working at regal however in the 10 yrs employed i havnt yet had the chance to advance to management because as i hear that for some reason the district manager doesnt like me...
good,"Fun place to be working at, but low hours and pay. The free movies are a nice plus but there is almost no opportunity to move up very much. High turnover rate."
good,"Working in a theatre is probably one of the best jobs I have ever had, the job itself was great, relaxed and easy to do.  Management overall was good, the General manager that was put there 5-6 years ago does not understand the ins and outs of the job, had to ask employees what to do, played favorites with employees, and didnt trust people even if they had been there for over 5 years."
good,"Definitely not a very fulfilling job, but the people I worked with really makes it great. Not difficult to become management. However, management takes on a lot of responsibility and is not adequately compensated."
good,"Great place to work part-time and good benefits--movie wise-- however no medical or dental benefits. Only part-time work was available, however they were willing to work with school schedule."
good,"I worked as a cashier at a Regal Cinemas theater for around a year during my high school career. It was fun while I was there, good people and management was so-so. The only thing that I can really complain was that management decided to repeatedly schedule me for closing hours during the weekdays despite knowing that I had school the next day."
good,Easy and fun job that anyone would enjoy. Lax most of the time but gets busy when new movies come out. The management is alright but could use improvement.
good,For the most part I enjoyed working there. I mostly left because my last GM was holding me back and wouldn't promote me to senior assistant when I was the most qualified after working for the company for 10 years.
good,"No benefits unless you work full time.  However job doesn't hire full time employees.  No matter your expirience you make minimum wage.  But other than that, really fun job to work at."
good,I enjoyed working at Regal because I bonded with my co-workers as if we were family and we worked as a team to get the job done and the time past quickly working with them.
good,It is a fun and enjoyable workplace.  The staff at Regal Entertainment Group were all fun and had positive attitudes. Interacting with customers at Regal Entertainment Group was also a big bonus because they all came with great energy happy to see a movie that they had been waiting for a while to come out or just coming to relax/have fun.
good,"The job security in this company is great.  There is very little turn over due to mistakes.  That being said, job advancement is difficult unless you know the right people."
good,It’s very fun and easy work when it’s not busy other than that it’s a good place to work at. You don’t get enough hours and the management could be better.
good,"The job was really based for a teenager had really nice workers, the management was not very helpful so I had to work a little more independently but it is a great first job."
good,"Looking for a first job this is a great one free movies and great money for the hours you will work ,and a lot of the people are very kind and just want to be around positivity ."
good,"*Learn a lot of basics for other jobs."
good,Regal is a fun and fast paced place to work for. You get a lot of experience with guest service and it is wonderful to interact with people. Co workers and managers are all great to work with and close with each other.
good,"Good place to work , not a lot of advancement opportunities but they do work with college and high school students on their hours.   they should be more lenient on their policies"
good,"typical day was coming in getting on a register in either the box office or the concession stand and serving customers"
good,Come into work clean movie theaters. Check if the movies playing were working okay. Work was fun because we worked around new movies. Hardest part was cleaning after a big movie coming out.
good,"When it gets busy, it can get hectic.  Expect to do a lot of standing and walking and serving customers.  They rotate you so that you know what to do for each stations"
good,There is a lot of positive reinforcement in this enviornment. No one is domineering and business is encouraged. There is a bit of downtime in no-movie season but there aren't a lot of downsides to it.
good,The benefits for the company are great.  Regal helps cover some of the premiums of insurance to keep the employee portion as low as possible.  They also look to see how to keep the all of their employees as engaged and healthy to provide a healthy environment for everyone.
good,"During my tenure with Regal, there were always opportunities to balance work/life. Strong support from upper management. Fun environment, great co-workers."
good,"start the day stocking prepping for the rush. doing theatre check, opening and closing facility counting safe and prepping cash registers"
good,Working with friends at the theater is what keeps most people able to keep working here. The pay is minimum wage and as a closer you can expect to be there until 3 in the morning or later every night.
good,"It can be very stressful, but the other workers are very nice and are willing to help. It takes some getting used to the fast paced environment"
good,While working at Regal Entertainment I was able to learn how to work with many types of customers from those who are nice and easy help to those who seem to just want to ruin your day. Because I was able to experience all types of people on a regular basis I feel like I am a very good people person now because of it.
good,"In my honest opinion i enjoyed working there, as it was never a completely unenjoyable place to work. For those first starting out in the workforce it teaches you a great many things such as Customer Service, Food Handling, and Cash Handling which many jobs take part in. It was a lot of hard work at times as there are something only the older staff such as my self could do, and was requested to do them often."
good,"it was ok when i first starting working therew. the csutomers was older it was always crazy during a new movie, the managers never really schedule enough people to work"
good,"I personally have enjoyed my experience with Regal. My coworkers instantly welcomed me into the team and was very helpful getting me on my feet at this job. I enjoy working here because I could be doing anything from selling tickets to working in the concession stand. Management is very helpful and fair to all employees. The hardest part would have to be the sometimes fast pace, it gets a little stressful. Overall i have loved my time here at the theatre."
good,"Depending on the position there are opening duties, many of which include cleaning or turning on equipment, counting into tills, and grabbing stock. It is a customer oriented job that focuses on a superior viewing experience for guests, from ticket sales, to concessions products and the movie experience. Learned how to work in a fast paced work environment that is always changing to fit the needs of the customer. Worked with money and food, and customer service and learned a great deal about each area. Management was hard working and made certain that the employees and customers were taken care of. Co-workers changed quite a bit, seasonal hiring was necessary as there are certain times when the theater is much busier than others. Hardest part of the job was learning how to use all the equipment. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, particularly the regulars."
good,"Regal is a good place to work for. The management and staff is friendly and courteous. The most enjoyable part of the job is to make our customers feel at home and make them get the Regal treatment. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers and their complaints, but nonetheless they too still deserve the Regal treatment."
good,As long as you worked the minimum amount of 20 hours a week you were allowed to go see free movies on your free time.  Management made sure breaks were taken by all.
good,"IT's a candy shop; management or floor staff; you work 2 hours taking care of customers then you get an hour and a half of down time in cleaning. Pretty easy job, and hardly any customer hassles."
good,"Being at a movie theatre you don't really have one position. You're placed wherever you're needed at that time. There were some days where I would do a bit of everything: usher, concessions, box office, ticket taker. I learned more useful customer service skills, including working a register and cash handling. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful on the job. Thanks to social media I actually keep in touch with many of them. Management was helpful whenever we got pretty busy. The hardest part of the job was probably just keeping up with cleaning when multiple theatres were being let out at one time. The most enjoyable part was getting to move around often and not be stuck in one position every day (i.e. variety)."
good,It is an easy job. The hours can be very annoying working till 1am (3am some nights) and it being open 365 days a year means I need to work on Christmas day and other Holidays. The free movies are a nice perk however.
good,Regal Cinemas was a very enjoyable place to work.  I was also able to see some great movies and meet some fun coworkers.
good,active listen to what customers would like to watch . I learned that knowing the synopsis of every movie is very helpful instead of directing them to a synopsis board ( were not required to know what every movie is about) it saves the customer time . I'm in box office alone sometimes so I am required to answer the company phone that rings often as I'm still helping other customers while I distribute their tickets . With this I learned how to multi-task efficiently . The most enjoyable part of this is interacting with customers and making them feel welcome to come back often and keeping a positive atmosphere in my work environment.
good,"I clock in, then I ask my manager what i'm assigned to do for the day, be it working concessions, or working the floor, then I get to work."
good,The typical day at Regal seemed to always be busy. I learned alot about cutoemr services while working at Regal and learned alot about managing large groups of people
good,I loved working at the theater. It was one of my favorite jobs. I just got to the point where I couldn't go any higher up. I was promised more hours and more pay and it never happened. All in all great job for someone in school or for a first job. Would HIGHLY recommend!!
good,"Working as a Regal employee was a great experience. It provided me with the tools necessary in working with people, both as fellow employees and in a customer situation. Being a movie theater, there were busy days where one had trouble gathering their thoughts and super slow days where one would create a small mess just to have something to do. It was in these moments where the positive environment would come out. I had fun with my peers on these days because no matter what it was, someone was always there to help. There was this instance where I was in the ticket booth, working with this manager in the same booth as I was. It was around the time Batman, The Dark Knight Rises came out. This customer had a coupon that allowed free admittance that he had earned through points. The only problem was that it could not be used until the day after he had come. The customer was understandably upset and he lost his temper with me. It is a terrifying experience to have a person whom is a stranger yell and loose their temper with you. However, my manager came over, sorted it out by explaining the situation to the man. He then lost his temper and tossed the coupon in my face and left. The manager had then taken me aside to make sure I was alright, offered me some time to go upstairs and sit in the break room if I needed to. The managers never carry themselves as being high and superior over others. They make it easy to approach with problems, to help with slow days by providing the allowance for small games like using empty trash bags as goals for the mini hockey games we would play on"
good,"I can use customer service, sales, cashier,housekeeping skills"
good,"I loved working in a theater. I got promoted pretty quickly too. Quite a bit to learn about inventory, money handling, and customer service. I have a lot of respect for people who work in theaters now after this job! It can be crazy!"
good,I loved working this place near customers. They always had a smiley and happy face and I always did what i could to keep them happy. I would open or close the store and make sure the box office and concession stand were ready for the customers. My coworkers always worked hard and worked together to make sure everyone was treated the same.
good,your co workers are like family so it makes it a productive and fun workspace.
good,My specific theater was the LA Live branch. It has great people and managers but work is fast and precise.
good,I can encounter anywhere from 500-1000 customers with in a hour and a half time span. I learned how to be proficient at multi-tasking in a fast pace environment. I have a good working relationship with all managers and co-workers.
good,Start work at your designated time and it is all about team work there.
good,Work was easy with some occasional late nights. Management had lazy moments but could be very much helpful. Some co-workers just griped and others were hard workers. hardest part of the job was closing at the end of the night and making sure EVERYTHING is clean. But the people made the job enjoyable.
good,A typical work day would be long but the co-workers made it fun. Management was great some time there was favoritism.
good,"interesting staff to work with, flexible hours, mostly young staff, hours, depending on season, varied greatly"
good,"Employees and management are really nice to work with. Free movie perk is really nice too. Unfortunately you start at minimum wage, and opportunities for advancement are hard to come"
good,"Selling tickets to customers and cross-selling meals(i.e. Popcorn, soda, candy, nachos, ice cream, bottled water etc.). Everything was about cross-selling bigger meals. Decorating for upcoming movies."
good,A typical work day included working nights at the concession stand. I learned alot about customer service.
good,Management was always disrespectful and actually got caught money laundering and the pay there was trash and I worked way harder than I was paid and there was so much drama because of a younger staff
good,"Pros: Regal is a very inclusive, friendly and fun establishment to work at. Great coworkers and Crew Member team. "
good,It is an extremely fast paced job. There are many times you have to think on your feet and keep on top of things. Everyone likes to make sure that you are well informed on different aspects of the job and if not they are more than happy to teach you.
good,Regal right now i think is not a good place to work if you expect to move up fast. I think they could have been doing raises but they decided to not do them for almost a whole year. Other than that I don't really have any complaints because most of the staff I work with is great and i really enjoy working at Regal. The free 2 movies a week and half off concessions is a nice bonus.
good,"Regal was a great place to work. the customers will stress you out and drive you crazy, so be prepared for that. the managers were amazing, very understanding. But majority of the time for me I was understaffed due to people calling out. So it seemed that I had a lot more work to do than I should have done. I also closed on almost all my shifts. Sometimes I got out at 1:30 am sometimes 3:00 am. So if you are closing just be prepared to stay late."
good,"While working there I would have to clean theaters, sell concessions, restock items, and make certain foods. The management was pretty lenient and make sure we always have something to do."
good,"greeting customers, relaxing, fast pace and slow pace on the same day."
good,I was able to maintain a steady work pace. There was not any problems I did not have a problem solving. I enjoyed being able to help out my co workers. Everyone was very kind and able to show me the ropes. The staff showed great teamwork in which I was able to work more efficiently.
good,"When it's slow, it's super slow. But when it is busy (release weekends, 3AM showings), it is very fast paced and tiring. "
good,"I loved my time working at regal, definitely a good first job for someone. Met a lot of great people working there, had fun while still learning how it is working an actual real job"
good,"Good place for people trying to get their first job. Work can have a steep learning curve up front, but gets easier as you get more familiar. Management is nice, but will keep you busy if you seem too idle. Workplace is comprised mostly of 18-25 y/o's, and there's very little/no drama or bad blood between coworkers. Work pace varies on the popularity of the movies being played (i.e Avengers: Endgame had about 4k+ customers over the opening weekend, but something like Super Troopers 2 will have a 600+ opening weekend at best). Overall good place to work, and probably the best first job you could have."
good,"Like any theatre, it’s a great starter job. I met a lot of cool people there, some of which I’m still friends with now, 4 years later. However, if you’ve already gotten into a career field or are getting paid more than minimum wage, it’s not worth it. Also, most people working here are young kids, either in high school or just out of high school. Be prepared for immaturity."
good,"Everything comes down to your position. The moment you're concessions, everything is constant pressure. And the next would be kitchen and cleaning theaters. Everything has to be on time and done. "
good,Working late nights at Regal can be strenuous for some people. This is especially so when big budget movies are premiering. If you make friends with your coworkers it's honestly pretty easygoing.
good,Regal was a very fun and great first job . It’s very easy to learn all the techniques to get you through each day. Everyone there is friendly which leaves good vibes each day . The pay was just to low to maintain a steady income so that’s why I’m looking for jobs elsewhere.
good,"this job keep me busy all day makes the day go by fast"
good,Regal is a pretty relaxed and easy job. You meat all kinds of people there. They help out different charity events yearly. If you love movies you get free movies and food discounts. Managers are pretty cool and relaxed.
good,"Regal was very fun to work, especially concessions. You get to meet a lot of people and the job is fun and not hard. Most of the managers were really nice and would work with you when you needed help."
good,"did maintenance work for several months, got paid the same as a person who sells pop corn but did way more work. Asked for compensation for damaged uniform due to work and for maybe a relook to the pay and was not listened to"
good,"basically since i was the youngest one there it was pretty laid back with around 20 hours a week and for a 16-17 year old its pretty good."
good,"Because this was my first job, I had a blast working here. The movie theater is a great place for any high school or college kid looking for their first, second, or even third job. It was a friendly environment that was easy to handle for a newcomer like me."
good,A typical day at work was crazy it was super busy but i loved that. i loved the rush of it. i dont like not doing anything. i was a clean freak. i learned how to interact with the customers. eveyone loved me if i do say so myself. the hardest part was getting everyone to listen to the rules. but i loved everyone there and my managers.
good,"The job is somewhat easy, but can get demanding. What is frustrating is the CEO's and higher ups in the company do not know much about the day to day of the jobs and they make changes that benefits no one and only makes the place of work to look better but not function better for guests or workers. The management in the work place is actually for the most part fair and understanding."
good,At the regal we had very poor and lack of communication and on top of that we didn’t get paid as much as we should when it was busy but he managements wasn’t doing there job.
good,Overall great place to work the environment is good and the management there is respectable and good. I learned a lot of what I didn't know how a Movie theater functions and a lot what the managers do from day to day.
good,"Very fun work environment, very busy especially on weekends. Fun benefits free movies. Management was very flexible with hours. Great group of staff.."
good,"great place to work, customers are not always nice but employees have fun, management is great and chill, will work around your availablitliy. the hardest part of the job is keeping your cool when a customer blows up in your face. but the most enjoyable part can be the customers too."
good,"I loved working for Regal. "
good,The people that you work with make any job. It so happens that the people that i worked with were pretty friendly and they made my experience working at the movie theater pretty fun.
good,The job is mostly enjoyable although the pay is not the best.  It provides you a great opportunity to work on your customer service skills and problem resolution skills.
good,Very low pay for all the things you have to do. In order to work there you have to be able to multitask and deal with very rude customers      but u do get free movies
good,"Applying for this job was easy. The management is layed back and friendly. The tasked that I performed were easy and required little effort. Full time positions were only limited to employees that have been with the company for a while or elderly employees. Working with regal is a great starting job to gain experience, but has very little opportunities for making it up the company."
good,Great place to work. Fun environment  to be in. It is a little under staffed but when we have the proper staff it’s great. Super easy and fast to learn
good,i liked working at regal because it was very relaxed. there were days when it would be very fast paced but thats with any job sometimes it mat be slow sometimes it may be fast.
good,"Being an Associate manager at Regal would be a great place to learn a multitude of skills if corporate would only allow buildings to have more training hours for their management teams. Because of this, and the non-competition pay, its easy to see some regal buildings go through two - three new associate managers a year. While this may not seem like a lot, when you have a team of 5-6 associates managers, the constant changes can be very stressful. "
good,Great job for when you are in school and need a flexible work schedule. Environment is great and can be both fast and slow paced. Requires a lot of cleaning and customer service.
good,Regal Entertainment Group is a very fast paced and time-sensitive but fun place to work. It is a team-oriented environment but individual initiative is recognized and encouraged. Customer service is of utmost importance and of course compliance to company policy is strictly regulated.
good,"A typical day at Regal Cinemas would be fairly busy, dealing with around 500 customers average on a week day, and roughly 1200-2200 customers average on a weekend. There wasn't too much room for advancement unless a management  position opened up, which is rare. Very positive and helpful staff. Hardest part was keeping up with the rushes and making sure that everything was executed in a timely and proficient manner."
good,"As an Usher you will have to deal with a lot of people, your cleaning, and giving directions. The best part of the job besides the benefits are the workers there. Expect to work on the holidays and to get long hours on school breaks."
good,"The management is willing to listen to any issues you may be having, but because it is a theater you are going to be working until midnight most of the time. Free movies for you and a single guest is nice though."
good,"It was a good place to work, even thugh at times one manager was overbearing."
good,"Overall, Regal Cinemas is a great place to work if you are in college or in-between jobs. There are advancement opportunities available, if you are looking for something after college as well. Regal Cinemas has taught me how to manage and I wouldn't trade that knowledge for anything, but the hardest part of the job is the low wages. I am at the point in my life that I need to start thinking about my future, and unfortunately, I do not see where Regal would fit in realistically."
good,"It's a nice job to have as a first job, but in my opinion not really good long term (unless you're a manager). Management is pretty good, they like when you ask questions and they're there for you whenever you need it. It is definitely very fast paced and often kind of stressful, but sometimes it's pretty relaxing and fun! Just depending on the day and what movies are out"
good,The job is great but its only a high school job but the pay is super low. Also the job is relaxed and you get discounts. So yeah the job is an okay okay.
good,"This job is great if your starting out. It helps you learn the rules of customer service but, leads to little to no advancement in the company itself."
good,"It was my first job so I dont have much to compare it to. The managers were amazing and I loved the employees like they were my family. The only bad thing was we didnt get paid enough for how much stuff we had to put up with, with the customers."
good,the staff is friendly and job is not hard but the managers often dont like to work around your schedule. they want you to be available every weekend even if you work more than one job.
good,"This was a great job for school due to the flexibility with hours. I found the work to be somewhat tedious, but overall, not bad. The discounts on movie tickets were great."
good,"This place is an excellent part-time job during the summer or winter seasons, as the hours are near full-time, sometimes even overtime if you pick up another person's shift. Sure the pay is terrible, and advancement takes years (with full-time availability), which even then only gets you a 50 cent raise. But if you're just starting out, this is a great job to have. But whatever you do, don't work here during the spring, you may only get one 6 hour shift per week if you do."
good,"A typical day depends on what day it is because Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays are more busier and fast paced than the other days. They cross train you so that you are well rounded and can work any position. There are a lot of managers so it can get confusing on who to listen to. The workplace culture is very customer oriented and making sure that they are leaving pleased with the service. The hardest part of the job is handling the customers that feel over entitled and exaggerate situations. The most enjoyable part is getting to know your coworkers and having fun while working."
good,"Had so much fun working there. Great for a first job. Easy to move up if the will is there. When all the movies were playing, youre able to get a rest to breathe."
good,"Typically morning shifts are very slow, even when good movies are out but when a movie like Jurassic World comes out, or Star Wars, the entire theater becomes a mess and everyone has to speed up. This is good and bad, mostly bad, because good in the sense that time isn't an issue, you never feel bored or too relaxed but bad because the quick pace can be sometimes overwhelming to newer members and even older members."
good,This was an easy job.  You could get a lot done and have the chance to get a lot of good leadership experience as a manager and good responsibility for the future.
good,"Most of the day was dealing with customers and that's the hard part. The fun is everything else. It do get busy in the winter time and sometimes you are the only worker in the ticket box. a typical work day is cleaning (a lot) and always helping a customer out no matter what. I learned that people have little patience when it comes to long lines and getting food. Also how to keep my cool in irritating circumstances. The work place is one big team, one big family we have to work together to get every job done. The people you meet is the best part of the job and putting a smile on a persons face."
good,I love my job and the fact I get to interact with customers. It also keeps you up and moving and the job is generally good exercise. My only complaints for the job are that we don't get paid enough for the amount of stress that is dealt with on a day to day basis. It's a $10.50 an hour job but really should be $12 an hour
good,Great company to work for and get real life customer experience while in high school. Not a great job when you need benefits and vacation time. Pay is not as great for the older adult either.
good,Good place for a first job. Teaches you a basic understanding of what to look for in future jobs. Free movies came along with the job and your coworkers were often friendly
good,"I first started as a concession worker selling snacks and drinks to customers to enjoy during the movie they were seeing. Towards they end of my time there, they started putting me in the box office to sell tickets to customers and answering the phone when needed. I ran a register taking both cash and card. The only time the register was off was when a customer would take a candy from my racks and pay for it at another register, the candy was on racks outside the concession stand. Though there was advancement possible, it didn't happen very often. Enjoyable was knowing what movies were out and able to see them for free with a friend whenever I wanted. Hardest was when a customer would ask whether the movie they were seeing was good or bad and I couldn't answer from having not seeing it yet."
good,"Not the best in pay and even with immediate benefits its still not the best. I would like to say the free movies and free popcorn off sets this however, the pay was minimum wage when i worked for them"
good,"I've learned things about films and ad prom. I was assigned in the marketing department and it was amazing. I was exposed in the film industry, especially in the post-production."
good,"-Interact with many customers"
good,A typical day of work involves me clocking in and immediately heading to work making sure that the money from the previous night was counted correctly and that everything is even. Once this is done I make the tills for all the registers that will be needed for the day as well as make sure all the projectors are on. The next thing I will need to do is go over the floor staffs work making sure that Box office as well as concession has been opened correctly so that we can do business efficiently. Once the doors are open and people are coming in I will handle the closing out of employees as needed and any customer service issues that may arise.
good,"a typical day at work would be opening the theater. I would set up all popcorn popper pieces, assemble all the ovens and fryers. After, I'm done setting up the concession stand I would make sure all the light and exit light in all the auditoriums and lobby are all lit and working properly. The management at regal are very professional with great work ethic."
good,"Great place to work. Can be busy and stressful, at times. "
good,"The job was not too demanding, physically, mentally, or in a timely manner. Managers were almost always very flexible with my schedule. Not too difficult to move up in the company if you truly wish to."
good,"Work during the week is typically very slow, not many people come to the movie theater during weekdays. Unfortunately, that usually means that people will get sent home and not get many work hours. However, weekends are usually extremely busy and best time to get all your hours."
good,"A typical day at work involved dealing with tons and tons of people for hours on end. Some of them were nice and polite, others were very rude and entitled. What made working here more bearable was my co-workers. We would always joke around and have fun when we could. The hardest part of this job was holding your tongue when someone decided they were going to talk to you like you were stupid. The most enjoyable part was, again, working with my co-workers."
good,"Great place to work, lots of fun.  There is always something that needs to be done, time does not drag on.  Previewing movies before they are released is fun!  Crowd control on highly anticipated movies is a pain.  Management and staff are fun."
good,Easy to come to  work when its a fun and Fast paced work environment. Not to mention the free movie passes. Can get very busy on weekends and holidays
good,"Typical day of work was busy with me being a customer service manager. I learned that corporate will not have your back. One coworker claimed i made fun of her because of her S.O. even though it wasn't true, and they fired me without asking my say. The associates knew there job and they did it. Other managers did not they'd rather pass the job to someone else rather than do it themselves. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry crowds of people wanting refunds, i would do it but it was very stressful. The enjoyable part of the job was making people happy."
good,My Job is fun and very productive working at the movies has taught me to work welll with others and how to handle situations . My job matured me more than I was before. I started at regal when I was seventeen now that I am older I would like to have a new job to grow and better myself as a person .
good,"was a great and fun place to work. it was lacking in management but other than that it was a good place to work. on a happy note, you also got to see free movies."
good,"I worked in the same place  for a few summers so I've express my review already and there is nothing else I can say.   It was  very fun place to work.  "
good,"I have worked for Regal for 11 years and love it. The benefits of free movies is the main reason why anyone would want to work there. Although the payscale is low, the people you work with are nice."
good,"Smaller operation.  Good employees, long term knowledge.  Local feel, Family owned.  Limited resources, but good quality and execution.  Very client focussed, but managed to give employees work life balance."
good,"Ensured theaters were clean before and after movies throwing away trash, sweeping, and checking seats. Took tickets at the door, sold popcorn, sodas, candies and snacks"
good,"Working for regal is pretty fun, but it can be challenging. A typical day there includes serving people, handling cash, and cleaning. Working there, I've learned how to handle difficult people as well as the millions of different personalities people can have. My managers are great, the employees are fun, and they have flexible scheduling. What I love most about the job is being able to satisfy customers and being able to pass along my knowledge about movies. The worst part of the job is the rushes we have when new movies come out."
good,The movie theater was perfect for my first real job while I was in high school. I got the opportunity to be a projectionist before all the theaters turned digital and that was an awesome experience.
good,"at the beginning it is a fun job, you get free movies its a flexible work schedule. not many chances for you to move up in the company and pay isn't nearly worth it once you start getting those picky customers  .management is pretty good for the most part only annoying thing is that if you will tell a customer no outside drinks a manager will apologize and let them in half the time making you look bad."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Regal. Always fair treatment, good incentives, cool people."
good,Worked here for 13 years and mostly enjoyed it.  Can be long hours sometimes but overall a good place to work.  If you work hard and are dependable you can advance if that's what you want.
good,"coworkers are the best"
good,"It is one of those jobs you will always miss after moving on."
good,"This is a great first part time position and very good at getting both retail experience and human resources skills. They like to promote within if you wish to apply for management or supervisor, and the work force is very close. Flexible scheduling works around almost any schedule."
good,I would show up at the theater and get my stuff set up for the day.    Then I would always try to clock in on-time or early if I could.    When I had time (while not taking tickets or checking with the ushers to know when theaters were ready to be seated in) I would spend the day greeting and talking to customers while they waited for their theater to be ready to be seated in.
good,"This Cinema is a fairly large one in my opinion. With 16 theatres, there is no short amount of work to do. The culture consists of many high school student, college students and few others. As with any environment as such, it wasn't without drama. Especially since we would have half a dozen managers all working at a time, mixed and poor communication during a ""busy"" time was a constant issue."
good,"What can I say? It's just a typical movie theater. Fun, though."
good,"This job was mainly cleaning. Wiping down concessions, sweeping, cleaning the popcorn machine, cleaning theaters, etc. But it also involved customer service as well. In the theater business they will teach you how to greet people and be friendly to make people want to return. They were on top of their breaks for the most part but needed to be reminded every once in awhile. I very much enjoyed the managers and people I worked with. It was a young atomsphere which helped with how fun it was but work was also expected of you."
good,A typical day of work depending if I was an usher or cashier that day would either be spent cleaning theaters or selling popcorn.  The management was very organized and my co-workers were friendly.  The hardest part of the job I would say was telling people they couldn't bring outside food in.  The most enjoyable part was making the popcorn.
good,I would clean up the movie theatres after the film was done and everyone had left. I also would work in the ticket booth and tell the customers where their theatre number is. I would also welcome anyone who would come to the theatre very politely and professionally.
good,"A typical day at work involves me and another manager in charge of two or three floorstaff. We dedicate our day to providing prestine customer service to patrons that attend our movies. A lot of behind the sceens work involves upkeep of the theater that we work at, paperwork for daily reports, scheduling management and reporting to contractors and vendors when they are needed for issues in the theater. Management is a job that takes on a lot of responsibility for writing reports and formal emails, being in charge of the floorstaff and making sure they are doing their duties, counting and compiling inventory reports, detail scheduling for all employees, communication to vendors and contractors for maintenance,  and scheduling movies. Customer service is #1 in this field and what my job is revolved around. All the work we do is to assure the customer is getting a regal premium experience every visit."
good,working here  was a great oppurtunity to start job experiance it is a good work enviorment i just needed more hours. Its has great managers and is a well enviorment to work sometimes it gets rush hour but overall it is a great place to work.
good,"I had a blast working for the company. Overall, employees are treated well and the company rewards hard workers. The pay is not so great, but there's potential to grow within the company."
good,The time at Regal was great. Management was very understanding and helpful when things came up. They did their best to train everyone and treat them with courtesy and respect. There was always work to be done and with movie showings every hour the time flew by. The most enjoyable part of my Projection Management experience was editing film reels and being able to watch the finished product by myself with no other distractions in the theater.
good,"Opening the movie theatre, making popcorn, putting registers together, inventory control, payroll; greeting and post greeting patrons.  I learned to help others when requested, to train employees on proper operations of concession and to take pride in your work and yourself because life is an adventure. Management was helpful and knowledgeable.  My co-workers were friendly, helpful and eager to learn. The hardest part of my job was the schedule, with the late night shifts then coming in the next morning. The most enjoyable part of my job was to meet new people through their interest of different movies."
good,"This was my favorite job! I love movies, they are my passion. I recommend it to teenagers."
good,"The weekdays were fairly slow with the exception of a few hours when it would pick up a little. Weekends could get pretty hectic, but were not altogether unpleasant. Management was quite helpful and relaxed as long as you completed your duties. Co-workers were generally not bad to work with. Most of them were helpful and helped make the job fun. The hardest part was closing concession, the best part was closing usher."
good,Loved working here! The only downside when I was there was the pay.
good,"I loved working at Regal Cinemas. The managers were great, friendly and approachable and the hourly wage was enough to take care of all aspects in my life at the time."
good,"when you come in everyone is generally polite and greets you. there really wasn't a hardest part, it was all pretty simple. the most enjoyable part of working at regal cinemas was hearing what the customers liked and didn't like about the movies."
good,"Great group of people, Loved working here, sadly there is not a lot of room for advancement.Loved the fast paced weekends, and the regulars. Hardest part would be the messes but it was still fun"
good,"I learned alot from this company on how to deal with customers, and how to use a cash register. the co- workers were fun people to work with."
good,Working for Regal Cinema is a great first or second job to have. They hire from within however advancements don't come up too often. You really have to like movies and customer service to work at any theater.
good,It was a fun place to work in High School. People were goofy and fun to hang around and the job was easy and straightforward. Good place to earn some extra cash in HS.
good,"Your typical day as a manager consists of running the floor and making sure all basic customer related positions are running smoothly. you are also responsible for money handling, employee scheduling, customer complaints and basically any other issue tha'ts going to come up for the day."
good,"I've worked at Regal for over a year now. I really enjoy it. A lot has changed in the company since I started working but I still enjoy it. They're incredibly flexible with scheduling and school leave. I missed it when I was away at school. It has its ups and downs, like any job, but at the end of the day I really enjoy it because of my co-workers. You're working with other high school/college kids and most of the managers are pretty young, too. We're all kinda crazy and weird and we just have a lot of fun. It can get kind of fast and stressful during busy weekends/rushes so you need to be quick but efficient when you're behind concessions or be ready to clean up after customers if you're ushering. The hardest part of the job is honestly dealing with the customers. You'll be amazed the amount of trash they leave behind when you literally pass like five trash cans on your way out. That bothers me so much. You deal with some crazy customers, one made me cry, but it'll give you some funny stories to tell. Overall, if you're looking for a way to make some money while you're in school, this is the place. Plus you get to see free movies and get half off concessions :)"
good,"Helping customers through all aspects of the movie going experience from selling them tickets when they walk in the door to cleaning up the theaters after them once they left, and all the concessions in the middle!"
good,Managers are nice. Pay is good. Benefits are okay. I found it very easy to make friends with both the managers and lower workers. The hours are very good.
good,I was an assistant manager but I was not going to go any further. When you are a very likable manager and use kindness and you have a policy of being fair but firm it sometimes does not vibe with other personalities. Never sacrifice your integrity and always treat your employees with respect.
good,"The job was just what I wanted. The culture of it was my bread and butter. I got to meet great people through the company and also got to know loyal costumers while all talking about movies. I got to move up from the floor staff, to eventually managing the floor staff. The work/life wasn't always balanced, and the pay wasn't good for a long time but overall I enjoyed my experience. The hardest part of the job for me was probably managing the building with low staff and having large rushes of costumers. My favorite part was the ability to talk movies with anyone, staff or costumers, and talking to the costumers was what I always enjoyed the most."
good,Super fun place to work! It was super chill and flexible considering I go to school full-time. Only problem is the corporate office is not organized which affects all the theaters.
good,It was a wonderful experience working at Regal. I met so many new people that I still talk to even after leaving. I just wish the managers could carry tasks out more sufficiently.
good,"Regal will always hold a special place in my heart. While working there you feel like a part of the Regal family. However, corporate likes to make senseless rules for its employees to follow which makes working difficult at times."
good,"I have to say there are times where I felt stressed, but all in all its a great enviroment. Everyone is really friendly and you can be yourself without fear of judgment."
good,"Regal is one of the best companies to work for, the day to day interactions are always different and it feels like a new job everyday depending on what job you are scheduled for. The benefits of half off concessions and free movies with a friend are a big sell point as well."
good,"• Concessions - taking people's orders and serving them"
good,"I got this job because I had a love for movies. For me I got to see a free movie every day, whatever the screen type may be, and half off 16 items if you worked (8 if you didnt). The crew had its ups and downs. The busy days I had my most fun, because I myself love stress and a fast paced job."
good,It was a fun place to work with nice co workers. It's easy to ask for time off but the hours were inconsistent and random. Shifts are cut often and hours can run until midnight or later if closing. But over all it's an easy fun job with benefits such as free movies and half off concessions.
good,"A day in Regal. In my particular location work is both fast paced and slow paced depending on what's going on. When customers are present the work goes by pretty fast while I take orders, restock, and make the food. When there are no customers the work is super slow because we restock and then clean, which isn't bad until you start running out of places to clean. What I enjoy about my job is helping the customers and cleaning, and the benefits of free movies and discounted concessions are a bonus. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers and working concessions by myself especially on a Tuesday when we have a discount on popcorn for Regal Crown Club Holders. The problem is that if there are too many customers there can be a huge line and I'm the only one on. Despite that most days are just fine with the worst problem being boredom."
good,As a first job I had a good experience I would go back it can be hectic at time but generally you work with a team where everyone does there job to work effectively
good,Regal Entertainment was a positive experience for my working  career. It was a job opportunity that I wouldn't change. The management and helpfulness was exceptional and the employees were all friendly. It definitely improved me as a person and will benefit me in the long run.
good,"Regal Cinemas seems to have a pretty hands off approach when it comes to it's management, and that may damage it's customer service depending on the specific theater, but for a worker the treatment is quite fair. The benefits and perks are generous and the work is what you'd expect out of a minimum wage job. Being an usher can be physically demanding for those not in the best of shape and working box office or concessions can be stressful on busy days. However, nothing about the job is inherently difficult, everything is very simple to understand. Also considering all the showtimes line up there are multiple periods during screenings to recharge and organize yourself and your area."
good,"Scheduling most days, Management of staff cut or added daily according to Customer/staff hours. Recruiting and training always goes well, seeing new High Schools Students anticipating their first job. "
good,"overall okay company to work for, employees enjoy engaging with customers and being able to help. Pay doesn't make up for the amount of work that is required. but overall its a great first time job for a teenager. great advancement opportunities  as well."
good,"I've been at Regal for about a month now, and so far it is one of the best jobs I've had. Management is somewhat laid back and very understanding of certain conditions (like if you're running late, for example.) The pay isn't really the best, the hours will always be less than 40 (even for managers most of the time,) closing for concessions can take a really long while, especially if you have no one there to help you, and the pay is biweekly. "
good,It's a great place to start out for a job. Would not be a permanent job for anyone above twenty-one. I learned how to work in a fast pace environment. How to deal with customers and having there needs to meet.
good,Regal provides a great working environment for every employee and allows for multiple opportunities to advance within the company. Regal is constantly looking for ways to make improvements for guests and employee relations.
good,"At Regal Entertainment Group, I learned how to properly manage time, as well as my employees. The best part of the job is the people. Some of the nicest folks you'll ever meet."
good,"A good place to start for your first job. Slow enough where you can trained properly, and busy enough to put your training to the test. Business is very polarizing though. You're either slow to the point where you've done the chore list twice over, or it's busy to point where you don't even realize you've worked for 8 hours. The staff are great. Friendly, and funny, and management is solid. There's some issue here and there, but all businesses have there up's and downs."
good,"During the weekdays or weekend mornings, it it not too bad, but during popular movies on weekend nights it can be hectic. Often you get long shifts with only one break."
good,"This job was a great start for me being able to teach and provide great experience. They were unable to work well with my schedule but tried their best. A job that gives you a needed challenge and teaches you how to problem solve, manage your time, work with problems under stress and much more."
good,"Our Regal was special being it was in one of the biggest, busiest malls in TN, Opery Mills Mall. Honestly we could have use more staff at the location though we did get an extra dollar more than other locations. The theater was always a special place for me so I enjoyed my job. I enjoyed the stressful opening nights and the dead weekdays nothing good was playing. Hours can stretch out standing and waiting for tickets, and customers can be very difficult here. As an usher you will be making sure nobody brings in food and drinks from the mall. Also that nobody brings in any weapons or alcohol."
good,"Regal movie cinemas is a very friendly environment in terms of the staff members. Customers on the other hand, can be stressful. I recommend anyone to apply because its a simple job that opens you up to customer service and gives you the social skill to handle customer concerns and complaints."
good,For a first job it wasn’t too bad. You get a few pretty good perks but there really wasn’t much advancement or benefits. If you are looking for something simple then this is the job for you.
good,"It's exactly what you'd expect for working at a movie theater. I thought it was really fun and a great learning experience. It was my first job, and a great one at that. I learned various things such as time management, how to work under pressure and as a team player."
good,"The people at this job were like family. Everyone, including managers got along. Everyone worked together to fix problems and solve this issues. I learned a lot about communication and working together to get the job done quickly with satisfied customers and employees."
good,This job was great. it was fast paced at times and slow other times. It all depended on which movies we were showing at the time. Most enjoyable part was free movies and discounts whenever
good,"Well, the Regal environment is great and surely fun, is a great choice to work and To be frankly you get experience, knowledge, and friends at this job. The requirements and responsibilities are kind of high but nothing crazy. I'd recommend Regal as a nice and joy place to work."
good,"This is a great first job it’s fun, you get half off food and free movie tickets. However they don’t pay well, it is not a livable income so don’t plan on staying after you graduate unless you want to become a manager."
good,For those looking for a job in high school I'd recommend this one. It is an easy job that provides a stable income for high school students. Not only that but it is a place where you can gain experience for working as a adult.
good,"It's a fun first job, pretty much any regal you go to your welcome with a fun accepting coworkers. It's just when you work there for a while you start to notice the flaws and backward things that happen."
good,"Great atmosphere, my only con is that is doesn’t have the best pay or advancement. If you are looking for a career job it will be difficult but if you’re a high school kid then it’s a great job"
good,It was a good work environment. Management was honest and straight forward. Fast pace at times but never felt like you were alone during them. Slow times never felt slow because there was always things to be done.
good,a typical day working at regal is you start out working at the concession stand handling the food and money. i learned how to work an cash register...
good,there is no typical day at work... the hardest part of the job is dealing with what you going to walk into from day to day....     lots of favoritism....
good,Regal Entertainment Group is a great place to work when going to college. They have flexible hours and the job is enjoyable. I would recommend working here.
good,I learned how it worked behind the counter and big projector. Really an experience and quite fun with some nice friendly managers and co workers. Would recommend for a first time job.
good,"The jobs involve ushering (cleaning the theaters and directing people to their theaters), and concessions (selling food to customers). Neither job is difficult, but they can both be very fast paced when the theater is busy. Hours are not fixed, and the employee is likely to be sent home early if the day is slow. The managers are understanding and relaxed for the most part, and the employees are very friendly."
good,"While not the greatest amount of respect or pay, it's a stable first-time job and has nice benefits to working there. Difficult to handle the job on busier days, but the coworkers were very kind and the management was tough but fair. Very fun workplace if you allow it to be."
good,"As far as basic wage jobs go, Regal Cinemas is ideal. Because of the way movies are organized there are frequent stretches between blocs of customers that allow cleaning and restocking work to get done at a steady pace, rather than a constant flood. Management is relaxed and easy to approach. People going to movies tend to be happy, which makes customer interaction a breeze. And the benefits of being able to see free movies on the big screen whenever you like, as well as bring a friend, cannot be understated."
good,"A typical day was a good day, uplifting customers. I learned how to work at very fast pace because we all know how packed movies can be. Management was always helpful and kind. Hardest part of the job was cleaning the pop corn machine!!! overall I loved it, free movies!"
good,"Overall, Regal is a fun place to work for. It practices a balance of time management and efficiency. Ultimately, I had a good experience working with people that made it feel like a team and managers who would be willing to help on crazy, busy nights."
good,"It's customer service at a movie theater, so it's pretty much exactly what it sounds like. Working with the public can be frustrating, but management always has your back. Perks include unlimited soft drinks and popcorn, plus free movies!"
good,"This was my first job. I worked hard and made sure to follow the rules. Within a year, I was promoted to what would be the equivalent of lead floor staff. Another year after that, I was promoted to associate manager. There wasn't much room for advancement because all of the positions were filled, and I did not make enough money to relocate for a higher position."
good,"I worked at a particular Regal Theatre that was very small and relatively slow. The building itself was in poor condition and the work-environment was relaxed."
good,"I enjoyed working at the movie theatre. It was a fun job but the management was not all so good. While working at a movie theatre you have to be very fast, very patient, & have good people skills."
good,"It’s a great place to work at, they are professional, they are nice people, the employees are just GREAT PEOPLE! They give you free movie tickets and 50% off food if you work there"
good,"In the morning I would work alone at the concessions stand, and sometimes I would in box office. The costumers in the morning consisted of senior citizens and sometimes families. The mood was laid back, no problems came up while I worked. The hardest part about the job was that I couldn't be myself, I need to suppress some natural emotions, that helped me interact with others, so that I was presentable to the customers at the box office and in concessions."
good,Great place to meet new people with different views. Workdays can be pretty busy depending on the location that you work. 401k for anyone older than 21 years even if they work PT.
good,"Good part-time job for anyone trying to work a little. "
good,Great place to work but will say that the managerment is kinda or was kinda laidback and was hands off a little too much in the past and the floor staff can and will get away with more then they should which hurts current day operation sometimes as you have to double check and ensure job was completed correctly and timely
good,This was one of my jobs in high school that I briefly carried on with during the summers of college. I worked there for a few years and it had its general workplace ups and downs. The upper management was not very good in my opinion.
good,i would wake up go there and not have any issues at all. it was a fun healthy environment. evn though i wasnt there that long it was still fun to work there.
good,"Fun environment, easy training. Advancement is really dependant on location. Base level employees make minimum wage, however managers are not fairly compensated for the amount of work required."
good,It's a good job if you've never had one and the management is really good and really flexible scheduling overall it's pretty layed back .the only doen side is that not many people want to cover shifts.
good,"I worked at regal cinemas for quite a while, taking my time, and making sure i did things right. This job was great, working with big projectors and people all day was fun! The feel to the atmosphere was amazing."
good,"Work experience: janitorial duties, food handling, alcohol serving, cash register, and customer service. Opportunities to move up in movie business..."
good,The job is not for everyone but those who stay become friends for life. Through working with regal entertainment group I have learned many management and leadership skills that will lead me into bigger and better things.
good,"Working at regal entertainment group has taught me the true meaning of customer service. Being an employee of one of the largest movie theater chains in the country, I have learned that customer service is the act of wanting to help others achieve as much happiness as possible in the time they are at a regal movie theater. Guests come to the movie theater to have an enjoyable movie experience and it is our responsibility as regal employees to make that happen. Regal is a fun place to work and even though sometimes working busy nights can be stressful and exhausting, working alongside my coworkers makes up for the cons."
good,"its an okay job. The hours are good. Some of the managers are not as nice as others. Really busy on holidays, so don't plan on doing anything but working, especially on Christmas."
good,"You are responsible for satisfying the customer. You make sure there is popcorn in the warmer and that everything is stocked for when a rush is going to start. When everyone works together and as a team, it makes the shift go smoother. There will be customers that make you want to quit your job right then and there, but you have to remember that the customer will be gone soon and you won't have to deal with them again. If you enjoy working around children, working the kid's shows is the shift for you. The excitement the kids have on their face when they get to go see their favorite movie, is a look you will never forget. There are times where you will work in a fast-paced environment, but then there are times when it is slow and you don't know what to do with your shift. The managers help you during the rushes to make it run smoother. They are there to teach us and to help us in our time of need. They are laid-back, but know when to be serious with us."
good,"This job was about what you'd expect from a typical movie theater job. I almost exclusively worked the box office. Some days would be longer than others when very few people would come to the theater but there were still thngs to do throughout the day. Management was polite as long as you were doing your job. The people who I worked with in the box office were friendly and we'd help the day go by faster for each other. Breaks were fairly leniant and you could take your one break at any time during your shift. As far as benefits, it's hard to beat free movies in the summer."
good,"Regal Entertainment Group was a fun place to work, no two days were alike."
good,I have been with Regal for nine years and have enjoyed it. The managers and district manager that I have interacted with have helped me tremendously in my improvement of work skills and my management style to become a better business person.
good,"I love Regal ent! Taught me so much  learning on projections how a theatre fully operates, it is very fast paced and sometimes can be over whelming because movie theatres do a lot of business especially during holidays or summer vacation the business usually perks up big time meaning longer nights and busier shifts"
good,"Movie theatres are great, especially Regal Cinemas. Free movies, free popcorn and drinks on the clock, and all of the great customers coming in and making you laugh."
good,"If you love video games, of course this place is the best. Flexible hours and tons of people interaction. Great employee discount and overall fun experience"
good,"Regal is a great first job to have. Mostly college students work here with a few high school students. A typical day is clocking in and heading straight to concessions. ( Concessions is where new employees begin and later advance to ticket collection or box office) Shifts are usually around 6 to 7 hours and you are pretty much in the same place the entire shift. The hardest part of the job is the movie theatres get CROWDED, but with team work the job is not impossible. The best part is that you get free movie tickets whenever and half off of concession food."
good,"Great part time job, especially if you like movies.  Doesn't pay well but the free movies are well worth it.  Have to work a lot of nights, weekends and holidays."
good,Worked at a special regal that had a full kitchen. Never a dull moment and lots of fun in the back of the house. Lots of drama in the ffront of the house that was easy to avoid. Constantly staying productive and helping others is what was expected. Keeping a clean work space was very important here.
good,"A typical day at work would be handling tickets for customers and serving concession items for customers before, during and even after movie. I learned how to manage money, manage draws, handle food content such as popcorn and nachos, learned how to shut down/start up machinery. Management was efficient, co-workers had a tight bond and were efficient. The hardest part of the job was summer movies for a $1 with the day-cares. The most enjoyable part of working there was being able to discuss common popular movies with eager customers."
good,Unique and flexible workplace. They look out for one another. The staff and guests' safety was always the number one priority.
good,"It's a very relaxed choice of work. Advancement is not likely, but the atmosphere is fun and the hours are plentiful."
good,"Management is fun to work with, but sometimes unable to draw boundaries. Favoritism from management was big. Co-workers were awesome to work with."
good,I would always try to come in on time with a clear head. The management was strict but not unbalanced. The people i worked with  were some of the nicest people i have known. The best part of this job is the freedom to do different things.
good,"I met a lot of my friends through Regal, the workplace is just like going to the movie to hangout with your buddies except you get paid to do it. The duties are pretty simple and easy to pick up after several shifts. The typical work day is repetitive, but with the different people that come in and out of the theater- it's interesting every day!"
good,"Its very hands on, every day is different, and you work in a movie theater - how awesome is that? The easiest part of the job is interacting with our guests that come to see a movie, they are always so excited to see us that you can't help but get excited along with them. The hardest part of the job...that would have to be the hours, which are very flexible but they don't always get you the hours you need a week, sometimes for several weeks."
good,"Good people, good experience, free movies, good hours and pay for a short term job. Management is very friendly and approachable."
good,"Pretty easy job"
good,"Great 1st job for a lot of people, I worked their for 2 years and generally enjoyed my job. While it did suck sometimes because of the customers and having to work every holiday without fail, the mangers and fellow employees made this a bearable burden to deal with. It really did feel like a family when i worked their, I could tell that my managers really did care about my well being. I made friends that I still have to this day working at this place"
good,"The other employees are very friendly and helpful, but the customers are almost always rude. I was literally slapped by one of the customers because she refused to pay the cost for extra butter. So as long as you have a tough exterior, I recommend this job for you."
good,"A typical day at work was cleaning bathrooms, cleaning up after a movie was over, & taking tickets at the door."
good,"The co-workers and managers are very nice people and great to work with. "
good,"Coworkers are really friendly and enjoyable to work with. I have had issues with people not following rules, being lazy, or being flaky. We have to over-hire most of the time because people are only available one or two days out of the week. We also have people who give away a lot of their shifts or call in sick a lot. "
good,Everything revolves around opening weekends and popcorn. It can be fluffy and fantastic or chaos and a zoo.
good,Great atmosphere if you love the entertainment industry. Fun environment and great employees. Was demanding on weekends and holidays. Everyone worked holidays and every weekend. No exceptions.
good,"You have a lot of duties that keep it mixed up, none of which are difficult. Management varies but isn't typically too strict or hard to deal with. If you do your job right you'll get along fine. You get free movies! If you're going to work for minimum wage, this is a good place."
good,"I usually work in the box office where the movie tickets are sold. Each shift consists of 2 or 3 'rounds' with either a half hour or hour break in between each round. I learned a lot about customer service while working for this company. Management is flexible and enjoyable, and also effective and efficient. My co-workers are kind and enjoyable to work with, and they are great at working together to get the job done. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers, and customers who complain about the prices. The most enjoyable part of the job is the free movies, and my co-workers."
good,I worked here while going to school and they work with your schedule and have later shifts for people who go to school during the day
good,"a typical day at work can be easy going or very busy depending on the season and what position you work in the day.  I learned a lot about customer service, money handling, and inventory management.  I also learned that you have to use hospitality skills to keep the customers happy.  Management and my co workers were a pleasure to work with.  Hardest part of the job is when the theater is busy and get down all the lines.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that you can come back not on shift and watch movies for free."
good,"I would manage the concession stand, clean theaters, and sell tickets. I learned amazing communication skills, time management skills, and a great work ethic. Loved the movie theater and the employees. "
good,"Depending on the time of year and shift would come in if opened power on projection, count the safe, set up register banks. Prepare the building for opening by setting up the concession stand, doing daily inspection and printing off any needed paperwork. Through out the shift would ensure building was being run properly and that the employees had what they needed. If closed would do the same during day operations such as helping customers and ensuring building was running properly,doing cash pulls and directing the employees on what was to be done. At closing count down registers, take them upstairs and count all profit for day if for concession, in down stairs office if box office. Combine money for cash drop after checking all was correct, then again count safe to make sure was even and then do closing day procedures. Learned various new ways of doing things within the business, gained knowledge of different computer programs such as excel and Regal's POS systems.Occasionally had to replace registers allowing me to learn how to trouble shoot various computer issues. The management team worked well together , had to adapt to a new general manager and new way of doing things at the beginning of 2012 as we had a new one come in after the previous accepted a job at different theatre within the company. As with the our floor staff I always have a good working relationship with them, they know what to expect with me. They understand that while they can have some fun at work I expect all duties to be done in a timely manner and in the correct way. Hardest part of the job has been"
good,"I've been with this company since I was 16. Sometimes I feel like I actually spend more time here, than at home. I have a wonderful general manager and a really nice management team. I really enjoy the co-workers, and it doesn't hurt that this is a pretty fun place to work! I really have nothing bad to say about the company. "
good,"Preparing for the day's business or the next day's business.  I've learned how to handle customers, employees and co-workers.  Being proactive to handle any potential hazards or business needs.  Hardest part of the job is having to work so late on the weekends, having a family. Most enjoyable part is working with people and a rewarding experience in helping customers correct the worst of problems."
good,"A normal day at work was fun, we were busy most of the time so there was no time for procrastinating. I learned how to be an efficient cashier and how to read a script when there were incoming calls. i had clean up duties when i was on the floor, i also became efficient at logging in information in the computer for customers who wanted to join our reward club. Management was very helpful and always encouraged us to work at high level, most of my co-workers were the same way. The job wasn't hard at all because im very good at multi-tasking, i'm also a fast learner so i adjust very easy. I liked the job mainly because of the environment that i worked in, and the staff that worked around me. those two factors made me comfortable and happy to attend work daily, i only missed two days in the year that i was there."
good,I enjoyed working here. My co-workers and managers were friendly and easy to work with. I learned about customer service and what goes behind the scenes in movie theaters. The hardest part was cleaning up significant messes customers left behind. The best part was working in a friendly environment and the ability to see movies for free.
good,"This job is effortless to pick up on given very few responsibilities to keep track of that mostly revolves around keeping you area clean. The training takes only a few days following, learning, and helping a fellow associate with the position they are teaching you in and over the short time gives you more of the duty in the responsibilities in the position you both are working till you are capable of doing it on your own"
good,The workplace is great if you have a good team to work with. Usually more busy on the weekends.
good,"I loved working with my co-workers and managers. The environment was great, and I especially loved working with the customers. As an employee, we got free tickets to movies and discounts on some foods while at work."
good,"It’s a great place to work, very nice co-workers and managers but once the holiday season ends there’s too many people working so everyone gets less and less shifts a week."
good,I liked working here. They always respected us here. We was able to talk with management when a issue came about normally results in a good response for all.
good,"Not too much turnover during the summer-fall months, but things can get weird during the winter-spring, you are guaranteed a lot of work hours during the holiday season for sure."
good,The job at regal will be mostly not very busy days where there's not a whole lot of stuff to do but it gets ungodly busy during holiday seasons which are not fun to work but definitely not very bad to work
good,"Fun workplace if your coworkers are fun, but can be stressful, especially when big movies come out or holidays. You have to be prepared to deal with dozens to hundreds of people on a daily basis."
good,"There was always something to do when customers were there, but when there wasn't, it got very slow. I would say that that's normal for most work places."
good,This was the second job I obtained while I was in high school. It was a good job at the time and it let me get experience working with others as well as customer service.
good,I learned alot at my time at regal. And I don't regret it at all. My reasons for eventually leaving came down to the demanding late night and early morning hours back to back. Also the customer base was never pleasant
good,"It was a pleasant first job experience. I liked my managers , the pace was fast but manageable , the constant turn over made it to meet a lot of people."
good,"As this was my first job, I learned a lot and I just felt like it was time to move on now that I have more responsibilities and I need more hours, as they weren’t able to give me."
good,"Working at Regal I learned a lot about customer service and how to deal with different types of customers. The most enjoyable part of the job were when customers would thank me for the service I gave them. The management was okay, they did not really care for the employees. Other than that it was a very pleasurable time there and I wouldn't change my experience at all."
good,"Typical day at work consisted being ready for a busy and productive day right from the moment of clocking in. It was always really important to always be doing something productive and not just stand around. I learned a lot all the way from how a popper machine works to how operate a giant trash compactor. I learned much more but it shows how diverse the work can be. In addition to learning many skills with Regal, the management had a big impact on how Regal was ran. The management was fine from what I could see. It was pretty standard you get scheduled for a certain job for the day and most of the time managers dealt with a lot of customer service. Floor staff dealt with it as well, but in the end managers had the ultimate decision on the proper way to help customers. I found the most enjoyable part of the job was working on cleaning theaters being able to stick to a schedule/list and check off cleaning theaters felt good for me. It also provided a decent workout some days I would see I walked 15+ miles and climbed many flights of stairs. All of this just from being on theater checks or cleaning theaters. On the other side of the job, Concessions was more stressful for me even though I thought I did a good job it was important to be fast, have a good memory, find efficient ways to work, and be good with money. Concessions worked much more with the guests as well. The hardest part of the job probably was closing concessions some nights we would have to stay until 2:00AM to properly clean everything. It usually depended on when the latest show was. I am not sure if that still"
good,"You have to love movies but also love interacting with other people who love them too. "
good,It's a great place to work especially of you're a college student! They work well with your school hours and the overall environment is warm and welcoming
good,Working around a college has its benefits because most of the employees were college kids. Youre on your feet for countless hours. pay is horrible. its a starter job and advancement is slow.
good,Very good customer service along with friendly employees. Giving respect will earn you respect back. Always being kind and helpful will get you very far into a good working environment.
good,"It was my first job and I loved it. The only reason I quit was because I wasn't getting paid enough for the amount of work they wanted. They had me cleaning a lot in the mornings before we opened. I didn't mind it, but I just wished I got paid more for it. The general manger was really stingy when it came to raises. The people I worked with were so much fun. That was the main reason I loved working there."
good,"While working there is a struggle due to the hard labor, the management, and other staff made the experience worth it for months I worked there as an usher/concessions stand employee."
good,"A typical day will depend on what movies are out. If there is a big movie such as the Avengers, expect to work nonstop. Otherwise most of the time it can be pretty boring."
good,"Management is very easy going and willing to help you. Plenty of amazing co workers, but when it comes to the select few that are very difficult. They are very difficult. Management does not interfere and stop misbehaving/bullying on a regular basis."
good,"it's a really nice place for a first job and encourages you to do your best."
good,"A typical workday is usually pretty chill. management is very lenient about a lot except for having phones out. The other employees are very friendly. The hardest part of the job is standing the entire time or closing duties; Those being cleaning the popcorn machine and Emptying the Ice Machine. The most enjoyable part was that we got two movie tickets per day, however that recently changed to only two per week."
good,Come in with friendly coworkers and just do your position. The management is really friendly. You get to deal with guests all day that are genuine and nice.
good,"Typical day is basically customer service and helping guest. I learned a lot with managing staff, projector trouble shooting, and building films. Great place to work."
good,"it was okay but it started going downhill, you would honestly be busy for an hour and then busy for 2, and that repeated all through out the  day, so your poison really."
good,"I would recommend Regal to many first-time job seekers, specifically younger prospective workers in high school or college. They are very accommodating to the scheduling needs, short and long term, of all employees. Additionally, the floor staff position entails a variety of duties and demands skills that are applicable to many work environments, including customer interaction skills, collaborative organization, cleaning, and more. For younger workers, the benefits of discounts on concession items and free movie passes for themselves and a friend will likely be very appealing and frequently utilized. The most stressful elements of the job, however, can be exceptionally stressful for first time workers. Dealing with the demands of irate customers, efficiently responding to rushes of customers or technical difficulties, cleaning up various spillages, and keeping up with a myriad of smaller chores can be difficult."
good,I loved my job when I worked there and it’s was a lot of fun. Every single manager I had was awesome and very reliable. Great place to work and sometimes easy to progress and advance if you do well.
good,I would say that Regal is a good company to work at. I started at floor level and moved up to management pretty quickly. The rewards or working there was that I was able to get free movies to enjoy with family and friends.
good,As an entry level usher you will struggle to walk the first few days after your shift. As you move up to concessions you will always be on your feet moving and planning ahead to try to make sure you are ready for the next rush. Once you move in to management you will have full autonomy to perform your daily tasks and manage your team. You will feel overwhelmed sometimes but other managers will always be available to help.
good,As a usher at regal cinemas you learn a bit about the film industry and upcoming movies. You deal with customers and there questions and complaints about the movie environment. Overall a good job for young adults and teenagers.
good,I loved it because I love being around movies and other movie lovers like myself. Being able to see free movies is a huge benefit. You get to learn to clean theaters and sell tickets and concessions.
good,Free movies. Discounted food and free drinks and popcorn  made some good friends. Able to transfer to other locations if a spotless employee and with recommendations
good,"It was a great place to work, an amazing first job.  my years there I learned a lot. management and employees all very friendly and supportive to one another."
good,"I loved my job at the movie theater. It was not difficult, but the corporation is losing money in the movie industry and is not worried about employees"
good,"The people who I worked with was pretty much the only reason I stayed as long as I did, coworkers and managers alike were all very nice and likable. However Regal clearly does not care about their employees. They inforced random rules you didn’t know about until you broke them. Not to mention the low pay for both the managers and the regular employees for the much larger amount of work that they both do. Overall I'd say my time there was decent but only because of the people who I was working with."
good,"A typical work day at Regal as an Associate Manager includes supervising a number of employees, tending to customer needs, daily inspections, duties, and showtime schedules."
good,"the work is good, the bosses are not so good, they are confusing and very picky about who to work with. they are very bossy and not considerate of other peoples feelings"
good,"I enjoyed almost everyday I was at that place. I worked my butt off and met many good friends. It was a great job. But its only good as a ""for now"" sorta deal."
good,Job seems like only a place to earn some money while still living with your parents. Would not choose it as a career choice. Highly recommended for students who need to earn some money.
good,i worked her through out high school and it was great for me then because it was a fun place to work and it gave me exposure to a lot of new things. They always did fun prizes for staff
good,"I have loved working at Regal since I was first hired. I haven't had any problems with no one there, i got along with every employee and manager except for one. Overall the job came with nice benefits like free movies and discounts on concession items for example. The only thing I had a problem with was the pay."
good,For someone looking for a good part time job I would defiantly recommend here as the hours are good amd jobs tends to be very easy. The scheduling is also very fitting to your needs
good,"Every week is different, it can be a nice and stress free one week and completely crazy the next. Most of the management are nice and friendly and make the job better. If you don't like working in one department, management will work with you to move you somewhere else."
good,The most enjoyable part of working there was the people. Everyone was friendly and got along well together. They managers where well respected. The hardest thing about the job is when it is busy.
good,"Great costumers great coworkers, I've learned how to work in the kitchen be a cashier. Management was great always on task. Workplace culture was great."
good,"Loved Regal with all my heart. It was my first job when I turned 16. I believed in the companies mottos and visions. It was definitely difficult at times, but if you ask anyone whose worked for regal.. it was good experience for other jobs. I worked for regal up till this year and only quit due to my completion of college. I would have went up the ladder if I could. But for how much the managers do compared to any other managers for different companies, we were fairly underpaid. And that's the only thing I would change about the company."
good,"The job is great for a while but after some time it does take its toll on you and the managers and it shows, I enjoyed it for the amount of time I worked there but I don't plan on working there again, but relationships built with your co-workers and managers are great it is a big family."
good,"I enjoyed my time at regal. The staff was always working hard when they needed to be, and the management didn’t mind having some fun When we didn’t have anything better to do."
good,"I have loved working for Regal Entertainment Group in Noblesville, IN. I am still employed at this business. I received this job in May of 2012, and worked at this theater throughout college as well. Now, that am graduated from Anderson University, I am seeking a higher paying job where I can use my degree in English and writing. While, I absolutely loved the environment of this position and the great managers and fellow employees, there is not much room for career advancement."
good,"This job can be very fun if you are around the right people on the job, I became good friends with everyone I worked with which made this job a lot better. They will give you all the hours you want and will cooperate with you around your schedule."
good,"Typical day would involve helping customers find their movie, serving food at concessions, setting up movies, and or selling tickets to customers. Good job for free movie tickets."
good,Perfect for teens in/or just out of high school. Fun and supportive staff and good movie goer perks. Only downside; very little advancement opportunities.
good,Regal has days that are busy and days that are slow. On busy days the job is fast paced and you must be able to work under pressure. Customers are often in a hurry to get to their movie and you do not want to further frustrate them by moving slowly. This is an easy job once you know your basics. All of your coworkers will be more than happy to help you learn:)
good,It's a fun atmosphere and a laid-back environment. No unreasonable requests are made of any employees and seeing free movies is a wonderful perk. I would recommend this job to anyone as a first ever job or a second job.
good,I enjoyed working for this company. It was a very good starter Job for me. I was able to move from a general floor cleaner all the way up to a Projectionist with Manager responsibilities
good,I enjoyed my time at Regal Entertainment group. the environment was very relaxed but very customer oriented. I learned to be professional and they allowed me to show my leadership and mentoring qualities. The most enjoyable part of the job was the business culture.
good,"Every day is a new challenge. no two days are ever the same. you will really learn what the phrase ""duties as assigned"" truly means working here. it is an extremely rewarding place to work at but be warned, it is not for the feint of heart."
good,"Was extremely fun to work there, although being a ticket taker without anything to do when it is 9:30 and barely anyone was coming in and not being given a seat, really stunk. I understand that you need to stand to be presentable though."
good,"It was only a high school job for me, in order to save some money for college and have some to spend at the time. It exposes kids to a lot of different people so I would definitely recommend it as a first job, beats the fast food industry anyway."
good,"A typical day at work consist of customers in and out of the theater. Purchasing tickets and concessions proceeding into the movie they'd been longing to see. I learned to always be extremely patient, have fun, and exceed customer service. The work place is fun and upbeat. It sometimes gets so busy and other times no one will be there. The hardest part of the job is cleaning up after people who leave behind objects or crazy, odd things. For example, some coworkers found men and women's underwear,  used feminine hygiene products, toys, alcoholic beverages, etc. The most  enjoyable part of the job is seeing people happy and helping them maintain that happiness."
good,"It is a pretty great place to work. The people you work with are almost always very easy to get along with and everyone has a good time at work. You have the opportunity to move around to different jobs within the theater, for example you can go from concessions to box office. The biggest perk was the two free tickets you could use at any time while you were off the clock."
good,"Free movies, very flexible schedule, decent pay with good management and a fun work environment , 4 time and a half holidays a year."
good,The amount of work and the few employees made the work fast paced.  It was my first job and I was happy to get the opportunity to make some money and learn responsibilities.
good,"A typical day at regal would start of slow and then picks up, depending on the shift worked. I've learned communication skills. Management really motivates you to get your work done. workplace culture is fun and professional. the hardest part of the job is closing. most enjoyable part of the job is the other workers."
good,"I enjoyed working at regal cinemas and learned a lot,  I learned how to make lots of different kinds of foods, like hot dogs, pizza, popcorn, sandwiches, etc."
good,"Easy work, great managers and coworkers. Benefits are great. If you don't like routine work or potentially late nights, this might not be for you. Keep in mind this is dealing with the general public, they can be a pain sometimes. Overall, I love this job and I'm very glad to have had that experience."
good,"Absolutely loved working here especially with the team members that were there. Management was always able to lend a hand and teach me new parts of the job which I enjoyed most of all."
good,"I was mainly working concession, but would also work: as box office (week days), as an usher (weekdays), and door (mostly on weekends). A typical day was usually a busy one, and tired everyone out. I learned how to help out customers with different situations, and learned how to remain calm in these situations. I learned how to work as a team with a group of workers who either had nothing in common or didn't like each other. Management was... interesting. There were many complaints made by other cast members, either people weren't treated nicely or didn't get what they needed. I didn't have many complaints though. I enjoyed working with my managers, although I was also the only person everyone got along with, so I liked working with almost everyone. There was a lot of drama where I worked...let's just leave it at that. The hardest part of the job was doing the same thing over and over. My last four months there I did door... every time, unless they needed a third concessionist then I'd be put on concession until the crowd died down. Other than that I remained on door, and I only worked weekends towards the end of my time there. Another hard part of the job was working with a group of people who didn't like each other or who didn't get along. The only person everyone would freely talk to was me...well there was a manager who everyone loved. The part I loved the most was having the ability to help people, and make them happy. I really enjoyed the customers and getting to know them. Honestly between the customers, and fellow co-workers it was like a family to me. Many people regretted"
good,"This was the first place I worked at, and it was an overall fun and enjoyable experience. Aside from a few unpleasant experiences, I would recommend it to anyone looking to make some money in a fun, refreshing environment."
good,Needs work on management. They need to become an more organized company. They take to long to have many changes to help make the environment better
good,"Typically, work just flows. If you're walking the theaters, it can be hard to keep up at times. It's definitely tough if you have a full theater of people and you have to count them in the dark while also staying on schedule. This job requires a lot of hustle to do well. Management was fine for the most part. There was one manager, while I was working there, that would become a bit unprofessional at times, in my opinion. But overall the managers were fine."
good,"Love my coworkers, without i wouldn't still be there. Management is okay, but tolerable. Most enjoyable part of my work are the people i see everyday."
good,"Regal was a great company to work for. I was hired on as part-time, but it didn't take long until I proved I was worth the 35 hours. I really enjoyed the benefits of a free movie plus one. Advancing in the company is a little difficult. After working for a year, the raise was a little under a dollar. Receiving employee of the month twice in a row felt like a real accomplishment though. I enjoyed my work experience there and learned a lot from management!"
good,"Working at Regal Entertainment was enjoyable as well as rewarding; daily activities consisted of sales of concessions, sales of tickets, up selling, promoting purchases, and facilities maintenance. While there I developed customer service skills as well as sales skills (i.e. up selling, promoting items, what to say to get people to buy more.). co-workers and management were enjoyable to work with as we formed a team unit and accomplished our goals. The most difficult part would be rude or unruly customers who did not agree with prices or policies, but to resolve this issue in a professional manner I would calmly explain why they were in place, and if the issue was not resolved then refer them to management. The best part of working there was the team aspect that management and my co-workers had, and as a result we got along better and accomplished more."
good,"Enjoyed meeting new people, get along well with coworkers, learned financial and order processing.  Regal Entertainment has been a movie provider for many years. Great opportunity to begin my work experience and provided training to new employees in order processing, customer service and transactions.  Flexible scheduling was beneficial to my school schedule, but could also be challenging due to the late night/early morning shift ends."
good,"Nice and chill place to work, managers are chill and all the coworkers are too.  Hardest part of the job would have to be standing in one place ripping tickets for majority of the day and not being able to slouch or sit down."
good,"Overall, working t Regal Cinema was a pleasant experience because it worked around my busy schedule with school but still allowed me to have really great hours on the weekend and some days during the week. The managers were great and the coworkers I had were amazing too. I learned very valuable customer service skills while I was working here and it taught me the valuable skill of multitasking and how to serve customers and allow them to have an overall enjoyable experience."
good,"My favorite thing about REG is the fact that my company stands behind delivering premium customer service. That has become quite rare. I know if I find a solution that will help exceed a guests' expectations, my company will stand with me."
good,The company has great benefits. If employee is willing travel there is room to advance. The corporation is growing. There are employee discounts and free movies.
good,"The work is boring and tedious, but that's an entry level job for you. People there are great and the managers are understanding."
good,"In my 3 years at Regal Entertainment Group I can say that working here is like a movie. At first your nervous because you're not sure how anything is going to go or you only have a broad idea of how things work. As you progress you start to get a bit more comfortable with the people around you and form attachments. Eventually you run into some problem that causes you to rethink what you're doing. Finally you reconcile by either overcoming the problem or moving on. "
good,"Great staff that worked well togther - nearest support was 3 1/2 hrs away from us so we had to be a strong team and work together"
good,REG is a great company to work for it has provided numerous opportunities to advance and shown me how to manage a large workforce.
good,It's a nice place to work but it is hard work. Good people work here and make the job better. Raises are hard to get and when you get them they aren't that big. It's a lot of work with not so great pay but you do get really good experience from it.
good,Weekends were always the most busy. Working concessions was fun and easy but was exhausting after certain amount of time. Management was always there and willing to step in at anytime.Co-workers were friendly and understanding. Leaned how to handle customers and money.
good,"A typical day at work would be either working in box office, cashier in concessions or cleaning theaters. I learned that there is a lot more to a movie theater than what everyone expects. I would have to say that the management could improve but over all good management and my co workers were the best. The hardest part about my job at Regal would have to be when a popular movie had been released because of the endless lines and trying to please all of your customers. The most enjoyable part about the job would have to be the amazing experience of making new friends and learning more about whats behind the sense of a movie theater."
good,"With new movies coming out every week, the job and the people you encounter continually change for better or for worse. Free popcorn and movies is never bad."
good,It was a blast to work for them. Got to see movies for free and screen them before they were released. I enjoyed working there and meeting new people.
good,A typical day at work was fun and high spirited. I learned how to work the box office management position. The management overall was decent. My co-workers were beyond amazing and we would hang out all the time. The hardest part of the job was not throwing up when removing garbage. The most enjoyable part was secretly goofing off with co-workers inside the theatres.
good,"A typical day at work is arriving and immediately familiarizing with the status of the shows - what was showing and what was ending. As floor staff we had a sheet that scheduled us to which theatres we had to clean at certain times. A typical weekday is a slow day, while a typical weekend is a fast paced work environment where everything must be done in a neat and fast paced order. I loved the fast pace, the feeling of being more productive ironically made me more productive, but the slow days were very easy as well."
good,"Working for Regal Cinema is what I imagine it was like dreaming as a kid running away to the Circus would be like,""Fun""! Free movies,free popcorn, free fun."
good,"Work consists of maintaining clean and safe work environment, assisting customers with purchasing, maintaining a cash register, preparing food, counting stock, and cleaning up after customers. Management was strict but fair. Co workers were friendly and enjoyable. Minimum difficulty job, only drawbacks were picky or excitable customers."
good,"The pay is minimum wage however, the culture is accepting open and the co-workers are like family."
good,It's a great starting job for high school and college students. THey work well with school schedules.
good,Doesnt pay much but is a fairly easy and fun job. Good for first time worker plus free movies.
good,"Very manual labor, walking up and down ailse cleaning, ripping tickets, cleaning bathrooms and hallways. Ice for concesions. However the co-workers were nice and polite, everyone seemed to get along like a tight nit family. No one really yelled at each other. The only bad part was the senior manager who would yell and get angry at the newer employees."
good,"Very easy job! The hardest part of the job is probably concession, it's extremely fast paced and safety is a huge concern. Easiest part is walking around cleaning theaters in the middle of the week while school is in session. Fun job, minimal pay for minimal work. Promoting is easy enough if your driven but pay doesn't get much better. Best part is that (at least when I worked at Edwards Cinemas) I could get 2 free movie tickets to any movie, and some free popcorn and soda."
good,Day to day I took tickets for customers along with sell them concession products. Between movies I would go in check to make sure everything was working right. After the movies got out I would go in an clean them. Co workers are very nice an super easy to get along with
good,"I would come in and confirm with management the duties for the day. Depending on the time of year i would either train employees or move to either helping customers or tech support for the projectors. I learned great management skills, customer service experience as well as the hardware and software for running projectors. My managers were great and more than cooperative how ever it was either hit or miss with the co-workers. The co-workers were either hardworking and cooperative or essentially lazy seeing as it is a typical first job. The hardest part was dealing with un-cooperative emplyees, but the most enjoyable was working with the management and well rounded co workers."
good,"Some days were slow, some were fast. I learned that you never know what your day at the movies will be like. Every movie release is different than others. Some managers were great, some had faves, and some were moody a lot. I had the best co-workers while working here. The hardest part abuot the job was closing by yourself on a very busy night. I loved to work on the busy premiere nights, because of of the crazy, fun customers."
good,"This is an excellent second job to have. The staff is great, the job itself is very easy, and the customers are some of the best I've ever experienced."
good,"I primarily deal with the guests so I always start my day by counting the money in a register and then selling popcorn and movie tickets to as many guests as quickly as I possibly can.  There are usually flurries of activity where I have so many guests I can't possibly keep up and then windows in between where I have time to clean and organize my register.  Each transaction is an opportunity to create a lifetime guest as well as make a sale.  In the box office I work hard to get as many donations as possible for our charitable organizations where I typically have a double or triple percentage of donations as the other cast members.  I attribute this to my ability to stay positive as well as size up guests quickly to figure out the best pitch for them.  In the concession stand I work hard to up size guest drinks and popcorn as well as suggest items that will fit into the rest of their order.  This allows me to do very well in our highest average competitions as well as our ""who can sell the most of _blank_ item competitions.""  "
good,"         A day at Regal Cinemas started differently depending on the position I was assigned that day, and the shift I was assigned. No matter the position, I would always do my best to help the customer with anything I could possibly do. Working at the movie theater was the first real job I had, and I learned basic work responsibilities while I was there. I learned to show up on time, how to manage my time better, and how to best serve the customer. The hardest part of the job was when we would have a massive crowd, and all the theaters would sell out. We would be in overdrive in every position, from the concession stand to the usher cleaning the theaters, but it was enjoyable at the end because it felt good to have come out successful as often I would help guide the team through any speed bumps encountered upon the way. I enjoyed my time there, as with my current job, it helped me grow as a person, both socially and personally. "
good,"Very easy to learn, running a register was the main task.  I learned how to cook popcorn properly, maintain an accurate register, and information about the entertainment industry in general.  The management and co-workers were nice, only left because it was time for a change in career paths.  Hardest part of the job was cleaning up auditoriums -- its not a good feeling to have to clean up after everyone in town.... Most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that you helped make someone's experience at the movies a memorable experience for any given reason."
good,"A typical day is always busy. customers 24/7. the management would always be back there helping at our busiest hours. all the co-workers got along and helped when help was needed. the hardest part of the whole jobs was the slean up and shut down of the concessions. wiping everything down, cleaning out the popper, sweeping and mopping the front and the kitchen. Most enjoyable part is meeting and interacting with the customers and seeing them with a smile on their face."
good,"I loved working at Regal Cinemas, however they were cutting back everyone's hours and now that I have graduated two to three days a week was not enough for me to get my life started. The engagement was pretty awesome for the most part. They are very flexible with the scheduled and help out as much as they can."
good,The job is fun and there is so much to do it never gets boring or monotonous. There is always a fun vibe and the staff moral is usually high.
good,"What I learned during my time with Regal Entertainment Group is that it takes a team to accomplish a task. From the highest ranked manager, to the lowest cast member, it takes maximum effort from every party to successfully run a business. The managers were always positive and in my case definitely boosted my morale. They also taught me everything I know about striving to succeed in the workplace. I enjoyed all aspects of my job. Serving every patron with the common goal in mind to come to work everyday and do the best I can to be the best I can."
good,"Regal is a lovely place to gain work experience and is a perfect fit as a starter job, for high school and college students. Unfortunately due to this jobs pay it is not completely desirable job for adults and young adults alike with financial obligations, unless a management position is obtained. The usual day consist of servicing costumers, weather it be printing or ripping their tickets and providing theater directions, or preparing their concession snacks or cleaning up them up.The management is friendly and can usually meet both the needs and wants of their employees. However they can be a little disorganized and often have miscommunication errors from time to time.A majority of regal management started out as regal floor staff and have no problem performing the duties of a regular employee or relating to them.Co-workers come in a variety of different attitudes like in every workplace, some positive some negative.The hardest part of the job is usually the overwhelming amount of customers that must be provided service during a rush, though overwhelming it is very manageable.Like most jobs the most enjoyable part of the job is when its done and all expectations have been met."
good,"I enjoyed the variety of tasks as an Assistant Manager. Learning to operate a film projector was a highlight. An average day is opening paperwork, setting up the theater for the theater for the day, and customer service."
good,"Each day at the movie theater was a small variation of the day before. When you worked in the box office you answered the phone and sold tickets. At the concession stand you make sure the popcorn is made fresh and other options for sale are fully stocked. Since the shows were on a cycle specifically for prepping theaters for the next show, you were either cleaning the theater or the restrooms. Then you would either sell concessions or usher the theaters."
good,Always work late nights with lots of business on weekends but it pays off with free movies.
good,"Preparation of theatre for 45+ staff, handled staff evaluations, inventory, all administrative tasks, opening and closing facility, etc."
good,I would count the safe and tills while through the day overseeing the floor. I would start each movie and deal with any customer issues from box office or consession. I started at 16 and worked my way up to management. We had an excellent General Manager and went two years with no turnover.
good,a day @ Regal was always super busy . you had to move around and provide great customer at the same time to ever customer
good,"Working at Regal was a great experience. When I started there, I was very shy and did not have experience working in teams or speaking to customers. After a few weeks I adapted and began to work more efficiently with my team members and most of all, help customers no matter what situation. Soon enough I began to lead the team as my manager spoke to me about my diligence. Working there for almost three years, allowed me to be an open person and value customer concerns."
good,"Pace of work was quite fast, especially during weekends, holidays, and the summer. Managers were hardworking and were willing to get down in the trenches with concessionaires as necessary. Expect messy uniform due to nature of the job and be prepared to be standing for long periods of time."
good,"Working in the movies is very interesting if you never had any experience in one. You have options to work in the kitchen,concession, etc. It comes with free movie benefits and its not a bad job."
good,good place to learn customer service skills and multiple areas of overall operations will be taught...management opportunities are possible..flexible days and hours.
good,"After 11 months of work experience here, the job is ideal for someone starting off as a beginning job. Training is short and job tasks are relatively easy to pick up. The culture of the workplace was very chill and they were flexible with scheduling with appropriate notification beforehand. Only complaint I have is that if you want more hours while working part-time, it is very hard to get them. Though the main reason for that was most likely the number of people that worked there, it could be agitating at times needing extra hours but being stuck with very little."
good,"Working at Regal was great, the workers and managers were very supportive and the work hours were very flexible which was great! And doing stock once a month with my other coworkers was also fun."
good,"It was a very educational time for me, allowing me to understand what customer service entails and how to best treat the customers. On the really busy days, the pace of getting everything done was quick and a bit stressful with people running around everywhere to get things done, but at the end of the day it's a satisfying experience overall."
good,"Great , Fun place to work at . Friendly staff, new and familiar faces everyday . Very rewarding System . Great benefits and deals . A bit unorganized most of the time ."
good,"Regal offers a fun work environment for all ages.  It's not a difficult job, and it's nice to get free movies and discounted concessions items.  I'd recommend for a part time job"
good,"It was my first job, and as a first job it prepared me well for the kind of things I'd need to be ready for in the workforce. Nice friendly team, with reasonable hours. Though reasonable hours to me, is never having less the 8 hours between close to open."
good,"fun work place, manager are very professional very understanding and helpful, everyone got along with very one , undramatic workplace, easy workflow, free movies."
good,Great place for kids for a first job or college students. Always work with your schedule. Pay is min wage to start. Almost all is part time. Managers are great if you're not a slacker.
good,The best 4 years of working there are the interactions with customers and friendships I had with co-workers. It is a fun environment and you will never be miserable working there.
good,"Great job and management, great hours and good area to work at. Employees where very helpful with the job and always helped one another to succesfully finish job"
good,The customers are very nice most of the time over the 12 years of being there I have became there favorite they would buy coffee snacks water and gave Xmas cards
good,Regal is a good place to work as they offer free movies to their employees and half off concessions. All of the other floor staff was very friendly and management was very understanding.
good,"Fun work environment, fun team culture; movie perks were appreciated; customers were the most difficult especially when hopping theaters, but for the most part, the work environment was fun with the team I had"
good,"Regal was a great first place to work especially as a new college student. All of my coworkers were around the same age range so the environment was really fun. The work itself is pretty simple, selling concession items to customers, cleaning theatres and selling tickets. Free movies every day was a very amazing benefit. However, the random schedules every week with some weeks barely getting any shifts made making money quite difficult."
good,"Good job for in college. Hours worked well, and being able to see movies was a perk. Enjoyed some roles more than others. Beginning job so not much to say."
good,"Regal Entertainment is considerate to accommodate college schedule with their own work schedules. The work environment is friendly and professional. I learned leadership skills, customer service and management skills"
good,"great place to start a new and first job. you learn a lot about costumer service. You see all the new movies that comes out first. discounts on concession stand, hours are flexible. Anytime you request a day off you will get it."
good,This job was extremely fun. I loved going to work with my friends everyday. Only down side is pay and sometimes they're understaffed for busy days. Overall I liked it
good,"Working at Regal's pretty nice place to be. Management is friendly and reasonable to the cast members' needs, hours are flexible with proper communication, and the time between rushes give you the chance to go beyond your requirements with other duties while still having time to talk with your fellow cast members. It's definitely worth working their if you love movies and interacting with guests."
good,"Regal is filled with great people from floor staff to managers, but the job is stressful on busy days (which varies based off movies in theaters) and they pay the absolute minimum."
good,Job was great and fun. Only downsides is seeing how terrible humanity can be with impatience and the utter carnage of trash and debris left from even one person who thinks having a picnic in the floor of an auditorium is a good idea. But upsides are great coworkers and some great people who would come to see movies.
good,"Very fun work environment. All the managers and co-workers were very friendly. It's a pretty fast-paced job, you constantly have something to do which I really enjoyed because I like to be constantly working and having something to do. The best part of the job was the people I worked with. We felt like a family, everyone was so close and it was a very comfortable, non-judgmental environment."
good,"There are good opportunities to advance.  Hardest part is dealing with people during rushes.  Management is okay.  Free movies are very enjoyable.  You have to answer a lot of the same questions to customers.  Customers don't always understand that we don't set prices, or anything like that.  You need to have thick skin, or just understand that people aren't always attacking you personally.  You really need to be a patient ""people person"" to work any register or customer service positions.  If you're not a people person you can always be an usher."
good,"Usually, you would either be in concessions, cleaning or checking theaters, tearing tickets, or in box office. You start off working concessions and work your way up to box office depending on how long you work there for. The management there is amazing, super nice, but serious about their job. The workplace culture is also really good, and I have made a lot of good friends throughout my time working there. I learned a lot about customer service and how to properly interact with customers. The hardest part would be a 9+ hour shift as an usher, seeing that you are on your feet for a majority of that time. The most enjoyable though would have to be that same scenario though, because I had some of my best interactions with people that I was working with during that time."
good,"If you're young and looking for your first job, Regal is a really good company to start at. It does not have high pay, but it's also not stressful at all. You will make a lot of friends there, and the management team was amazing."
good,"Working at Regal Cinemas was a very stressful but fun job experience. It was typically really busy, but sometimes, especially over the summer during morning shifts they would over staff and end up cutting shifts without letting you know until you arrive. The benefits were pretty good, free movie tickets and discounted concessions. The only reason I left was the manager was extremely rude to me and once insinuated that I was illiterate."
good,"Working for regal is great. My managers were all fantastic, including general manager. we received discounts and paid time off. there we're multiple jobs throughout the day and the only one that truly sucked was ripping tickets at the door. My coworkers were like a family and the whole team would get together outside of work often."
good,A typical day at regal was insane on weekends but you will get use to it if you had to work the register. But other than that it was laid back just cleaned the theatre when movie was finished.
good,"Regal was a fun place to work, a lot of the people were younger(my age) so I always felt comfortable from the first day with is being my first job. I highly recommend working here. I don't know about long term I think it takes a while to advance in the company but i'm not sure. I had a good time working there."
good,I learned how to use the Register and how the movie business works and that a lot of actors and actresses started there. Overall it was a good starting job for any high school student.
good,"Regal entertainment Group is a great place to work if your still in school or looking for a part time job. The 2 Benefits they offer are 2 free movie tickets per day, and half off in concession items."
good,Fun easy job for students and people who do not want full time work hours. Free movies and a good working environment. Managers were helpful and seemed to care about employees. Relaxed scheduling but no overtime.
good,Great place to work for college kids. They have a rule where they can cut your hours if its not busy. But overall a good place to work. The managers are great.
good,"It was fun working at the movie theater. Before it was Regal, it was Cobb Theaters. With Cobb Theater employees got 2 free movie passes plus 2 more guests will be $1 each service charge. 4 people going to the movies for $2. Then for Regal employee and 1 guest for free."
good,"maintained the theater thoroughly, cleaned concessions, bathrooms etc.."
good,This job was a great place to start  l love my co workers and management  was great  and understanding they truly made my first job a success thany you.
good,"Regal was my first high school job. I loved every second working there. My managers and co-workers were nice. Plus you got free movies and a discount on all the food, drinks, and candies. I definitely recommend this for a first time job."
good,learned a lot about management for Regal and what they expect from its employees and managers. the only issue is that it is open for business 365 days a year including all major holidays.
good,"- always something different which kept the job enjoyable and interesting"
good,It's super friendly there and all the managers were very kind.  I never had a single problem with any of my managers.  My coworkers we're just as friendly and kind and fun to be around.
good,I enjoyed working for Regal as I got to learn the ins and outs of a movie theatre. The people and managers were great people to work with as well as you become a part of the regal family over time.
good,"Other than being payed terribly, the management is fun and supportive, they will help you if you need and are only strict when they need to be. I had a ton of fun and worked there for over two years. I would have stayed longer if they pay was better.vrs"
good,"This job was overall a great place. If it weren't for the low hours and for more compensation then I would have stayed. However, I love the benefits of being able to go to the movies for free with one ticket included per day."
good,Regal was a good working environment that pushed you to sell as much as you could by having a competition going on between all of the workers. they had very understanding managers.
good,Makes a good summer job. Get to work with people. You learn how to deal with a single parent that has a group of children. You learn how to deal with grumpy people.
good,I would recommend this job to anyone especially as a first job because the environment is more inviting than the typical fast food. The starting pay is not great but the hours once summer comes and the holidays make it worth it.
good,"I think this wasa great place for my ffirst job, I worked there for two years and had a splendid time. The managment was good, they knew when to lay down the law and when it was time to relax and clean, stock etc. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there."
good,The management is very easy to work with and helpful. The coworkers are definitely some of the nicest people I have met. I have learned a lot of independency like taking care of your own station and area.
good,Great place to work friendly staff good Management staff willing to work with school schedule and very accommodating.  Great benefits free movies and half off on concessions.
good,"This was my first job as a college freshman and I really enjoyed it. The managers were very helpful and professional and made the working environment very comfortable. Worked long hours but got discounts on tickets to movies and food at the concession stand. Many of the workers there were young, in high school or college so it is a very playful and energetic environment. Closing shifts were fun but that didn't mean you could slack off. Learned teamwork, patience, promptness, neatness, and customer service skills."
good,I had a great time there. Everyone there was extremely nice and would gladly work with them again. I met new friends that i could talk to. I especially enjoyed the free movies.
good,Very fun environment to work in. Get to manage many young people who are working there as their first jobs and mold them to help them become successful.
good,Working at the theater itself was pretty fun but on a day to day basis you do deal with frustration whether its other coworkers or customers but that can happen at any job.  The frustration i feel happens more at a theater because of the amount of people that you have to deal with from time to time but having other coworkers to help fill in was a big help.  The management at least for me was really good and they tried hard every day to help manage the theater.  Some managers though actually helped out the ushers and concession and some managers didn't contribute at all or as much as they should.  Sometimes there would also not be an understanding of the stress that ushers and concession would be going through which made the work environment hard sometimes.  What was really enjoyable about the job was making friends with the coworkers and having those times of laughs while cleaning the theater or taking out the garbage to the compactor.
good,"This was my first job and it was a great start. Is it the most luxurious job? Of course not, but it was a way to start making money and it's a great way to get some job experiences for a resume."
good,"I had a great time at my location and was able to learn a lot, I surprised myself as I grew into management. I recommend the theater environment for anyone passionate about cinema."
good,"Its a fun place to work, especially if you love movies. The only thing that bugged me personally was that they didn't give out a lot of hours. I would have to ask over and over again for more hours, but end up getting less."
good,"Working here is a great experience, and it’s always a fun time no matter how busy the theater is. Seeing people’s faces light up when they come to see movies is what keeps everyone going!"
good,"I only had to this job to hold me over until I got into the Army, but while I was there it was definitely a great place to work. My co-workers were great and the discounts for working there were awesome."
good,"It was a fast pace place where you meet a lot of interesting people. You could go catch a movie once you got off of work, thanks to their benefits.you will always experience something new work at Regal Cinemas."
good,Be prepared on standing on two feet or long periods of time. Be respectful to the guests with any questions they have. Maintain a positive attitude with other coworkers.
good,"Regal has it's ups and downs just like any other jobs. I've been there while, but can say, the managers and my co-workers are some really great people."
good,I loved working for Regal however I wished they offered more hours and more raises.  Management is great.  Need more full time positions.  When the college kids come back the workers that are there all the time are kind of pushed to the side; very unfair.  The good part is you get free movie tickets and discounted concession.
good,this defiatly wasnt my favorite job but it was okay. kind of chill except managers seemed to get mad at random things that made no sense and it was hard to keep up with all the rules
good,Days range from long to short depending on time of year. Management was great but a bit difficult to get to know. Hardest part of job is dealing with customers during premiers.
good,"its a cool fun place, managers and staff are young and hip. Hours are flexible but inconsistent, one week you can get 15 hours, and the next 30+ hours."
good,"Its a fun place to work, the managers are funny, cool, amazing and understanding. For the most part it isnt too busy because it depends on what movies are currently out, but when it does get busy it can get a little hectic. Because of when it gets hectic i learned how to handle large amount of customers in short periods of time."
good,I learned how to use a cash register and how to work in a fast paced environment that involved doing a lot of small jobs at once. The crew there are awesome and are very helpful in learning the job.
good,"Most of the time, you will be assigned a job to do, and you are expected to do your job right. It isn't necessarily a bad thing, but you shouldn't have the manager watch over you and be able to take care of your own duties on your own. "
good,it was super fun working here. free movies but i worked part time while my freshman and sophomore years in college money wasnt too good but im sure now the pay is better
good,Management is very focused on customer service. The theater can get busy but the environment is relatively nice. The lines usually come in waves but even when it's slow you have to keep busy.
good,"A typical day would entail me working one of the many different types of jobs in the movie theater. I could have been working concessions, box office, usher, or door."
good,a typical work day was NEVER slow working with regal. management was nice and the pay was great! they give GREAT hours and great discounts for workers.
good,"I worked at Regal for about five years. It was a great experience. The management was awesome. It's a cool part-time job. The pay is not that attractive but hey, you get free movie tickets as a perk."
good,This is a good place to work while going to school. They have several shifts and you get to watch new movies. You do need to Belinda willing to clean the theaters after the movie showing.
good,It depend on what position you had to work that day. It was very quick-paced or slow or always had to be productive. The workplace is great everyone is friendly and get along with one another. I learned just to multitask better and cash and handling things better.
good,"Started off as a floor staff member (usher, concession, and box office) about 4 years ago, and just got promoted to associate manager in April 2017."
good,"Very fun and exciting workplace. Sometimes fairly busy and hectic depending on what movies are out, but overall a great job for highschool graduates or to build customer service"
good,Oversee daily operations while managing and scheduling of over 30 employees.  Ensure daily inventory levels are accurate.  Plan forecast for the next week.
good,The employees are great to work with and the job is very easy and sometimes can be stressful. The workplace is very friendly and have no problems in the work place.
good,The people there are great and it’s not a hard job! Overall a great part time job! Not great pay tho (minimum wage ) and you only get like 3 days a week!
good,"Fun workplace, free movies, discount on concessions. Management it just depends on how the person is. Hardest part of the job is dealing with customers and managers on top of you making sure you say everything line by line. Adding to discounts you also get discounts on certain telephone carriers and other things as well."
good,"Fun place to work, good hours; very felxibal."
good,"The only things that have changed are the prices of tickets and the prices of concessions, Other than that it is a great place to work with good benefits"
good,"Regal recently acquired the company I used to work for. Nothing drastic has changed, but they are a much larger company and it shows - way more busy work and far less autonomy. On the whole, it's still a movie theater. Lots of fun when it's slow, and chaotic when it's busy. It's a great job for students, but I wouldn't suggest making a career of it."
good,it is the easiest job I have had by far. I felt like half the time I had nothing to do which really sucked. But it was awesome to get free movies! so that was cool.
good,"Concessions has all the action."
good,I feel that the hours are inconsistentI feel like they don't offer any good benefits I also feel that some of the managers are incompetent to even be managers
good,This was a summer job. It was a great place to gain customer service experience. Friendly atmosphere. Not what I wanted as a career though.  Working there also taught me how to work well with others.
good,"Regal Cinemas was a good company to work for part time while I was attending college in San Antonio, TX. It was a minimum wage job, but at the time was all I really needed."
good,A typical day at work is getting there and it being slow but when the more popular movies are out and it gets to be around noon a rush of people start coming in and you are busy for hours then it slows down again. Some times it ends up getting so slow that they will end up sending some people home early.
good,Worst part about this job was the hours they had you work. Quickly learned how to communicate and deal with customers and how to work as a team to keep business flowing properly
good,"Management is fun and down to earth. They work with you, and for you as an employee. For the most part, the customers are kind and understanding. The job seemed a bit understaffed during the day, due to customer traffic being low, but there is plenty of time to do the required work and enjoy some down time while still being vigilant. Moderately stressful at times, just like any other job. Would probably still be there if I had wanted a management position."
good,"This job was a fun place to be for a student being in High School and needed a little extra cash to earn. Great place to start as a first-time employee looking for a chill and cool job. Nothing is hard about this job, extremely easy and flexible with hours."
good,Working at the movies is a fun environment. The managers are super nice and understanding. The pay is not good compared to the amount of work and expectations.
good,"While performing my job as a concessionist was fun, I met great people. The only hard thing about the job was standing for a long time. I learned a lot when it comes to dealing many people with different attitudes and personalities."
good,it was nice working there good experience if it wasn't a seasonal job would probably still be working there. The Management was really nice and willing to work with you if you had trouble or was unsure if you were fit for the job.
good,Great workplace for teenagers looking for employment or young adults. Fast paced environment great hours and they will employ you if need employment..
good,I like working for Regal because i got the chance to meet people from all over the world and i saw every new movie that came on the market. Its definetly
good,The work environment was always light and fun.  Co-workers were invested in what they were doing and there was a strong sense that hard work would be rewarded.
good,Working there is easy most of the time. The customers can make things a bit difficult if they're rude and stuff but everything will be okay if you know how to keep your cool. Most of the people working there are young so it's easy to get along with one another.
good,The coworkers were very friendly and helpful. I really enjoyed working there. It does get really busy on sundays and Tuesdays though and it can be frustrating when guests are rude. Cool benefits. 40% discount on concession items and you get two free movie tickets a day for you and a guest.
good,"I loved my job at Regal Cinemas. Unfortunately I had to moe on to bigger and better things. The main reason I left was the low pay, but overall great management and great company."
good,Excellent experience.  Left on good terms.  I am rehireable. I would recommend this company to a person that has upward mobility and interested in joining a company that will provide great opportunities.
good,"A typical day was one or the other, busy or slow. But customers are usually nice and so are staff. Employees are fun to work with and there's time to yourself depending on your position."
good,"Work is usually enjoyable, most employees are friendly. Management executes their job well, they are able to get the employees to do their jobs well without being agressive/intimidating."
good,"The pay is good, it's pretty fast paced, but a bit demanding. Regal theaters are open 365 days a year and holidays are the busiest days and are tough to get off for."
good,Nice work environment with friendly coworkers and managers. Very understandable rules with good amount of work. Good break times and good amount of hours.
good,"Regal is a fun company to work for. It is fast paced, and it teaches leadership and organizational skills. I love my co-workers and the management staff. They have become like family to me."
good,"Responsible for serving the customers, also cleaning the theater's, cleaning the bathrooms, and being responsible for making sure the theater is at its best at all times."
good,"Amazing business, amazing management, good benefits, holidays off. The customers were very respectful and employees got free movie tickets."
good,Regal Entertainment Group is a clean and well managed movie theatre. I enjoyed all my co workers and management. as it was my first job when I was 16 I learned responsibility and lots of customer service techniques
good,"I enjoy working at Regal Entertainment Group. The staff is quite friendly and we all work as a team to meet our goal each shift. Management does a great job in helping the staff during difficult times and make each work day fun but productive. The amount of hours one would get depends on if it will be a busy weekend or not. It can be 15 hours one week to 30 hours the following week, depending on your position there. It is not a steady income to rely on. Despite the cons, the most enjoyable part of this job is the workplace relationships with the other coworkers that make this an exciting place to be at."
good,Absolutely loved working for Regal Cinemas. Management was always caring and professional. Staff was very active and helpful
good,"Great workplace to be apart of. The managers made it very easy to learn and grasp the concept of the company, protocol and procedures. I learned how to be quick on my eyes, feet and hands, how to be efficient in everything that i did to make a successful sale and work day."
good,"The people I worked with were great. Perks of the job: free movies and movie posters. The busy times of the year weren't the best and stressful, but overall you learn a lot about people."
good,I enjoyed working at Regal Entertainment Group. Employees were given opportunities to move up the ranks. I had a great rapore with the staff.
good,"You come to work and learn to up-sell to bigger sizes of cups and popcorn bags.The managers are helpful and understanding to all employees.You clean about all types of peoples likes in movies, they spend their money on.I learned that not everyone likes to be up-selled in the transaction."
good,"I have been working for Regal for a year now and its been good. The environment and all the people who work here are really cool! They work with your availability and are very flexible with it! I really like that. Since it is a theater, getting hours fluctuate! One week you'll get alt of hours and then the next you'll barely work, which sucks since your paycheck isn't always the same! With that being said, Regal is good."
good,fun working place that help me gain better work ethics. I learned how to be a working man getting the chance to work in the movie theater was a great learning experiences.
good,"I learned that time is everything and a clean working environment is a happy working environment. Customer service is always key because you work for your customer, so you have to keep them satisfied at all times."
good,"managers were awesome, co-workers were team players i love working with customers on a daily bases. making popcorn was fun, working in Box-office was exciting"
good,Fun place to work especially as a college student. Management is very well and nice. The part I enjoy the most is the free movies we get for working at the theater. All employees are very kind and friendly.
good,"R.E.G is a fun place to work at. You will spend a lot of time there during big release films, some nights you might end up closing and then opening a department the very next morning. A good balance between work and personal life is kept at a very good spot. Of course there are always going to be obnoxious customers to deal with but that comes with every place. And as always, it never hurts to see the movie everyone talks about for free."
good,Regal is a big place with a lot of wonderful people. It is a fun place to work when you work there straight out of high school. A good place for a first job.
good,"Simple tasks requiring minimal effort."
good,It was a great place to work. My coworkers and managers were the best part about the job. The benefits werent that great but at least they worked with your schedule.
good,I think it was a fun enviroment to work in. I liked all the employees and managers.
good,"Cleaning auditoriums,check it up every 40 minutes,helping kitchen staff,moping kitchen area,throwing the trash outside theatre,checking restrooms.There is no hardest part if you know how to do your job.For this 7 years I have no problem with customers , management or co-workers.Unfortunatelly landlord decide to build some store in this place so the theatre does not exist anymore.That is why I am looking for similar job."
good,"good job to start with"
good,"very productive job, inbound calls 65+, outgoing calls 30+,management are always attentive making sure employees are in need of assistance"
good,"Working at the concession stand was a great experience because I would come in contact with people from all different cultures and ages. I also learned how to speed up so I can get the person what they have bought so they can get into their movie. "
good,"A typical day at work consists of helping between 200 and 1500 people either by serving them food, directing them to their theater, helping them decide what movie they would most likely want to see, or answering any question they have. I have learned how to keep smiling even after someone has screamed in my face. The hardest part of my job is keeping the lines down when there is upwards of 2500 people in the theater. The most enjoyable part of my job is being in charge of an area when there isn't enough managers to watch all three of them."
good,"I enjoyed working and making my own money."
good,"This job is mainly for younger adults who have a flexible schedule and don't mind working weekends and staying late. Its a good opportunity if you plan on sticking around because of advancement. Somedays get really hectic, you have to be able to be on your feet and moving quick for hours at a time. Everybody comes together as a team to get stuff done effectively and it can be fun. Ive made a lot of friends at this company."
good,"Responsible for cleaning theaters, and ensuring all projectors were functioning properly prior to the movies opening. Managed all employees on theater cleaning shift ensuring that all employees were given adequate lunch breaks. As a result Regal Entertainment stayed within state laws. Management was great and co-workers were very fun to work with and had lots of fun while at work."
good,This is a fast paced hob with lots to do. The staff and management are friendly and helpful.
good,"Great work environment with good management. Loved the people I worked with and the job wasn't too hard. The benefits were great! Free movies, popcorn, soda, and discount on all the food! Bomb job!"
good,"No day is the same. one shift i  can be behind the concession stand, helping clean the theaters, selling tickets, restocking, or making sure the movies were being shown on time."
good,"clean up after customers, tear tickets, theater walk"
good,"I've enjoyed my time being employed at Regal, I found it to be a very nurturing environment."
good,working in box office was a breeze we sold tickets and in concessions all we did was fixed food and made sure customer was satisfied even though the lines were long it still was fun.
good,At Regal Entertainment everyday is interesting. You get to see all the latest movies for free. At Regal i learned that i should try to make a connection with my customers. Every customer likes to feel at home.
good,I only worked here for a season and during those weeks I had a good experience. The majority of management was very nice as well as associates. I enjoyed helping people choose what they wanted to eat as well as directing them to their theater. Had I worked here longer I'd have more to say.
good,"There are slow days, typically a week day, then you have your busier ones, your Friday-Sunday. On a busy day you'll have a stampede of customers anxious to see the newest, action packed films of the year. A company cannot run with it's feet tied, so of course we need a lot of hands on deck, so there is a large handful of co-workers. Some exceed expectations, which is expected, and a few do not. As a young man, I realized the vast and varied amounts or characters you can meet within a few minutes and the occasional roller coaster ride of arguments, complaints, and the eventful outcome of a satisfied/unsatisfied customer. There are some people who are a bit more assertive than others, but of course it's our duty to try to please each and every customer that walks through the opening doors. But in the end, it's worth seeing the resulted smiles, frowns, tears, grins and even the scrunched up, angry face of a customer who just finished their movie because they were able to comfortably watch what they paid for and gotten a result as they wanted."
good,"Cleaning up trash, watching the end of movies, counting people, its really a good summer job that doesn't need much work."
good,"Working at Regal Cinemas was my favorite job I've worked! The Staff was friendly and the management was willing to step in and aid anybody who needed help. On a typical day id either open concessions or box office. followed by keeping things stocked and traffic flowing! The hardest part of the job would be working some holidays, but it was worth it! The most enjoyable part of the job was that frequent returning guest s would remember you!"
good,This is a great company to work for. Great benefits and fun environment.
good,"Life is pretty simple at Regal. The pay isn't great, but its not that hard of the job."
good,"you have to have extremely good customer service & if you don't, it's okay you'll learn on the job. that's kind of how they train you, on the job, train as you go. employees are fun to work with but guests can be a bit rude depending on how busy it is. overall great place to work if you have no experience in the job force."
good,It was a fun place. Meet alot of great people.. Your hours was good and flexible.. Alot of good movies.. They teach you how to do everything.. I wish i was still there.. Management was good..
good,Overall working for this company was great..... I have no real complaints about the company..... Enjoyed my co-workers and managers. Many friendly faces made work feel more welcoming and enjoyable.
good,I enjoyed working at regal but it has its ups and downs. They teach you what you need to know sometimes. I wasn't trained properly for one or two of the positions.
good,I enjoy going to work here every day is better than the other day and the managers here try and help there fellow employees. The owners try to have our best interests
good,"Regal was a fast paced environment to work in, especially on the weekends. The management was great and they work with you to find the perfect schedule."
good,"I had two general managers in my time here, and I loved and looked up to them both. My coworkers and I have a great relationship, and they are the main reason I’ve stayed as long as I have. The members of the management team were as much my bosses as they were my friends, and I value the relationships I created here greatly."
good,Very flexible with personal things in your life. There were things going on with my children that they allowed me to tend to without having to worry about if i had a job when i came back.
good,This job will teach you how to manage your time. Your constantly working. Hardest part was trying to keep up with the show times and cleaning the theatres.
good,It's a good working environment respectful mangers and employer. Sometimes you will have a tough crowd but the employer still work  to get there work done .
good,"the average day at my regal was just three employees, one manager(two as the other was the general manager of that regal), one floor staff at the concession stand and technically box office as it was moved back, and one floor staff as usher. this was filled with rather empty space waiting for customers, often one could finish all required duties and still be waiting. though that was for the opening shifts then when it shifts to closing more people were added on. Box office was moved back to the front, ticket taker, and second person at concessions to help with the increase of customers. "
good,I loved working there I recommend anyone to work there. The managers are really nice and will always help you during an emergency for example car accidents or family problems.
good,The management was comprised of some of the nicest people I have met. They treat the staff very well and interact with customers well. They are forgiving of small mistakes and will help you if needed. The work isn't particularly difficult just tedious and keeps you on your feet at times.
good,"So working at a movie theater sounds like the greatest deal ever, but you have to take in to perspective everything you have to do at a Theater. Or at least, what you have to do 3 hours of work the entire day at a theater. "
good,"Long hours but great management, should be paid more and paid for breaks. Great benefits (if you like free movies). Very flexible with schedule and can be fun during its craziest moments."
good,"always something to do, fun and fast-paced. Every week there's something new to learn. Very little situations that was stressful. very easy environment to over come obstacles"
good,"As a concessions worker, undivided attention is required to greet and sell concession items to customers. The managers here were great and knew how to manage the staff well. The hardest part of the jobs was working the late night closing hours, sometimes not leaving until 3am during big movie premieres for such little pay."
good,"There was lots of room for advancement and unlimited free movies.  Flexible and unique scheduling opportunities.  Sometimes it was boring, sometimes it was fast-paced."
good,"This job was fun. I worked it as an adult and I was surrounded by younger high school students. It was fun, but I felt a little old. I worked all over the building, taking tickets, walk through the theaters, ticket sales and food sales. All of it was fun minus the nightly cleaning, which I knew I had to do, but didn't love. It was the only place that everyone in town would go to, because there isn't too much more to do in town. Moving up was very easy if you had some responsibility. I moved to concession supervisor and even almost became manager before I quit and moved into banking."
good,"Start Food prep for the day, clean theaters when needed, create floor displays for upcoming movies, clean up at the end of the night."
good,"But it is a movie theatre, you can go far if you have the patience. The pay is decent for a starter job, but the real value is in the free tickets. Most of the managers are pretty cool, but some of them take the job too seriously. As a manager, this job isnt super serious, so dont take it as such."
good,"As a primary closing supervisor, I often stayed until 1am in the morning to close down the theater. While it was busy work, it was enjoyable and my coworkers were not only great as workers, but also as companions. Overall, I loved this job and only terminated it due to schedule problems regarding college. If given the chance, I would gladly work their again"
good,"Before I became a Shift Leader for Del Taco, I would look forward to work, but shortly after I became a manager, some of the employees would abuse the fact that I was a newer manager. They would take very long breaks, and would come into work late. "
good,"The company itself is great, the theater I was employed at was a breeding ground for actual bullying. There were several teenage suicides in the area related to bullying and when presented with this news the employees saw no reason to calm it down and the bullying bordered on illegal activity when people started messing with others food/drink and safety procedures."
good,This was my first job and it was the best! I had a temp. position but it was just enough to get me on my feet and to know what i wanted to do. It was over the summer so great spending money :)
good,"While co-workers and management staff worked great together, the amount of you were paid did not equal the amount you were paid which was poorly. Slightly over minimum wage after being promoted to management. Provided excellent learning opportunities. However none of these opportunities provided me with useful skills for other jobs."
good,"Typical weekdays are slow weekends can get really busy"
good,Its an awesome entry level job for teens in high school or that just graduated.  Management was awesome while there and it was always cool being able to watch movies for free!
good,"Amazing group of people to work with. Loved everybody I worked with. The work was simple, but fast paced. Advancement opportunities are there, but not much higher than a manager, so depending on what you're looking for it could be a great chance. Very flexible work schedule. It can be very strict about trivial things, possibly the most frustrating aspect of the job."
good,I learned a lot from Regal. I loved how it was fast paced work on the weekends or when really good movies came out. The most enjoyable aspects of working for regal were definitely the benefits and the management.
good,The managers really made the environment great there while working. The hardest part about this job was leaving because I made great friends there.
good,Very busy days at work when new releases came out. I learned how to multitask while working under pressure. The management was very good. Co workers were very friendly and supportive of one another. The hardest part of the job was to clean multiple theaters by yourself and have them ready before customers came in to sit down. I enjoyed dressing up in an MnM costume and sell concession items in the theaters to sold out shows
good,"I liked this job because every shift was a different task. One day was box office, another concession or usher. always something to do and something new."
good,It's a good job to work at if you are starting off for the first time. the management is great and the co-workers are great to work with too.
good,"A typical work day at the Regal Cinames movie theater was coming opening up concessions, preparing the popcorn and stocking supplies needed for 400+ customers. I learned how to work with money and deal with customers in need. The managers and coworkers were all in sync with each other throughout the work day, so it made everything move along fluently"
good,Overall working at Regal Cinemas was a good experience. Everyone was easy to get along with and they were all really nice. There wasn't really anything hard about the job whatsoever and the most enjoyable part of the job was everyone getting along with each other like we have known each other for years.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of making popcorn, serving drinks, making nachos,hot dogs, pretzels basically any snack or food that the theater sells.  Also it involves crossing paths with everyone who lives in the city because everyone enjoys the movies. Working at Edwards West Covina has taught me customer service experience. Also keeping my patients under pressure. The management is very professional and helpful. Most of the managers started off as a regular employee and worked their way up, so they know what it was like to work concession,box office and being an usher. Also they were very helpful they would try and help us out with customers whenever they possibly could. They were always very helpful and tried to accommodate the customers whenever they could. My co workers were amazing. They made the work place an enjoyable place to be and made my shifts go by fast. Everyone would try and help each other out with whatever they could do especially when it was a busy day. The hardest part of the job was on Sundays because movie tickets are only six dollars, hot dogs are two dollars and the nachos are three dollars so this is a bargain. So one Sundays it would get hectic and extremely full so everyone was working at a fast pace and sometimes the customers would come right on time for their movie so would get frustrated when the lines where not moving fast enough.Also closing was a pretty hard part since the theater closes twenty minutes after the last movie showing so that time would vary. The most enjoyable part was crossing paths with everyone in West Covina. Getting"
good,"Typically I am responsible for inventory and cash management as well as staff management, customer service, and some technical troubleshooting. My co-workers are interesting and easy to work with and management is very approachable and receptive."
good,open the concession stand and prepare all the food and machines for the day. I learned that how to multitask task very well and fast. The management was great. My co-workers were a very live and friendly crew that i loved. Everybody worked together fantastically and was very reliable to do their job thoroughly. There wasn't anything i would really consider hard at all about this job. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendly environment and the people you meet visiting from all over the world.
good,"Great benefits, and very flexible hours. Only downside are the occasional arguments with a manager."
good,Working in the theater was hard work as a manager. As a manager you are the only manager in the building with one or two other employees with you at once. My biggest challenges came from working in a theater that was older and had a lot breaking down all the time. The theater closed down summer 2013.
good,"Working at REG you learn a lot about cash handling if you are in Box Office and Concession. You go through hundreds of transactions a day and learn how to work professionally , effectively, and efficiently."
good,I like the people I worked with and I enjoyed my job at Regal Cinemas
good,"Manage up to 40 employees, provide guest service, cash handling, counting inventory. I learned how to multi-task efficiently and in a timely manner. I learned how to manage a business and learn about payroll. I also learned about profit and loss margin sheet and ordering stock. My general manager is great and has a hands on approach. The hardest part of the job is being away from my family as I only work nights. It would be nice if I had day shifts here and there. The most enjoyable part of my job is having free movie passes as well as their 401K and benefits."
good,"I enjoy working for Regal. It's a fun company to work for, but the hours aren't so great. I barely ever get to work."
good,"enjoyed working with the company, very flexible with hours and school. managers are great and fun and very helpful"
good,"Regal is a very great place to work, easy but sometimes can be challenging but Overall a very great work place, management is very understanding and uplifting"
good,"I truly liked working at regal. Managers were always helpful and did everything they could to help out staff and made everyone feel at home. Its a shame I had to be let go, if given the chance I would definitely go back to working for the company."
good,I enjoyed almost everything about working for Regal Cinemas. I was treated fair and was given a great work experience. Management was proper and employees were very reliable.
good,It is a really good job and very productive. Good management the benefits are good as well. The hardest part of the job was when it would be really busy the cleaning has to be done way faster when it usually takes time to do it
good,"It's easy to get hired, has good enough pay and benefits. There are definitely easier and better places to work but for a first time entry level job you can fill your resume with a variety of experience from cooking to sales to bartending, cleaning, and customer service, and It's a fun place with great people."
good,"Good Job, hours weren’t good, didn’t want to work just weekends anymore, wanted at least 20 hours. Floor staff was lazy managers are well to work with great people,"
good,"I loved my job at Regal and the only reason I left was because I had to relocate. All of the people I worked with were hard workers and they all did their share of work. On top of that all of the managers were fantastic, they were understanding when people couldn't make it to work and they always were able to find someone to fill in. On top of that the atmosphere of the work place was amazing, and everyone was very outgoing and friendly. In all reality if i didn't have to move I'd still be working there now."
good,I loved working here as the staff and managers were nice and always working together. There were many different things to do throughout the day which meant you were always moving.
good,"An exciting job where everyone helps eachother out. Some days are slow and laidback, other days are very busy and fast-paced. Great way to learn customer service skills. Not a difficult job other than the tough customers. Can be with the company for many years and be promoted if you are dedicated and willing to relocate to other buildings."
good,"Most of the managers at my location were easy to work with and talk to. Coworkers were a hit and miss, but as long as you communicate the job is easy."
good,working at Regal is a very fun place to work. The place as a whole is pretty big so you definitely need to on your A game especially when big blockbuster movies come out. This job is aimed for younger people with fresh faces. Overall it’s a fun great place to work
good,I enjoyed the experience I gained when I worked at Regal Cinemas. I learned many skills. I loved that the floor staff and managers were friendly and welcoming to anyone and everyone.
good,"A great job for someone who is in school or still considering his/her options. Flexible hours, great workplace culture, and opportunities to advance. However, the part-time nature means no benefits and low pay."
good,"This job was fun to work at, with many oportunities to meet new people. For those who enjoy watching movies, the free movies were a great and welcomed benefit"
good,"My location's managers were in their 20s so the environment was very chill and laid back. I was a box office cashier for two years and when it wasn't busy, they just had us clean glasses. Very flexible scheduling, only need to give a week notice if you want specific days off. Overall was a great first job for me, made some life long friends with my coworkers and even though I don't work there anymore, I still visit every once in a while because the people there are just that great."
good,"Regal is a great place to work. The environment is very steady and laid back. The culture is very welcoming and friendly. Everyone seeks to help each other out and sees each other as equals. On weekends, business tends to be busy and can be daunting at times, but Regal supplies the best employees who are able to overcome these busy days at work.  The only cons that can be said is that Regal tends to be very understaffed which can make working on busy days stressful."
good,"Fast paced, organized, shifts that accommodate life balance, and a wonderful option for a first job. Teaches handling money, adaptability, and multitasking."
good,If you like to move quick this is the job for you. Everyday is something different. Weekends are busy but that comes with the title. Management is great once you get to know them. Great first job I have been there for close to 11 years and have moved up in the company quickly.
good,"High paced job, Standing at least 8 hours a day.  Must own high quality guest service, due to the hundreds of people coming in everyday.  If you do NOT like people I would not suggest this job to you!"
good,"It is constantly busy during rush ours, whether you are concession or usher or a ticket seller. They are very flexible since they have a large staff and the benefits are great. Although it is really hard work on busy days, it is not bad overall. Good environment and coworkers are fun. Managment is also very helpful."
good,There are strict clothing and physical looks requirements. Learning how to work behind the concessions counter was pretty easy but stressful because Regal is such a busy place. There is no time to stop. Always with the next customer. There are strict policies to follow about up-selling to every single customer and promoting every single special deal. If you do not do these things they will deduct points from a point system.
good,The job was great for a first time job and loved the benefits of getting to see free movies and being able to bring friends. Management at the time was really great and friendly
good,"comfortable being in a large group"
good,"The work environment was great! From the coworkers, employees, and other staff members, I enjoyed working with them all. I also enjoyed the perks of free movies for myself. I was a college student at the time, so being able to watch free movies and enjoy time at work with good people was a nice change from the stresses of college. As an assistant manager I had quite a bit of responsibility but nothing that a person can't handle. There were always opportunities for advancement in job positions, which is always a great way to learn more and get payed more!"
good,A great atmosphere to learn to work at fast past. Friendly employees. The hours where pretty long and it was difficult to have a life beyond work. Although they gave plenty of opportunities to advance within the company.
good,"Can be stressful at time, but overall great environment to work in, awesome and friendly management crew. Managers are very nice and will work with you as long as you work with them. Great opportunity to meet nice and awesome people including celebrities."
good,The life at the theatre was nice but they just didnt pay much. benefits were great. the management was alright. i left because some of the new management was rude.
good,Its was unnecessarily the co-workers but more on the job rules being too intense. I liked three of my managers including my GM. The coworkers were almost very pleasant to work with and it was nice as my first job to get some type of working experience especially as a cashier.
good,Floor staff is a good starting point for teenagers.  The job is easy.  Management was flexible and worked with employees.
good,"I loved my co-workers, and the managers were nice. They loved to hear good news about school, and they always wanted to help."
good,"A typical day depends on what area you are scheduled to work in. During the school year a typical week day is slow up until around 7pm. During school breaks, everyday of the week can busy from early afternoon to last movie showing. Management expect a lot from you but they are very friendly and try their best to keep the days as fun and light as possible. Co-workers are all very nice, helpful and supportive. The hardest part is concession closings during opening weekends, shows can be added up to 2am and you won't make it home until 3:30a almost 4am. Most enjoyable is the people that work there."
good,"when i'm focus on my task and work hard everyday without being distracted. i maintain my self calm and collective at all times even if i'm mad at someone or if some is someone is bragging bout how much they hate their job. i love to learn new things everyday even if it takes time. i always get along with everyone in the work place, i never had a problem with no one or never had a fight with someone at work.The hardest part of a job is when a manager gets rude to someone and they are being polite to them. the enjoyable part of a job is when u come to work on time,be focus and work hard."
good,"I started here when i was 16 years old. This was my most favorite places to work at. I loved working with the people and the most of the managers. At the beginning, they weren't giving people the proper raises they were entitled too, but after awhile that issue got resolved I've done everything there from cleaning to serving people."
good,i learned how to manage a team work with a team become a leader the laid back enviroment was perfect for my first job and management was very good a recognizing talent and work ethic and promoting as such and they valued there assets within the organization
good,"Loved my location, great people to work with. Industry is a personal hobby!"
good,Is a nice first job you can work. Very suitable place for a teenager to work in or part time college student.
good,Regal is a very responsible company when dealing with making sure that everyone feels welcomed and comfortable to know that they handle each problem and or issue efficiently and effectively as possible. They also always have a way to make anything that they selling that institution a cheaper value. Each customer is put first and handled with respect and proper care.
good,"I loved working at Regal, but when certain employees do not pull their eight your job may become harder. the benefits are good, they provide two free movie tickets a week, and 50% off the concession food."
good,Great high school and college job.One of the most fun part time jobs to have. Free movies and great people to talk to and watch movies with. Get to see awesome early release movies.
good,This was my first job and it was a great step into the working field. They had flexible hours and everything was simple enough for me to catch on fairly quickly. I learned how to be more open and trust in my fellow co-workers. The management was great and i knew i could lean on them for support when i needed to. It was a competitive workplace but we were all supportive of each other. The hardest part of the job was the manual labor but we had great teamwork so time flew by really quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with such an amazing team of workers that knew how to support each other.
good,"It was a great summer job with few hard days. Managers nice, coworkers easy to get along with, job fulfilling. Weird hours at time, and big releases are quite hectic, but should be expected when working at a movie theater."
good,"Not an easy job, but well worth it for what you can receive. Free tickets (2 per movie) and 50% off concessions was worth it. Got to see a lot of movies and even had chances to see pre-showings at work! Had fun staff and great management. Still love to visit."
good,"My first and only job for 3 1/2 years due to my enjoyment of the work environment there. Friendly staff, Friendlier management, an easygoing stress free workplace, and an overall unforgettable experience."
good,"Easy job, sometimes quick paced when a new movie came out. Fun job overall. Hardest part about working here was the customers because they were usually drunk. But besides that real good job, i miss it."
good,A typical day at work was usually a morning-evening shift and I would work on helping the customer be provided the best service for the entertainment they would watch.
good,"Your job is to run the theater and all that comes with that. The rules and regulations are only as serious as the manager on duty, which is with every position. It's all a question of how big of an area your theater caters too."
good,"Regal is a really good company to work for if you are just starting out in the workforce. The schedule is flexible, the staff is very friendly, the work is easy, as long as you follow the training. The only down sides to working at Regal is they never close, so you may end up working holidays, such as Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Easter. You only get time and a half on 4 holidays out of the year. You also have to be mentally prepared to deal with nasty people on occasion, but this is the case with every retail job you work for. Customer service skills are a must. It is a good job to look into if you are interested in moving up the chain."
good,Working for the Regal was a great experience. It was a friendly and helpful environment to get started. I learned to count faster and have more confidence in my voice.
good,"overall great environment"
good,Customers can be difficult but overall a  good job. Great benefits for full time. Unfortunately open and very busy for all holidays. Required to work.
good,This isn't one of those jobs that you get and can sit around on your phone or doing homework all day. Some serious effort needs to be put in because Regal is the real deal. It comes with great benefits though like free movies and half off concessions. Full-Time benefits are more serious but I am not full time so I can't comment on those.
good,"Welcoming customers, suggesting concession items, up selling concession items, preping food, direct customers to their auditorium, thank them and enjoy your day."
good,"I absolutely loved working here! I learned many things working here, Management were great, friendly people. My co-workers was one of the best parts working here, I loved working with every single one of them. One of the hardest parts of the job I would say is sometimes we would be understaffed and have a whole lot of customers come in and try and get everybody through concessions quickly as possible and into their movies. I would say the best part of the job is to get to watch free movies on your off days."
good,I am very easy to get along with and that really helps in the work place because when you can enjoy working with people it makes going to work that much better.
good,Regal Entertainment Group is a great job to Start while in high school or college they are very flexible they also have great management.
good,Regal was always fast paced and I was able to use that knowledge along with the training provided to me through the company and my managers to become a manager myself at another theatre.
good,"Regal Cinemas is a wonderful company with great benefits, pay, hours and advancement opportunities. At the lower levels employees are paid well for the work they are asked to do. There is opportunity for benefits and advancement. Employees are trained well and monitored for improvement or praise opportunities."
good,"fun at work,get to meet alot of new ppl"
good,"I started as an usher and moved my way into management within a year.  It was my second job, but it was the most fun I've had at a job.   It was laid back but everyone got serious when we got busy.  The team chemistry was outstanding.  Management was fantastic, to this day I miss my old GM and DM.    "
good,"Fun place to work. Easy to get along with work mates and management. Mostly have to work in the evenings. Business comes in spurts, Gets really busy for a couple of hours then you will have some down time before it gets busy again. Great job if you are in school."
good,Regal is a fast paced environment full of challenging circumstances that provide you with plenty of experience for later on in life. Having worked multiple positions in the company I can safely say that it is a fun and worthwhile place to work.
good,The hardest part of the job would be accommodating unsatisfied customers on a daily basis.
good,Very well kept facility theaters are kept clean throughout day/ Learn how to use register and calculate invoices. Management was laid back and customer friendly. The thing I enjoyed the most about working for Regal Cinemas was being able to watch movies for free!
good,I very enjoy working at regal. It's  a fast pace working place. You always working none stop for the whole 8 hours. You unload and load the containers the hole shift. We have to use hand pallet Jack's to move the product after we wrap them up.
good,"This job was always one of my favorites. The discounts & 2 free movie tickets a day! The only reason why I gave it a 4star review is because, when it gets too slow in between the movies they'll send you home. The earliest I've been sent home was 2 hours into my shift. This job is perfect for a HS/College student who need some extra cash. Not so much for a person who has Bills and kids lol! Our manager was very professional, understanding, and was very kind !  Aswell as my co workers , they were truly the best part about working there."
good,"make popcorn."
good,"Enjoy working here, great area for business and tourist, staff and customers keep every day uplifting and interesting with never a dull moment. It's more than just being a movie theater it's building a brand and business."
good,"Many would think working at a movie theater is busy, numb and time-consuming work. Surprisingly, working for Regal Entertainment Group was very fun and easy-going. An employee begins to feel like they are opening up a world of joy and excitement for each customer they assist. The theater itself is a place of almost enchantment. Once you get a hang of what your job-description entails, time will FLY by. The tasks include directing patrons to their theater, cleaning theaters after the movie ends, and selling food goods to customers."
good,"Hard labor , cleaning  theaters , co workers very supportive and helpful."
good,I was able to learn the how to be a in management. I able help the youth and show them how to work for advancement. 
good,"I did not have any opportunity to advance they played favorites and didnt listen or care for anything else it was more of a hangout for the managers and the ""favorite"" employees and if you weren't a favorite you got stuck with a night shifts till 2am."
good,Making sure your always on point with maintaining cleanliness of the gym. about halfway through the shift you go on break and work till the end of your shift.
good,"It is a factory and sometimes you would work long hours. The people "
good,I've learned so much from computers to customer service and working with lots of employees and watching lots of movies hardest part of job is when super blockbuster movies came out and having thousands of customers.
good,For the most part it’s a good place to work if you’re in high school. They work with your schedule but are always looking for people to close. Closing concessions is the worst part of the job.
good,"Hard Work and muscle come in handy. Adjustable as I became pregnant while working there. Had to quit because they do not offer Maternity Leave to anyone who doesn't work for at least 12 months with them. Other than that, I would still want to be working for them."
good,"fun place to work, no benefits but you get free movies, popcorn and drinks. that in itself will make you never want to quit. the staff are fun to be around, its a good and fun time"
good,I like working her but you don’t get enough hours. I like the free movies and half price in  Concession. The customer or ok most of time. There no holidays off unless to request off. It’s ok for extra money.
good,"Very good place to learn management and inventory. Will build customer relation extensively. room for advancement if patient, benefits only for full time."
good,Working at Regal was a great experience. Everybody was nice most of the time. Some of the managers were really nice and understanding. I started building my cashier and customer service skills here.
good,"I loved working here. It was fast-paced and time flied. However, management seemed to give promotions to those they favored rather than actual skill set. You get half off on food and free drinks/popcorn when you're on the clock."
good,I love the people and the enviroment. Its a customer service based job. The interaction with the customers are amazing.
good,"It was a nice place to work at but some of the people their was shown favoritism. I worked hard for everything and I ran concession, box office and I also was an usher. the worker was nice and everyone got along. the hardest part of the job was inventory. the most enjoyable part of the job was talking with customers everyday."
good,Personally for me this was a first time job which I absolutley loved!  It was a good first time job that game me alot of knowldge on the real working world and also gave me this experience I needed to excel in other professions of my interest.
good,"I have no problems working at Regal, I just don't get enough hours. The rushes for different movies can sometimes be unbearable, but overall the management team is very lenient."
good,It was a good company to work for but in the end when I pointed out their mistakes they looked for ways to make me want to quit. A typical day at work was always about making sure the customer was always happy
good,"Great work culture.  "
good,At the Regal Entertainment Group location where I was employed the work load was divided evenly and fairly. Box office was responsible for keeping their own work spaces clean. The Concession Stand responsibilities were divided based on the amount and experience of individuals working that shift.
good,Staff was friendly and Management was was great I loved how it was ran working there was one of the best jobs I had pay was good hours were great all around a great work environment
good,The regal was an okay place to work at but it was only a seasonal job due to the holidays but overall it was a very chill work place and I made a few good memories there.
good,Easy to.learn and succeed. Only problem I had was with the manager at the time who refused to pay attention to my availability. I had 2 jobs and he consistently scheduled me at times when I specifically said I couldn't work
good,Working with regal was a great opportunity. The other workers were really nice and fun to work with. I just felt like i would work all week and my paycheck wouldn’t be enough to stretch until my next paycheck.
good,"Great team to work with, very helpful and offering. Management is very flexible with hours and if certain situations come up, or flexible with requested time off."
good,"The work was simple but engaging enough to keep everyone working all shift. Busy days and slow days did not change much how the overall work flow felt. People were easy to interact with and managers were excellent with dealing with employee squabbles and customer concerns. The most difficult part was the gaps in some busy days where no one would come in and employees would be left to their own devices somewhat to find something to do, which some weekends made for a few boring hours after a rush."
good,Regal was a fun experience I enjoyed working around the movie theater I was in charge of cleaning the movie theaters and I enjoyed the free movie tickets they offered.
good,"No room for advancement in this company. They’re always changing management and the way they run operations. Corporate is always making the theatre operations decisions not the individual theatres. "
good,It is a really face paced environment. It can get stressful from time to time but it should be expected when applying for the job. Overall its a good place to work.
good,"Worked concession stand, maintenance and ticket counter. Concession stand consisted of preparing food such as popcorn, hot dogs, nachos, etc. Maintenance was cleaning movie theater after use"
good,a typical day was fun you have your rush hours and down time everyone usually enjoys their job and has fun while performing our daily duties and customers are often friendly
good,"i was a floor leader which mean i was checking theather making sure everything was okay, i also was a cashier, and a ticket door member, i was collecting tickets checking bags for weapons"
good,It was the greatest job. The management was very kind and understanding that we all have public lives. My co-workers were supportive of my goals and more.
good,i really enjoyed working at Regal Cinema. I absolutely enjoy movies and the free perk of working there was receiving free movie tickets and it was great.
good,Enjoyed volunteering helping a good cause. Going to different locations and spreading the cause and the story behind our fundraiser. It was also fun to do
good,"Theres lots of opportunity for advancement if you wish. Great company to work for. Nights, weekends and holiday job. It can be whatever you make of it."
good,Typical days at work are pretty chill. Weekends are the most busiest days of the week unless there is a big movie out. I learned how to deal with certain people on a daily basis. Everyone in management are all good people. The hardest part of the job was when a new big movie was releasing. The most enjoying part of the job was seeing customers with smiles on their face.
good,"A typical workday at regal entertainment groups requires patience and organization. I am either selling selling tickets or working in their concession stand. No matter where I am working, I am on time and do my best to please the costumer at hand."
good,A typical day requires cleaning and providing excellent customer service. I learned to relate to diverse groups of people as well as advanced cleaning
good,Loved being there! they worked with school schedules and gave you as many hours as possible. Honestly my favorite job! I would definitely refer anyone to work there.
good,"This was one of my favorite places to work especially while in school, they are great at working with you no matter the circumstance. i highly recommend"
good,"Regal cinemas is a great company. They are all so friendly, funny, and most importantly hard working. If you're a people person, love to work as a team and have fun, this is most likely the place for you."
good,Great first job. really taught work ethic and customer service. met tons of cool people I still keep in touch with. made enough money to buy first car!
good,"I loved where I worked at , being placed there was awesome working with kids . Great environment pays well I definitely recommend getting a job with cny .?"
good,"It all depends when you work; during the week is very slow and no one really comes in but, during the weekend its very fast paced and busy. The hardest part of the job is staying calm while a customer is yelling at you and cursing at you but other than that the job is very easy."
good,My first job experience and it was a great one. I learned a lot about customer service and multi tasking. great place to work
good,"Having worked here for a year and a half, I was introduced to a fast paced workplace. The timing of the tasks are crucial to the integrity of the establishment. Management was always the wind behind my wings! Everyone was friendly and eager to talk about many things. The hardest part of the job for me was leaving! The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to guests about films!"
good,"All employees are easily accessible and very helpful. The waves of people come and go, so you need to stay on top of things. My job includes sweeping, taking out trash, and checking the bathrooms."
good,"Regal is an amazing company to work for all thanks to the employee atmosphere, your coworkers really do become your close friends. It is actually fun to go to work!"
good,Fast paced and fun place to work.  Teaches great skills to further your career.  Hardest part of the job was handling difficult customers being upset over the high prices.
good,"I love working for REG. i've been working there since i've been legally allowed and it has been a blast. the management is nice and easy to get along with. all the staff is mostly college kids because of our location, so everyone is nice."
good,"Regal was a great first job, and made me feel at home from day one. The coworkers were polite, management was respectful, and it was overall a happy and fun work environment."
good,"Regal Cinemas is a great place to be employed. The employees are fun to be around and management is pretty easy going. Typical days are pretty smooth. During the week, it can be slow, especially during the school year, so there isn't much to do. During the summer, holidays, and weekends, it can get pretty busy."
good,"During my time with Regal I have served many customers from behind concessions, where I've refined my customer service, and upstairs in the projection room, where I developed my technician skills."
good,"The days started slower around 11am, but brought busier crowds as the day progressed. Management is helpful and enthusiastic."
good,Great customer service was a very important part of the job . I learned a lot about customer service while employed by Regal . I absolutely loved my managers great people to work with. There wasn't really a hard part about the job but I enjoyed taking care of our customers.
good,"I worked at the theater for 11 years and it was some of the most fun I've ever had.  I started out as part of the floor staff, box office, concessions and usher, and moved my way up to manager.  The people were a blast to work with and I learned so much about customer service and film.The best part of the job, back in the mid 2000's, was learning to thread the projectors, unlike now-a-days, where everything is digital."
good,I enjoyed working for Regal. I started at entry level and worked up to Assistant General Manager. I've learned just about everything to run the building and was even sent to a week long corporate training seminar. Regal is a great company going through so changes and I would like to add to my managerial and work experience.
good,Management goes above and beyond to help customers. Customers are always happy when there is issue because it gets resolved as soon as possible with a smile.
good,I enjoyed working there. The hours were flexible and the staff were friendly and fun to get along with. I am a huge movie buff and this was an ideal job.
good,"Regal is a good company to work for. I have learned a lot about responsibility and customer service. This job has taught me how to deal with stressful situations in a timely manner. I have learned to be efficient and have learned to work as a team by working together to accomplish goals such as raising money for charity or even everyday task like getting the line down as quickly as possible. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction I get to have with guest. I also enjoy the work environment, as my fellow coworkers are fun to work with."
good,"First job at 16 years old, seasonal employment only worked during the summer when school was out. Worked as a customer service associate for moviegoers"
good,"Such a great job to work at through out high school and into college. Everyone is such team players, and the managers are all awesome, interesting people."
good,The day to day work was fun and effective. I learned a lot about handling money and helping guest. My co workers were great as well as most of the management.
good,"I learned that everything is done with the help of a team."
good,"it was okay, no more no less . there  management was barely decent , staff had a lot of drama but i never fell into it . the breaks were to short to me , people made a lot of complaints just to have each other in trouble but we had the select few staff members including me ,that kept a level head"
good,"great people"
good,Throughout the entire work I performed at this theatre we had many competitive and fun activities to provide the employees with a feeling of accomplishment through sales at the concession stand. As well as being able to provide the public with an exciting atmosphere.
good,There is always something to do and something to be learned. The work is easy on a person as the company strives to encourage teamwork.
good,"I just loved working at the movie theater, meeting new people. the staff were great to me. Also the managers and boss were great to me. whenever i need it something they came along"
good,"As a employee at Regal Cinema I often worked in the concession stand handling cash and cards and preparing food, I also worked in the ticket area giving out tickets for any movie the customer wanted to watch."
good,Such company is one of the good company to work for if you are a student in need of income while furthering your education.
good,Regal theaters was my first job. It amounted to a basic janitorial job. I expected that. I did expect the amount of feces that is smeared across the walls and halls of your average theater. The best part of the job was getting to see all the summer blockbusters for free.
good,"A typical day at Regal, would consist of many tasks that would had to be done by a certain time, and helping out guests. During my time at Regal I have learned numerously skills. I learned good customer service skills, how to answer the phone in a professional manner, dealing with variety of individuals, and entering in data regarding the rewards card. Management was always helpful in trying to make events run smooth. The Co-workers were respectful and caring. The hardest part of the job would be when there were certain days were it would be busy and guests would not be as understanding, but working there you learned to let it go and tried to make the best of the situation. The most enjoyable part of the job would be seeing the co-workers and the guests be happy."
good,"Working with Regal Entertainment Group was a good experience for a first job. Starting with them in high school and working with them all throughout my college career, a typical day had me working closely with customers, dealing with large amounts of money, and keeping track of inventory during my shift. I worked as a team with my managers and coworkers to ensure that the theater was running smoothly in all areas including box office, concession, and the theaters themselves. We also worked hard to ensure that our customers always had a great experience, and if not, did whatever we could to resolve any issues that they might of had as soon as possible."
good,I would go in and clean theaters. The managers were very good bosses.
good,"The supervisors were very informative. The co-workers were very easy going and every one pulls their own weight of work. On busy days it gets really crazy, but busy depending on the movies."
good,had fun working there very friendly very good working place and very good environment for all
good,Gives young adults the experience for future jobs. Sets a standard and wok ethic to carry to future positions
good,I love this job. I look forward to going to work everyday. The workers and managers are very polite and constructive criticism is used.
good,i would make popcorn and clean theaters i learned to be patient and i loved seeing movies
good,It was a wonderful experience. The customers and my line of work is what kept me going each day.
good,"My time at the theater will never be forgotten. "
good,"A typical day at work would be that I assist customers to their designated theaters. I cleaned the theaters, bathrooms, hallways and lobby area. I operated a cash register in the concession stands as well as other functions according to FDA and OSHA guidelines and regulations. The management were very organized and fun to work with. The co workers were very team work oriented. The hardest part for me was having to stand constantly all day having back pain. The most enjoyable part of my job was that I not only got to meet new people everyday but I  got to watch any and all movies I wanted while I wasn't at work or clocked in to work."
good,"Working at Regal was a very fun experience for me. It gave me the confidence to help others that I have never met before. When I was working at Regal, I never felt more connected to a group of people that I was happy to call ""Work Family""."
good,"Working here was like not working at all, one of the morst family orientied work places Ive ever had the enjoyment of being in. What I learned while working here is teamwork. Coworkers all got along, and worked well together, and management was right on board."
good,"A normal day at work consists of either selling tickets, concessions items, or cleaning up auditoriums. My co-workers are some of the best people I've ever met. I learned plenty from this job including how to be much more sociable."
good,It was a great job. I couldnt have worked for a better company.
good,"Helping customers with snacks and tickets, directing them to their theater, multi-tasking.  Cleaning work areas and keeping bathrooms and theaters presentable."
good,Fun place to work. You know when it will be slow and when it will be fast paced. 
good,Cleaning. I learn how it is working with the movie industry. They were very nice people. Very nice to me. Working in the con-section stand and box office. Getting to watch a free movie with my family!!!!! 
good,This was an excellent place to work. It was fun and upbeat and it was great to see free movies.
good,Working here was a great experience. Enteractions with guests were always short due to how busy it always was.
good,Best job ever!! free popcorn/soda/movies...while working...only downside is having to clean up after people
good,"A typical day at work included cleaning theaters after showings ended. Pretty basic days. I learned how to work in large groups and clean up at a fast pace in a short amount of time. Management was easy to work with and very helpful. Co-works were also easy to work with and fun to be around in and outside of work, The hardest part of the job would be when we were short staffed and had less people to clean up theaters, especially during big openings and/or weekends. The most enjoyable part of the job was working fast to help with the day ending quick."
good,prepared and served concession items to guests
good,"A typical day of work here would involve answering customer questions about movies, being on a register, handling money, and lots of cleaning. I've learned a lot about projection and the entertainment industry itself. The management here was always very friendly and helpful. Not just to the employees, but to the customers as well, where it matters the most. They were always real prompt and quick to resolve any issues I had with scheduling or other employees, or whatever the issue may be. It could get sort of overwhelming sometimes, especially on the weekends, when a lot of movies would end at the same time. It would get very tiring constantly running from one end of the building to the other, trying to rush and clean up the theaters, to prepare them for the next showing. I think the most enjoyable part of this job, would be staying up to date on which movies were out or were coming out, and learning about the different plots."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my experince here, I was responsible for a multiple of duties which I enjoyed! This job get's you prepared for any work environment with it's variety of fields and multi tascle activities."
good,This was a very fun job that had allowed you to interact with many different people and be involved with all the upcoming movies. My daily activities were to make sure the theater operations would successfully run smoothly. The hardest part was to do this efficiently and effectively.
good,"I start my day at work with cleaning and starting up most of the machinery, help counting money and take care of customer needs. I learned that no matter what position you are put to work working fast paced and taking care of what the customer wants are two of the most inportant things. The five rules I have been taught are greeting the customer, upselling, suggestive selling, asking for the Regal Crown Club Card and then thanking the guest with a reply of ""enjoy your show"" with a smile on my face at all times. My coworkers are all amazing people and have all taught me a great deal in life and have also taught me different techniques for cleaning and working an even faster pace. The hardest part of my job is taking care of all positions at once when we are low in staff, which i am capable of taking care of. The thing i enjoy most about my job is making sure the customer and all my coworkers all leave at the end of the day with a smile on their faces because thats how i know i did my job well done."
good,"Some of the best management that I have had the pleasure of working with. Free movies, and some popcorn, not bad for a min wage job, decent amount of upward hireing. Not enough hours."
good,I greeted patrons while checking their tickets and guiding them to their proper theater rooms
good,"watched movies, cleaned and cooked. Worked in the ticket booth."
good,This was a fun place to work. i meet a lot of creative people here and there was always some project to keep me busy.
good,It was a pretty chill place work. Make sure you know what days you work. Had to move up in the company. Make sure to always come to work in uniform. I liked my job😊
good,"This is fairly an okay job . The skills that are needed are real simple but then again dealing with customers may be the most difficult part , not because of you but because of how they respond . I love the people and enjoy the job environment when I am here everyone keeps it strictly business for the most part and I like that . Our management could be a little better but right now for the most part its good ."
good,Regal Cinema was a fun group to work for. They have a friendly atmosphere and offer as much help as they can give. It can get a little crazy when big movies comes out but that just means more hours for everyone.
good,"That being said the company has changed alot with recent merger with cineworld. employees felt although they weren't appreciated. and it became increasingly harder from a management position to jump through the hoops expected of us from our regional management. (payroll, maitenence, budget cuts, and extreme focus on cleanliness with no plan to encourage employees to do a sufficient job. "
good,Regal was a great job I loved working for them just when a better job came along I took it but I loved everything about regal the movies the job the customers the cross training I miss working in the movie industry to be honest it's amazing
good,Regal theaters can be fun to work at but I have found that the company is often stingy when it comes to hours and pay raises. It can also become difficult when working with teenagers who just don't care about their jobs.
good,A typical day at work isn't very difficult. The assistant managers are all awesome. The GM at our location is horrible. The work itself is easy and nothing is to difficult to accomplish.
good,"Regal Grand Parkway is very busy most days in the afternoon. I learned to be very quick when serving customers, to be positive and respect others opinions. The management was very conductive and kept people in check and there were supervisors always on scene. There were uniforms to be worn properly and hair needs to be tied up and always approach a customer with a smile. The only thin i enjoyed about my job is being busy all the time so i would never be idle."
good,"It is some what fast paced, dependent upon fluctuating business. A great management team will lead to a good work environment as well as a worry free day. Most difficult part I would have to say is learning how to clean the frozen yogurt machine and having to do that every other day. Other than that the atmosphere coincides with how a cast members day can turn out, which can be super mega busy because of a new movie premiere or to slow AM's and keeping the area tidy. Over all a good place to start off if interested in a fun interacting job."
good,Fun job - free movies. New friends. A lot of cleaning and sometimes nasty. Hours long on the weekend. Can be stressful with long lines at the concession.
good,"This was my first job, and it was a super fun enviornment. It's made for younger kids with no experience, and it provides some good training! It never got boring, I used to work the concession and box office. It got a little stressful when new movies would come out, but if you're like me then you enjoy the rush and just try to clear it out as quick as possible!"
good,"Management is nice! Coworkers are all upbeat and free movies are a plus.  Only bad thing is cleaning the popper at night, that can be a real task. Shifts get busy so be ready to serve a hundred plus on a busy night."
good,"Most of the managers were more than willing to help answer questions should the need arise. I learned about managing money and, most importantly, time management. The most enjoyable part of the job was the coworkers if you were an usher."
good,My job title was an Usher which consisted of me cleaning the theaters. I learned customer service skills and minor cashier experience. I liked the environment and the free movies was a plus. The only thing lacking was the professionalism of the management (immaturity) as well as a lack of advancement to a higher paying position. I worked there for over a year and only received a 13 cent raise.
good,"When not busy, you need to be constantly cleaning. Management is hit or miss, some were very great and others shouldn't be managers at all. The environment is fun and fast."
good,"Regal was a good company to work for. The only problem I had was harrassment by certain Manager who chose favorites and was unfair to some people but other than that, the GM was great and a great company."
good,"Fix food and serve customers. It's fun to interact with customers and stays pretty busy. Good job, but doesn't pay enough and not for long term."
good,"Chaos and Calm. "
good,It was a good experience to interact with customers on a daily basis. I enjoyed the co-workers and the managers.
good,It is by far the greatest first job anyone can have. I fully enjoyed working there. The management is friendly and great to work for.
good,"I love the movie theatre business, but it was always late nights and always the opposite schedule as my family so I never got to see any of them"
good,"I typically would arrive to work give a particular assignment and then I would go to that area, like the box office and just sell tickets. Management was always around to help, as well as give good feed back on the days sells and progress. The coworkers were always fun and made the day go by quicker."
good,"Wonderful people and good hours, to be efficient and exact when working with money"
good,"Customer service is number one at regal. This can often be a disservice to employees as they aren’t treated the best. Either way, it’s a great job to have in order to overcome problems and get out of your comfort zone."
good,The pay is horrible! It’s minimum wages until you become manager. They do not give you raises ; no matter how long you’ve been working for them. The work place all together is fun and very easy job!
good,"This is definitely a good starting job. I’ve worked here for over a year and it’s always been relatively pleasant. I haven’t had any problems with management, and they typically give you your requested days off as long as it’s two weeks in advance. Plus two free tickets a week!"
good,Overall a very good high school job unless you are higher up in the company. Good flexible hours and they are very good at working around your schedule or special needs if requested.
good,"Regal is a great place to start as a first job. All the managers are caring and understanding when school and life happens. You learn new things every day with the managers like how to handle certain situations or how to up-sell a new product. Though weekends become very fast-paced, there is always someone around to lend a hand when needed."
good,"Like most of the staff and that makes the job worth while. It's like a second family."
good,What I truly admired about working here was how well the management treated everyone. Especially as a coworker it was great to have managers that were consistently on top of anything that needed to be fixed. Always nice and when workdays were slow always gave us extended breaks.
good,Really enjoyed my time at regal learned a lot of necessary customer service skill and enjoyed the tutelage of my managers who were always there to lend a helping hand
good,Regal is a great place for a starter job. Employees are friendly and all work together to get their jobs done. The job tasks are not difficult as long as you follow the rules and meet your goal. Can get busy at times depending on your region/time of year/ movie releases but the busy shifts go by the fastest.
good,"Regal Cinemas is a great environment, it’s fast paced & active. The employees know what they’re talking about. They know the products well which helps then  assist you faster. Overall t is a great environment."
good,It's a good job to work at.  Good management.  The typical day at work consists of customer service and making sure that the theater is in good working standard.
good,This is a good job for students or retired persons.  It is fun atmosphere.  Management is great and team mates are fun.  Customers are great!  Birthday Party Planner role was fun and rewarding.  I also enjoyed previewing new movies and giving rating feedback.
good,"A typical day would include set up and task for the day. I learned to cope when it came to stressful situations and to correct situations. Management was good and helpful. The workplace is either quiet or busy but pleasant. The hardest part of the job is working out your mistakes if you occur any. the most enjoyable time you will get is either, helping a customer, talking to your managers or co workers, going on lunch or going home, knowing you put in a hard day of work at work, and looking forward to another fun day at work!"
good,"I have been working for Regal over 15 years and I love it!  The people are great and the company and wage is fair."
good,spending about 4 to 5 hours a night cleaning I enjoyed it because its easy work plus I enjoy working with others. a regular day at work consist of joking hard working and ends with relief. its real a basic job and I can adapt easily so there was no hard parts once I learned the routine.
good,I love the theatre business - it's diversity and excitement.  You get to meet people from all walks of life and interact with anyone.  You never know who might walk in the door.  Never a dull moment!  The only downside is the pay - theatres just don't pay.
good,"Working at the theater has been one of the best work experiences I have ever had. Managers here have taught me a great deal of how to provide great customer service through their reactions to many different situations."
good,Looking to improve management skills and customer service skills Regal is a great place to start that journey. I enjoy getting this amazing experience
good,"Management was young, approachable, and lenient. Standing for extended periods of time is the hardest part of the job. Job perks were outstanding."
good,"Pretty normal work day at a Movie Theater. Regular day to day ""rush"". "
good,"Started as a floor associate, Worked my way up to assistant manager. Enjoyed the job never missed one day of work. Had the chance to manage 20 employees, learned a lot about running a business."
good,"The environment, the staff, and the customers make it a lively place to work. Every day is different, and the benefits are pretty cool."
good,"Had a chance to work as management, training, and computer help desk. Managed at two locations, trained and certified an entire region, and did technical support for entire company."
good,"when i volunteered there during high school, it was a blast meet a lot of nice people. i wish i could have stayed but i moved away."
good,It is a place where I get along with my coworkers and the managers. It some times is a bit stressful. It would be nice to have health benefits but they do not.
good,"Overall I enjoyed working at Regal Cinemas, and being able to get into movies for free, the management there were very welcoming and I enjoyed coming to work most days! It was an overall great experience, and I wouldn't mind working there again."
good,It help me understand of how certain historical objects are kept or not kept due to the primary and/or secondary sources definition.
good,"A typical day would all depend on what job i was doing. If i was working usher i would be cleaning bathrooms, theater and lobby. If I was at door I was talking to customers making sure they were not trying to see a rated R movie if there were under 17. Last but not least if I was working consession i was dealing with customers and handling food."
good,"- Start off a day with opening and getting the theater open and ready for business, cleaning and prepping our stations. Greeting and giving great customer service to all guests and keeping busy until the day is done. "
good,Team work and good customer service  cleaning and maintainning fast pace 
good,it was my funnest job i had.i had lots of fun i like the atmosphere it made me feel very good.
good,"I had fun working at regal in the beginning .employees would be able to have 2 free tickets a day as many times a week as you’d like. Towards the end of my time working at regal, management had changed so employees could only get 2 tickets per week. I also felt like I was getting payed way less than I deserved"
good,"Fun environment , open 365 days a year.  Hard to get time off for vacations.   Holidays you work them all.  I loved the job and stayed for a long time.  Would work there again ."
good,"I was in the concession area primarily, so I would serve food, clean the concession area, and make financial transactions at the cash register. It was slow during the week and fast paced on the weekends. I learned to multitask, balance, superior customer service, and patience. The management was great and very understanding. The workplace culture was excellent, I loved working there. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the concession area after a busy day, and the most enjoyable part of the job was being cross-trained in ticket sales and being an usher."
good,"Associate Manager "
good,"Really loved all the staff members, the actual working part wasn’t too bad until the days it got really busy when popular movies would come out, a lot of cleaning, overall pretty good experience"
good,"Fun place to  work. All staff, managers and supervisors were fun and easy  to work with with no problems with communication and working as a team. I would of never left but i needed and was promised  more hour at Paintbrush."
good,Working at regal is easy for the most part the people you work with make a huge difference same with the management as well a good experience overall though it can get really busy
good,"Fun place to work everyone is nice and it’s in the middle of everything , great experiences they just don’t allow hair color or visible tattoos overall great place to work"
good,Love working there with different job positions and free movies when off and enjoyed working with the employee s and managers.  The food was good as well.
good,"The best part of the job was working in the box office , I was able to enjoy my job. The managers had very Great attitudes and taught me how to do my job better. The culture was very fast on the weekends and slow paced during the weekdays. A normal day at work consisted of me selling and ripping tickets. I learned how to actually have customer service and use it to the best of my ability."
good,I learned how to work their cash register. All other duties I had I already had prior experience. There is not any duties from regal that are very difficult.
good,"I love my crew, I love management, I love everything about it but the pay. It’s definitely a high school/college job and not recommended for adults that need to pay for rent and insurance. Your hours and the stress depends on the day and what movies are out so it’s not steady at all. You get 2 free tickets and up to 8 items discounted (50%) a day. It starts you off at minimum wage and you get tiny raises here and there."
good,Working at Regal was a blast. I met a lot of nice people and gained a lot of new experiences since that was my first movie job.The experience was good as well as the management team.
good,I loved working for Regal. Their rules weren't to intensive but they made a safer work environment. The benefits also made working there worth it. I would gladly work for another Regal employer.
good,The teams assembled by the Regal managers work well together. There is no conflict between employees and managers. The employees are very friendly to newcomers and make sure everyone feels welcomed and productive.
good,"It's a great first job, if you like the people you work with, the days go by quickly. The free movies are always a plus, but the rushes for certain movies can be very intense if the team doesn't work well together. It's generally very relaxed and enjoyable though."
good,I liked to work there but it was some tough days I had but its a nice hard working place but its friendly. The days i worked there i had good times full of laughs and hard working people.
good,"you can work as a cashier, a ticket cashier, a busser/janitor, any of these positions are fun and a great place to learn work responsibilities. This was a great first job out of High School."
good,"Working at the theater is so much fun and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy first job that isnt fast food or retail. While you're still technically retail and selling items to people, you're selling them tickets to a movie, something they WANT to come and see, not something they HAVE to go and buy. The General Manager (my boss) is awesome and I've met a couple others from different theaters and they've all been very nice and helpful and everyone (except the newer floorstaff) knows what they're doing."
good,"typical day was good. "
good,I would go in at 10 am to open concessions and prepare the food. My managers were great people that taught me a lot and were very pleasant to work with. I learned a variety of customer service skills and how one should speak to a customer. One of the greatest skills I feel I have learned was on how to choose my words carefully and what tone to use . My co workers were also great and friendly. The best part of my job was when we would get very occupied  with over 200 customers at the same time. I loved pushing myself and challenging myself to see how efficient and fast I could serve my customers so they can watch their movies.
good,Very fun flexible job some people only work once a week or month. some managers you hate but most are decent. free movies and 50% off concessions.
good,"As a shift leader a typical day for me would jump from one thing to the next. Being a cashier to stocking up each register (cups, popcorn bags, candy, etc.) to cleaning theaters to taking tickets. The hardest part of the job was trying to balance my work and personal life. But my favorite and most enjoyable part of the job were the days I was asked to work upstairs with the projectors."
good,"Regal was one of the best Jobs I ever had. I learned so many of basic work skills such as scheduling, payroll, inventory, and hiring. It allowed me to do alot."
good,Working at regal was really fun for me. Got to meet new people and got to know them. Got to know who they are and if you should stay away from them or not. Management was good. There will be managers who will not like newbies and will try to destroy you. It happened to me before. My co-workers were not that bad but they did know how to start drama at the last minute.
good,"This job allowed me to work with a diverse group of individuals and also interact with a large customer turnover. I was responsible for not only providing a great movie experience for customers, I was responsible for maintaining the quality of the theater to company regulations."
good,"I learned alot about multi tasking and customer service, being a cashier, and having different tasks."
good,"Regal's Cinnabar experience was a safe working environment and felt like you gained an additional family. coworkers were friendly and helpful, management had some great leaders."
good,"I love working at Regal, I've even left another job that paid me more and gave me more hours because I love Regal so much. It's not just the perks but I genuinely enjoy being there. I don't dread coming to work, everyone is so nice and understanding and helpful! It's collaborative and inclusive. And the perks! Free movies, free popcorn and drinks and half-off other concessions. The managers are super nice and easy to talk too, they're understanding and approachable. They're really good with flexible hours, it's a great place."
good,"Management is great. Working there is fun, fast paced, and easy for young workers. I would reccomend this as a starting job, but due to lack of ability to move up and relatively low pay, I would recommend staying here and relying on this job to help you make your way through college."
good,"Working here was always fun, helping people and providing a good experience for them was always important and taken seriously. I never had a bad day and when I did, I would bounce right back."
good,"Throughout my time of working there, there were ups and downs. But overall experience that I had was great. It was unfortunate that I had to quit that job due to lack of hours and the fact that it wouldn’t be busy at all."
good,I recommend regals movie theatre as a great place to work at. You'll experience alot of great customer service and alot of cool personal benefits along with the job. And the people working there are super cool relative people so it's a nice work atmosphere.
good,"Scheduling can be a hassle at times. Will occasionally close and be required to open next day. "
good,I love working at regal sad it came to an end. The environment was exciting being around people everyday and holding mini convos with them as they came through my line and as I may walked by asking if they may have needed any help
good,"Can be hectic, but you are never bored. There is always something to do. Mangers are cool. The concession stand was my least favorite, can be overwhelming and hot"
good,Work place was enjoyable. Great amount of customer service. You get to practice being professional. There was room for improvement and advancement. They work with your schedule well.
good,"A typical day at work is manning the concession or box office area. The job is not hard at all but can get busy when new movies come out. The job may have lag times but you do get to know the people you work with and get good customer service experience. The most enjoyable part is the free movies and half off concession pricing. Although I am payed close to minimum wage, i do enjoy the job very much"
good,Unfortunately it was temporary as Regal was a great place to work with great people!  Training was communicated precisely of what their expectations were.
good,Regal was really fun. I only ever had one bad customer and every other customer was very nice. All the managers were really guiding and caring and nice.
good,"A typical day can be great, especially with the right crew working with you that day. "
good,Work at Regal was a great experience and gave me a lot of new experiences and training. The day to day run down was simple just provide excellent service to the customer and everything was set.
good,Workin for regal entertainment group was a fun learning experience for me i learn how to bartend workin for them learn how to be patience with my self and others learn how to be more head on as a leader and not to be lead by my job not my manijers good place
good,"This was a great starter job. Lots of time doing things and on your feet, the hours fly by. Fun and easy responsibilities. Your people skills will improve greatly."
good,Ultimately left because I worked there for so long and still didn't make $8/hr. There were never opportunities to move up within our theatre and I knew I wanted to go back to college eventually. Left for a banking job which provided benefits and paid time off.
good,Working at Regal I never felt pressured even when there was a rush. Everyone from the workers to the customers was respectful and enjoyable. They always were helpful if you had a question or needed help during an order. We worked as a team and there was always something to do whether it was cleaning or restocking. The hardest part of the job was working on a hot day as an usher. Still productive and continuous work but just very hot even with a/c.
good,A typical day of work would be very steady paced and non stressful. You meet and greet customers then go right about your day. Management friendliness makes the day go by faster.
good,Good part time job flexible hours good discounts great atmosphere this a good part time job for students or first time worker I highly recommend it to work here
good,"It was a very fun experience, working at Regal taught me about life and the real world. The hardest part about that job was dealing with rude customers. At the time I was 16 years old and have never had to deal with any rude person so it was a lot to take in when actually dealing with them."
good,Loved the job and would recommend this for anyone looking to get a start in the movie business. Great management and staff who genuinely care about your success.
good,Managers are laid back due to the general nature of the job. Many of the entry level managers are the age of the employees which leads to friction and sometimes a lack of respect.
good,"i enjoyed working at regal very much i made new friends got along with my managers. i learned you cant trust anyone nomatter how close you are the hardest part working at regal was doing conssesions and dealing with disrespectful customers . the most enjoyable was ushering, theater checking and podium....if i could i would work at regal again most of everyone there made me feel part of the team"
good,I loved working here. It was very easy to pick up and learn right away. You had a different position everytime you came in for work! You get chances to advance your career. I loved it!
good,This was a great job to have. I really enjoyed the customers and my employees. If there was an opportunity to become a full-time manager I would have stayed.
good,"Management is great, they make sure every is doing what they're supposed to be doing. A typical day at work would be serving customers all day, handling cash and making sure they are satisfied."
good,"Great job for summer. Fun working environment.  Late working hours, so its great for night owls. Good way to learn how to work with a team. Management is just as much apart of the team."
good,Fun place to work with fun atmosphere and great teamwork. Loved the team and duties as they made the day go by quickly. Love movies which was a major perk also.
good,"The best part of being a Regal Cast member was being part of a team that brings magic into peoples lives.  If we do our job right the guests have a great time every time.  It is fast paced, and I love every second of it."
good,They pay here is low. The only good thing about the job is that you receive free tickets anytime. The coworkers are pretty awesome and  the managers are good.
good,"Working enviornment is pretty fast paced most of the time especially during the Summer. The managers are pretty flexible and relaxed, and work with you on your schedule."
good,Depending on time of day it's usually slow paced and easy-going. Management was outstanding. It's a fun place to get to know your customers and your coworkers. Definitely recommend this job.
good,Ive been working for regal for at least 5 months and I loved learning in this kind of enviroment skills i wouldve never learned if it werent for Regal
good,"assist customers with any information needed, direct customers, rip tickets by the door, assist in cleaning maintain the theater clean at the end of every movie."
good,I've been working here almost a year now and the job is honestly a good job. It takes a little to settle in but once you do you'll love the job. It can get dirty at times but the staff and management make you wanna stick around. Plus the free movie tickets are nice
good,"Great place to work certified two years (2016,2017). The people are friendly and make this place a good, fun job to be at. Sometimes there are long hours, and customers are not always nice, but that is to be excepted in the Customer service field."
good,"Fun workplace, Fast pace, Good benefits, recommend for high-school students, you and a guest get to see free movies. Employees get a discount on products as well."
good,"The work place is not for the faint of heart. Many customers are disrespectful, and feel superior to you. Although the employees and management take this very well, we are human too, with feelings. Besides the customers feeling entitled to everything , my experience at regal has been good. Mainly because we are like a family at regal."
good,"On a normal day at work, I experienced just about every situation you can think of aside from the dangerous ones. I have learned how to calm an angry customer without manager help, and I've also learned when management is needed. The work environment is a rather fun and upbeat one thanks to the other cast members. Even during the rush they still managed to make it fun and stress free. The most enjoyable part of the job had to be the day to day fun we had. A good amount of the time, the managers would let us learn how to do their jobs such as sorting through coupons, counting product, and showing us how to change the filters on the different screens. The hardest part of the job had to be the standing on my feet for a solid 9 or more hour shifts. everything else was tolerable."
good,Enjoy working for Regal. Have good benefits. Wonderful bosses that was great to work for. I would still be working there if I hadn't move to another city.
good,This is a very good entry level job for high school students. Management does their best to work around school schedules and other job schedules. Great place to work
good,"As being a manager for over 8 years I can absolutely say that I miss it. I miss my staff and I miss all of our projects that we would do and talk about. That being said, as a manager we had to make sure film integrity and sound quality were on key. We had to make sure that every digital projector was working properly and the 2k-4k lamps were not running low on hours. We had to maintain inventory every night and on every thursday perform a corporate inventory. We also had to make sure that the staff we had downstairs were maintaining the concession stand and booth office accordingly. As well as tickets being taken and stock was properly in place. Delegation and running around was a big thing that was known to everyone. When I worked there it was a friendly fun family oriented place and I would have never have left if something else better came into place."
good,Typical day consisted of selling concessions/tickets and cleaning up each theater. I learned a lot of customer service qualities at this job. Management was good and they were professional. Co-workers were easy to work with and nice. Hardest part were rush times and keeping the customers happy. Most enjoyable times were the free movies and popcorn.
good,The place is very flexible with hours and are able to accommodate emergencies. The staff is fun to work with and when we are busy we do well with keeping down the lines.
good,"Working at Regal is a fun job if you are going to school at the same time. There is no room for improvement after a point. Just had a new Associate management change. They have new Associate managers and they aren't train well enough. There is a lot of free time from work, so you can have a social life. The job culture is pretty neat.  There is no benefits if you are part time. The only people that get benefits are the General manager and Assistant manager."
good,"My years working there were extremely fun as a teen, learning customer services skills will benefit you in the long run. Team atmosphere, made good friends. Good memories."
good,"The work space is always very friendly, everyone is easy going. When it comes down to working hard mostly everyone is on the same page."
good,"A typical day at work includes offering superior guest services, going above expectations. I was always able to be a team player and was allowed to lead other employees."
good,"Overall my BEST job, the skills I learned at Regal carry over into every job I have ever had and ever will have. "
good,Most days I get in early so I can get emails done and be ready for the  team meeting. We than plan out the day based on how many employees are scheduled and the amount of business we typically have for that day. The hardest part working as a manager at a movie theatre is we are sometimes caught off guard with the amount of business we might have. Nonetheless coworkers and I are able to have our game plan set up due to the meeting we have prior opening. The best part of working at Regal is our ability to work as a team and make quick decisions that are needed to improve our business.
good,"Fun place to work with good people. Managers genuinely care and want to help, although the pay was very low. Free movies is a benefit of that, and good at getting requests for time off."
good,A typical day at work starts with getting concession ready for our customer rush depending on the movie times. Being able to meet people from all around the world was very interesting. I learned that even though working at a movie theater can seem like a lot of fun it takes a lot of patience to deal with all customers. Management always worked around my schedule. I worked well with co-workers and even build new friendships. There wasn't anything really hard about the job I enjoyed the experience at Regal Entertainment Group.
good,"A typical work day is just basically dealing with customers hands on. You work with people who are a lot of fun to be around, and we make sure that no one is left out. This is a very simple, and easy job to be honest."
good,Make sure there is enough product for consumer. Also checking customer out.
good,"Typical day at work, is seeing families come to the theatre on a family outing. Talking with the customers making them feel welcome and want them to return."
good,handling money and interact with a lot of cumstomers on a min to min bases.
good,"great work flow, plenty to do even on a dead night. co-workers were ton of fun and you meet a great variety of people. Great customer service and employee interaction. "
good,"Overall, I've enjoyed working for the Regal Entertainment Group and have made long lasting friendships with co-workers. On the clock, you can eat popcorn and drink the sodas and there's even employee discounts on some food on and off the clock. The scheduling works great if you are a student, it is a great part time job."
good,"Working at the Regal Texas Station was a good experience for myself. I learned how to multi-task in a fast paced work environment, The enviroment was fun. It even helped me become good at cusomer service."
good,"A typical day at Regal Cinemas is usually a slow day, weekends are busier. This was my first job so I learned that you have to put in some extra ""behind the scenes"" work to keep a business like this going especially a company that is well-known. Management staff has a great chemistry and very easy to talk to with no problems. My co-workers are hilarious and makes the job fun each day I went to work. The hardest part of the job at the time was staying until the last movie is finished because that means you can be there until 3am depending on how long the last movie is. The most enjoyable part is the customers and the employees because the customers can also make the job fun to because you are having random conversation with them while getting them taken care of before they enter into the theater."
good,"Loved the technical aspect of learning projection. Working customer service, box office, and usher were also some of my favorites. Laid back and fun during down times, productive and fast-paced during busy times."
good,"one of the best jobs I ever had, fun place great people, helped with college courses and hours, had to leave due to ot building was on being sold out from under us"
good,You working for the Regal means fun excitement and comfort.no one is on your back ! You feel like everyone is family and you get first hands on on the person coming to watch a movie it’s the best place to watch a movie we keep it clean and updated.
good,"Regal is a great, fast-paced exciting environment to work in, you get to usually work with people who are passionate about movies, or just an enthusiast who just likes to watch what's new. working there I learned so much about communicating with customers, as well as the floor staff. I always looked forward to what new challenges came my way when working there. I just only wish we had a few more people working during the day."
good,Loved the fast pace and being able to sit in box office while working. Loved most customers and enjoyed the atmosphere. Always loved the employees . Movies and time off was a well balance for part time. Managers only would get insurance full time offered to supervisors only. Pt didnt qualify
good,i enjoyed working at Regal but i was on a seasonal schedule. After 6 months i was not welcomed back because they said i had missed a few shifts and never showed up I was a bit perplexed by this because  i was told to call in for my schedule every WEDNESDAY which i always did and i would repeat my hours with them on the phone. But for example they would give me Tuesdays and Friday one week and when I would show up on Tuesday someone would tell me dont  come in on Friday because we made an error with your schedule and this happened more than one time. Now when i think about it I tend to believe that because I am an Aspie on the spectrum they would tend to make me feel that it was my wrong doing and  not anyone else that could have messed up. Its a ashame because I enjoyed working there and everyone was very nice..
good,"I will always say this was one of my favorite companies to work for. I liked the people I worked with and it helped me develop the Customer Service skills I use to this day to get where I am. We would get customers that actually went up to managers and complimented the staff we had working, all the time."
good,"The job is fantastic if you're not worried on pay. But I learned many things ranging from customer service to logistics, and stocking. I believe the job is great, and I regret to be saying goodbye to it, but It just doesn't help me at the end of the day for bills."
good,"Regal Azalea is a great job for any teen or young adult looking for a job. It's a great start and has good benefits, free movies and discounted food!!"
good,"long work day.     lots of standing, walking around, which was a perk. management was good but there was no opportunity to advance from floor staff to management."
good,I used to work there and I enjoyed everyday coming to work and it was my first job at the time.I love the atmosphere of the movies and popcorn and making people’s day
good,"The job is busy at times but mostly it’s pretty laid back. There are three main jobs: cleaning theaters and lobby, selling tickets, and selling concessions"
good,The position was a lot of fun and I learned so much about customer service and how to help people. The staff and management is amazing and the teamwork that is there is so good
good,"The biggest thing I learned at Regal Entertainment Group is the idea of putting the customer's needs ahead of my own. It was an environment wherein time management was key, especially during weekends and holidays. You come in ready to work and don't stop until it is time to go home."
good,"Regal is a great place to work out, you always look forward to coming to work. As a plus you get to react with customers a lot more than most job, wheather it be giving an opinion on a movie or customer telling you how there movie was."
good,"I loved working at Regal this job was the real definition of family, and loving others while working. There was never really a disappointment this job except for he/she say with co-workers, and cleaning the theaters by yourself, and 30 minute breaks. Other than that this is a great job for beginners."
good,"I have worked for a year and it has been a WONDERFUL first job it is fun fast and stable. "
good,Work can become stressful during the busy times and sometimes guest are not so pleasant but the majority of the time it is a great place to work. Managers are flexible to your needs and there is always openings allowing for advancement in the company..
good,the movie jobs is a first job. everyday is always something new going on. get to watch movie for free when every you want which is great. just the pay suck
good,I was suggest Regal to be a great company to work at for someone in high school or recently graduated and attending college. Busy and fast paced but enjoyable.
good,It was a very good atmosphere to gain friendship and experiance in all fields. Regal cross-trains their employees to know how to accomplish all jobs. The hardest job is cashier and multitasking but it gets easier as you preform the job.
good,"This job has let me gain great relationships with amazing co-workers on and off the clock.  Management is very fair with everyone, no favoritism.  I enjoy working here because it's a place always from home and drama and there's always something to do even on the slow days."
good,"They know how to treat an employee would strongly recommend working there, Although the only thing I didn't really like was them cutting shift hours. That had a lot of us upset but othe than that great place to see new faces and interact with customers."
good,Very nice environment to work. Management was very forthcoming. I loved to come to work everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job was conversing with all the people that you meet through out the day.
good,"A typical day working for Regal Entertainment was either really busy or slow but we made sure we got all of our work done as well as stayed productive. I learned a lot about how to do truck orders, unloading, and stocking. The management was very well maintained as well as they actually cared about each employee and their needs. The hardest part of the job was sometimes to find something to do during the slowest times of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interactions with the customers as well as with my fellow  co-workers."
good,"I, personally, think Regal is a very nice place to work. All the cast members are really nice and the management was understanding of any issues you may have had. The schedules were flexible and would work around your needs or wants. They were completely understanding of the fact you have a life outside of work and you could request days off to just spend a day with your family or anything like that. They made it really easy and simple when teaching you how to do all the work that goes behind selling tickets or food or cleaning. They're a very great company to work for."
good,my favorite job so far. I like almost everyone i worked with. The management was good. It was fun job even when you had to clean the theaters. Overall a great place
good,"I liked my job a lot but had to leave do to personal reason. The work environment was good. It was sometimes difficult dealing with the customers, but overall I learned and enjoyed my experience at Regal Cinema 9."
good,"You get to work with a lot of really fun people. Concession stands and ushering tend to be the most interactive jobs. Box office was my favorite, but is a bit more secluded. Typical 8 hour shift, 30 min unpaid lunch break. Sometimes you have to stay until 3am to finish closing after a midnight premiere."
good,"My responsibilities at this job were to have a smile on my face at all times, be polite, and make sure all guest were served with the proper care. I also had to make sure the kitchen, lounging area, and restrooms stayed clean."
good,I learned how to be a better communicator towards the customers as well as the employees especially when I got promoted. The management was overall good and always helped out when things were busy. The most enjoyable part of the job was how casual things were. Within management we all were pretty much friends and it was always a good work environment.
good,"it was a nice place to work, fun environment. great staff and hard working, i loved it so so much. pretty normal stuff.hb h h h g   hbhhi y jb ubj iu its making me type more."
good,"Worked for Regal for 17 years and couldn't be any more happier, just time to pursue my dream job. There are always advancement opportunities not just local but all over the country. Benefits are great and hours are very flexible, that is how I was able to go to school and get my degree. Good place to learn basic technical, money and customer service skills."
good,"Working hard for low wages. Managers are chill and employees are fun to be around. I work all 3 jobs at Regal. I do box office, concessions, and usher. It is a fast paced environment with. Reaks inbetween movies."
good,"Working at Regal was a lot of fun. My managers were the best, my coworkers were the best, everything was great about Regal except the pay, but we got benefits and a lot of overtime. Our managers treated us well. I really enjoyed working there."
good,"handle cash register, supervise and make food, count inventory for whole sale items, facilitate birthday parties and summer camps, clean theaters, issue movie times and tickets, very excellent customer service skills, i seen old a new management come in. i loved my job it kept me happy and my customers knew me."
good,"the good environment here is noticeable. However, I get vey few hours. I barely get 2 days a week. I only get two free passes."
good,The most exciting job you will ever have. fast paced action from beginning to end. low pay but free tickets. Good for a first job.
good,"A typical day at work would include helping customers with the best customer service I could, counting money, invoices, and security."
good,Regal was a great workplace with good managers and employees. the environment grows on you at a fast pace. everyone there treated you with respect and gave you clear instruction on what your job duties were.
good,"Every saturday morning I referee boys and girls basketball games. This was one of the best part time jobs I ever had. Not only did I referee the games, I helped the kids play the game the right way."
good,This job had me working with customers which i love to do. This job helped me to communicate with customers.The manager at this job was wonderful and is also great at is job. My co-workers helped me get through this.
good,my typical day involved working with customers and giving them drinks and popcorn. i learned how to work  touch screen cash register and im pretty good at it
good,"Regal Entertainment Group is an excellent place to work. Although it starts at minimum wage, there is always room to move up if you truly want to and make the efforts that you should to improve the theater and your work environment. It is such a fun place to be, it is just about impossible to leave without a smile on your face every day or night that you work. Everyone is so versatile and friendly. Certain theatres are better than others, but the one I work at is fantastic. I would suggest this job to anyone, especially highschool kids just starting out. It is a wonderful place to get experience and truly see how a work environment should be as well as your attitude towards all of your work life's endeavors. All the while you may not start out with much, hours are always promising and they are always willing to work with you on everything as long as you yourself are reasonable. It is a wonderful place to work."
good,Awesome and fast paced place to work. From floor staff to management level all about customer service.
good,"Depending on where you work you can have a lot of fun. During the week it can be extremely boring and lame with close to no customers coming in at all sometimes. However, when its really busy it is a lot of fun! It was almost as if the more work there was to do the more fun it was to be working. The management is usually very awesome and usually treat their employees as family members rather than employees they can bark orders to. The hardest part of the job is making sure you have fun even when its boring. You just need to find something to do and managers will see that youre still working even when there is no work to really do. The most enjoyable part would be working in concession and or usher because you can seriously have a blast if you just learn to smile!"
good,Great company to work for.  Offers benefits and free movies.  
good,Regal Entertainment was a great job for working around school scheduling. Many different types and groups of people were always coming throughout the day.
good,I think that this is a great place to work. Everyday you go into work and you know what you'll be doing for the day. The management staff is great and have great customer service skills. You will have the opportunity to advance to the management staff once a position opens up.
good,"A typical day at work involved opening the building, setting up daily inventory, reviewing cash balances and monitoring employees. I also built and initiated films."
good,Working for the Regal company I loved how fast paced it was and the staff was very welcoming when I first started.
good,It was a good place to work while going to school. I was able to have a flexible work schedule while going to college before I left the state.
good,"Spent over 11 years at Regal.  It was an exciting adventure that helped me sharpen my customer facing skills.  Within a month after starting, I was recognized for my ability to work independently.  Each annual review I scored 99 with 100 being the best.  Many times over I was asked to train new team members."
good,"Prepare yourself for a lot of fast paced fun while working for Regal. The theater level positions are great for students who are looking to work in a great environment. From greeting customers at the door to serving up popcorn and selling tickets in the box office you have the joy of creating a great date night, family night, friends night out or whatever occasion brings people to the movies! You get the talk films and film trivia all day, so if you love movies and the movie making business, this is the place to be! As a member of management I got to make the job fun while making sure things were getting done. And though it is stressful on big movie weekends, the customers and people you'll work with make it all worth it!"
good,Really enjoyed working for Regal. First job in Tennessee. Great crew to work with. Very professional administrators. Incentives. Very friendly co-workers.
good,Working at regal was a great experience and I had a lot of fun. It's a great initial job for someone. I really enjoyed the people I worked with and the predictability of the workday.
good,Overall working for this company was great but restrictive in many ways that I needed a change to be able to afford my bills. It was a wonderful work environment and not a place for slackers.
good,My experience over all at Regal was a great part time job to have. Everyone there is very respectful and kind. Management was always supportive if I needed anything.
good,"As a previous crew member for regal entertainment group my time there was excellent. Very welcoming and family oriented at regal, hours were flexible with my schedule and the work environment was a blast to be around"
good,"A typical day was decent. The management was understanding and fun, but also professional. The employees worked hard and made work enjoyable as much as they could."
good,My experience at regal entertainment group has been a good one. I have worked there since I was 16. The company has treated me well and I have nothing negative to say about it.
good,"Very fun job for beginners "
good,I get a schedule of the end times for the movies of the day.  I then go clean the auditoriums according to the previous mentioned schedule. I check the restroom periodically to make sure their adequate for guest use.  I learned to work effectively in a team environment from this job.
good,"One location was awesome, relaxed environment with cool staff. The other was much stricter with longer work days and less breaks. One gave a mid shift break to everyone if worked over 5 hours, the other gave a break only to concessions on some days"
good,"I had this job fresh out of high school, it was nice because it put some extra money in my pocket, but it wasn't really enough to pay the rent. I mean I was living at my parents house with plans to leave for college, and I regret leaving this job in lieu of going to college, but It definitely isn't a career for everybody. There was opportunity for advancement, if you took the steps, but they never talked to me about it, but then I was only there for a year."
good,Was based out of the Tallahassee location and loved every minute of my experience. Was never over-busy and enjoyed my co-workers. Great job for those looking for some extra cash.
good,I will say this has been my favorite job to work at. The management was very friendly and made you feel like work was home. All the workers got along great and they go by a system that never leaves the theatre looking bad even during the craziest rushes.
good,"Great first job as a highschooler, very flexible hours, need something new now and with a higher pay is the main reason for leaving. Would without a doubt recommend to a friend."
good,"I took this job as a stop gap between jobs initially, that was 3 years ago. This is the most laid back job I have ever had and I really like the work environment. I get paid above minimum wage which is nice, but we are not allowed to get anywhere close to full time hours."
good,Working for Regal Entertainment Group was a enjoyable opportunity while I was in high school and after high school. Made lots of friends and gained a lot of customer service experience along the way for the years that I did work for the company. I would recommend working for the company as a first job for anyone still in high school or is looking to have a job to get out of the house and not be home alone. Pay was fair and seeing movies for free was a plus as well.
good,"It was good easy pace where it was fast and slow.  I learned how to deal with difficult customers and still give them their best experience.  Management was kind and understanding for the most part there was one manager that made working here a nightmare.  Everyone that worked there were really good.  The hardest part of the job was keeping track of all inventory, and the most enjoyable part of the job was the people and seeing movies anytime."
good,"I worked there for 4.25 years in high school and college, and I came back because I enjoyed the experience. Not much has changed, and it's still fun and fast paced. The focus is good customer service and physical labor, both of which I enjoy."
good,"Working at Regal theaters provides a lot of experience with teamwork, cash handling, food handling, and customer service, and fluctuates between busy and slow days. The management is extraordinary and the main reason I stayed so long."
good,"Being a manager at Regal has helped me blossom, I have become better at customer service. I know how to handle almost any situation when it comes to a customer complaint and they are always satisfied when they leave."
good,"My time at Thornton place 14 and imax (1937) was amazing. It was one of the most fun jobs id ever had. My job at Auburn 16 was the worst experience id ever had.They had incompetent management staff, incompetent core staff, and an overall awful workplace. While regal is amazing to work for, with good benefits, make sure you case the individual theatre you are looking at before you commit."
good,I loved working here. All my co workers were great people and never had problems with each other. Everyone got along well and the management was awesome.
good,"Regal cinemas was my first job. I absolutely loved working here as it was a very fun and energetic workplace. Working Here, I learned customer service skills, as well as cashier skills. I worked any thing from customer service to sweeping floors."
good,It’s a great company to work for and it was an incredible first job. I learned how to work quickly under stressful situations and also keep calm and I learned how to work well with my other co workers
good,I really enjoyed working at Regal. It was a great company to work for. I would highly recommend working here if you are going to school. They do give raises the longer you work there. and there is opportunity to grow with the company if youd like.
good,"The Theatre is a great place for anyone who is looking to get into the entertainment business. The current General Manager (Rex) is amazing and truly helps to shape employees into productive, successful  individuals. It is one large tight nit family which sometimes causes a lot of drama. Corporate does not seem to care about employees or compensating them well."
good,it all depends on movies coming out. if no new movies are coming out working there is pretty okay. but if a new movie ie. wonder woman or guardians of the galaxy comes out you have backed up lines at concessions and people that decided to come late to their movie are getting attitudes because they came late to the movie they've made plans for last night
good,"very slow during the opening hours a lot of time spent waiting on customers . a lot of work was done when we were closed. counting drawers, counting the safe, making deposits, routine maintenance of the projectors."
good,Regal Cinemas is a great place to work. It is a fast pace environment which can be tiresome but I enjoy that type of work. Moving up in this company is fairly easy and very rewarding. The most enjoyable part of this job was the free movie tickets. I very much enjoyed working for this company and if not for having to move would probably be there still but as a first assistant.
good,"Regal was a decent place to work. A typical day at Regal is either selling tickets cleaning theaters and selling outrageous priced food. The management at my location was okay but heads with low level management however, most were decent. The pay sucks the annual pay raises sucks."
good,"Working for Regal Cinemas is by far my favorite job so far. All workers, from floor staff to management, get along like family. Leaving them will be devastating for me, but the pay is too little for me to be able to afford my expenses. Overall, anyone would love working there and i recommend the job to all of my friends and associates."
good,"Some of the managers just enjoy taking their duties too seriously. While some of the other managers are easy to communicate with Plus, it is great that our managers remind us about our Check Scores."
good,I had a lot of fun. I worked there as a teenager I got to see free movies. Free soda on breaks and popcorn. All the management is great. The movie theater is so much bigger than one would expect.
good,Working at Regal this time of year you either start at 10am or 11am and finish at 5:30pm if you work the morning shift or night shift where you start at 5pm and end at midnight. Management is filled with great people that'll show you how things are completed and can fix problems. I learned how to do many things like run the register and taught me how to deal with hordes of people. The hardest part is working the holidays and being away from family but it's part of the job and the most enjoyable part is the people that you work with.
good,A fast past easy job with alot of free things like popcorn and movies sometimes but most of all seeing new people daily.  This was my first job almost 2 years I loved it at 16
good,"A typical day at the regal cinemas includes, clocking in, pulling registers, heading upstairs to do deposit and any other concerns, stocking the stand, greeting and waiting on customers. The end of the day consists of the same things with normal closing shift duties. I have learned that the public can be sweet, and the public can be angry. Either way, to deal with issues, concerns or compliments, with the most respect possible. The management staff I work with is unbelievably amazing. So hard working, uplifting, and flexible. The employees are hard working, listen well, and really strive to make regal a better environment for our guests per management over see. The hardest part about the job would have to be the late nights and driving home in the middle of the morning. The most enjoyable part of this job is the great atmosphere and the perks the job brings."
good,This was my favorite job. Management knew what they were doing. Employees were nice and worked well together. Wasn't a full time company so not many hours.
good,"The company is amazing. The only downfall is some of the management team as they would drive good employees away.  Other than the occasional hiccup there, it was a very satisfying job."
good,"I like working at Regal Westborough because of the people. All the managers are very nice and all the other floor staff are always really friendly and supportive and I've made a lot of long lasting friends from working here. "
good,"I enjoyed my time there, staff was friendly, managers understanding and fun to work with. decent pay, easy job. Great for college or highschool students that need a part time job. Free movie tickets."
good,Easy going yet firm management that helps work around you and teach you everything you might need to know while on the job.
good,"I love movies so I decided to work at a theater.  Regal is a fun place to work, and I enjoy my job.  My co-workers are friendly for the most part, and most of the managers are nice people.  I wold like more hours, but sometimes they just aren't there.  You end up working every station at the theater which is nice as it kills job monotony.  The job doesn't pay well starting out, but the amount of work I do doesn't really warrant a big check.. You do get to go to the movies for free which is awesome.  I can even bring a friend for free.  It's a nice little perk I must say!  As far as advancement goes it seems achievable which gives me hope as I hope to move up here as well."
good,"The managers were not the best but they got the job done sacrificing the good relationship between employees."
good,"Typical day at work depends on what you are scheduled for. Cleaning theaters as an usher, selling movie tickets or you are back in the concessions stand. I've learned so much about customer service working here. Management is awesome and so are your co-workers. There is no hard part of this job but I would say the most enjoyable part is the people I work with make the day easier."
good,"The management team and co-workers were absolutely amazing. We had fun and got the job done at the same time. As Floor Staff it's hard to get a lot of hours when it isn't holiday or summertime which was a bummer. Overall, this was a very enjoyable job with great free movie benefits. The most challenging part was leaving but I had to because I needed steady hours. The most enjoyable part was the job, the customers, management, and my co-workers."
good,I was in highschool and this was the perfect job. the management staff was really nice and taught me a lot about working with people and being realiable.
good,Had to upsell customers buying concession foods.  Also had to do some cleaning and had to have a current food handlers permit.
good,"As a manager at Majestic Regal Theatre, I have learned the job duties and responsibilities such as manage employees, close out registers, and the paper work that needs to be properly filled out."
good,I would arrive count in all my products and then start assisting customers in any way possible. I learned what it is truly like in a group work setting.
good,I loved working here. The job was easy to do even when it was busy. I loved working with the manager even became friends with a few of them. Great place to be at!
good,"The work day consists of greeting customers, selling items at the concession stand, and ticket tearing. I've learned about how movies are set up and played. management and co-workers were satisfactory and the pay was decent for a starter job The hardest thing about this job was learning about how the movies were set up and played. the most enjoyable part was discounted sales for employees."
good,"Working at Regal can be a fun time. You get discounts on movies and all your co-workers have at least one thing in common with you; a love for movies! You're not likely to get fired unless you just don't show up. Most customers don't have anything mean to say, and working holidays is always fun with a team of Regal Staff."
good,celebrities come to watch movies and we have to stay calm. alot of secret shoppers. good quality service.
good,"I enjoy working at the movies, always different scenerios on a daily basis."
good,"A typical day of work starts off by what employees is taking a certain duty. For example theater cleaning, Restroom Checks, Theater Checks, Lobby, Trash ect, Experience in the process of learning involves myself learning the value of great customer experience, team work, and showmanship. Co-workers have great values and goals but as well as their own opinions. Hardest part of the job is lack of employees in which leaves one or two employees in charge of many duties that need more than two employees. Especially when management send employees home early or lack of communication. My most enjoyable part of the job is seeing new people and their lifestyle being able to approach them with customer service."
good,"This was an excellent company to work throughout my high school career. I was trained in a variety of positions that I fairly enjoyed, and was treated as apart of a family."
good,Working at the Warren is quick paced but generally quite easy. Requests off are almost always accepted and most of the management is laid back. Youll get to know your coworkers quite well as there is a lot of time to chit chat while cleaning theaters.
good,"It was really fun to work there and i gained many friends, we were basically a family. i just didn’t get paid much and i have car payments to make as well."
good,"I really can't offer much. I haven't worked at Regal in nearly four years, after being employed there previously for eight years. So, all the answers given for this survey were not accurate."
good,"i really enjoy the stall that i work with at my local theater but the problems that i have at the theater is the consistant shift cutting and the reduction of employee ticket vouchers whitch is already a strange program, so first you were able to get 2 tickets a day that were non transferable and you could go to any regal theater that had a showing of a movie you wanted that was not too full whitch was understandable but now they have cut the tickets down to 2 a week and they want us to be able to converse with customers about what each movie is like which i find a bit difficult to do now because the limmited tickets, witch i find even more crazy due to the fact that the majority of the time the theaters are mostly empty."
good,While working at regal I enjoyed interacting with the costumers and multitasking with employees. Upselling the items we sold allowed me to use my voice and accomplish goals. Prepping for the next morning by stocking  and cleaning gave me time to wind down from such a busy fast pace environment. While being in the box office I was responsible for so many things all while sitting/standing which was very rewarding when my shift was over.
good,"Exciting Fast Paced environment."
good,I loved working at regal everyone was so kind and helpful. The managers are all very friendly and helpful. I’d definitely recommend working for regal to anyone.
good,"I worked at regal for about three and a half years and it had been my favorite job. I would have continued working there if I had been paid more than just $8/hr. Management was very friendly, i had known most of them for years by the end of my employment and they all felt like family. It sucked having to leave to advance in my life. Also being able 2 free tickets and 50% 8 concession items a day was really nice and made up for low hourly wage."
good,Productive work environment with a great staff. Plus free movies and discounted concessions as a bonus among other rewards. Plenty of opportunity to advance and develop core customer service skills.  Whats not to like?
good,I met so many amazing people at Regal Cinemas. The managers are interactive with the floor staff and tried to make working there as enjoyable as possible.
good,"I enjoyed working for Regal because the Management Staff were exceptional. They were well-organized and treated every staff member with respect."
good,"As a first job where someone is just learning about the working world, this is the perfect place. It's relaxed and just fun to hang out with coworkers during downtime. If you like fast-paced shifts where it's ""go, go, go"" then work here over the weekends. The management is awesome, everyone is very friendly. Customers can get a bit angry with you when it's busy because of understaffing or if their movie is sold out, but that's just part of the job."
good,"It was fine. Good job, good co workers, just bad pay. I don't want to fill this out, I just want to job hunt. I don't know why this site won't let me move on."
good,"I loved my managers. They work with your schedules and they are patient when you're learning the ropes.  Meet and deal with a lot of people, which I thought was the best part. "
good,It was a chill and relaxed area. It pays pretty good as well. If i had the chance i'd go back.It pays decent with not to many hours. I made almost $700 the month.
good,"Regal Cinemas was great. I had a lot of fun with friends while working there, the movies were always great and customers came to have a good time, the service was friendly and I always looked forward to my shifts.!"
good,Work was usually fun and but fast paced which made the day go by so much faster. I learned how to be more friendly and interact with different people everyday.
good,I really enjoyed working at regal. The people were very nice and the training is incredibly hands on. Managers make sure you know what you are doing and are very helpful.
good,"A typical day consisted of eager customers looking for a way to a enjoy a movie for cheap. Each of their personality differed, "
good,"Regal Entertainment is a great place to work with great full time benefits. Employer matches 401K 100% with employee. Very fast paced, but easy to learn job."
good,The movies are always fun. The job is extremely easy and fun. you get to see all the new movies for free. The managers are all old employees so they know the job well.
good,It is a very fun and rewarding job as long as you are not looking for a career out of it. Regal taught me core things about the industry and customer service in general. Good job for a high school/ college kid.
good,The regal is a safe and fun place to work when you need a job to get you money while you are in college. The staff there are nice and the discounts are great.
good,"This was my first job and it was a great experience to get introduced into the work force. Easy job, nice benefits, and awesome work environment. My only issue was with the management; they were erratic and incompetent at best and very rude at worst. Still, it was a good first job but I wouldn't recommend working there for a long period of time."
good,"Regal is a fun place to work. I worked in concessions, the box office, and ushered. I learned all aspects of the theater. The hardest part of the job was getting used to the big crowds on the weekends. The most enjoyable part of working there was getting free movies. The people are a lot of fun to work with."
good,"Great place to work, nice staff, great management. Great opportunities to move up. For the most part the job is easy and there's plenty of stuff to do to keep busy."
good,"I enjoyed working for regal, the management was very professional and the tasks were fairly easy.  I enjoyed my customers and free popcorn at the end of the night!!!"
good,"A typical day at work would be busy but slowed down for like an hour then it picks back up. I learned that alot of customers may have the wrong attitude but if you show them that you care and provide the customer service you should be providing. Management was GREAT! whenever we got really busy and needed more help, they where there to hop on register and join us in the stand. The hardest part would be when there would be a rush and we would run out of something like popcorn buckets or water bottles because it takes a moment for managers to get it from our stock rooms because they are busy doing something. What I loved about working there was the staff, we all got along and it was absolutely NO drama."
good,When I needed a second opinion or consult management would always be right there to walk me through a better solution or even a co-worker.
good,Hours felt long at regal but other then that i liked the job because i was able to make a lot of friends from it. Also being able to see movies for free is  pretty cool.
good,"I was box cashier for 3 years and I loved it.  For the most part everyone was professional and a joy to work with.  When I left I felt our theatre looked as good as the day we opened.  That says a lot considering most of the cast ""employees"" were about 17 years old.  Great group that worked hard.  And we had a great GM."
good,Regal Entertainment Group is a great place to work for the past 5 years. A typical work day can be busy some days and others relaxing. I have learned many aspects of customer service plus being a leader of other employees. The co-workers are very nice to get along with. The hardest part of the job would probably be when it is slow there is not much to do. The most enjoyable part of the job would probably be the customers.
good,Working for a movie theatre is the best experience you will ever get. I deffinately would work for Regal if you are looking. You get free popcorn when working and soda. And you get Half off Concessions prices when your not. And FREE TICKETS! You get to learn a lot about working and new experiences with customer service.
good,"I have been working at Regal for almost 9 months now and I love it. if you want a job and still in high school they will give it to you. My managers are amazing people and work hard.. customers can be so nasty and they come and help. my typical day at work is usually in concession where the food and soda is sold, on a weekend usually three co workers and I are back there and we do our job but we also have fun. a lot of us just graduated or are about to and everyone gets along and its just a great time. I've learn so many people skills and how to handle different types of people. management at my regal is a 10/10 easily.. everyone thinks managers have it easy but they work so hard. my co-workers are amazing, everyone helps everyone. some are lazy but we know who to avoid. the hardest part about the job is dealing with rude ignorant people, that's the only thing hard, nothing else. most enjoyable is making new friends and allowing customers to have a great night out with friends or family or even alone by making their stay comfortable."
good,"The staff are very friendly and helpful. Your jobs here may include tearing tickets and directing people to theaters, working a cash register, or cleaning movie theaters. The job comes with free movies and discounts at the concessions."
good,"A typical day at work would be operating the concession stand, helping customers, cleaning theaters as needed, and maintaining a clean work environment. I work with two managers and sometimes with one other employee. Both management and co-workers are nice and friendly and easy to talk to. The most enjoyable part of the job are the customers."
good,"When I started out at Regal Cinemas in Washington, PA, I had no idea I would have stayed there as long as I did. We were all one big theater family."
good,"A typical day in the work place is fun because it involves cooperation throughout the staff and there is a variety of jobs that keep you busy. I have learned techniques involving the set up and mechanics of the building also how to provide positive attitude with co-workers and customers. The management staff is one of the outstanding features of the work force. I'm proud to say that they're approachable and eager to help. The hardest part of the job would be unexpected cuts. Lastly, the most enjoyable part of the job is having a variety of different tasks and enjoying my co-workers."
good,"Working there was pretty fun, working in teams to get jobs done and knowing that your helping someone enjoy their evening is amazing. Managers would work with you and apologize if they went to far."
good,"I loved working for the movie theatres, it was always fun and I loved watching free movies. Also my boss was the best! He taught me so much and made me a better manager."
good,"Opening and closing the theater. Working in box office counting the register, Making sure I knew all about the movies that were showing in the theaters at the time. Cleaning the concession stand preparing guests food or snacks. "
good,Productive and friendly management and co-workers. Flexible hours and understanding management. I enjoyed my employment at the regal cinema. We had a great team during my time of employment.
good,"I absolutely loved working for Regal Cinemas. This chain offers opportunities for advancement for all that are willing to embrace its culture, and work hard to please its customers."
good,"Fun place to work part-time as long as you're not relying on the job to pay your rent. It's the easiest job I've ever had. You can work in the box office, the concession stand, or as an usher doing theatre and bathroom checks. There is always someone to ask if you have any issues or questions."
good,"While working here I learned how to deal with customers and my co-workers, the management was great and really taught me how to do my work. The most enjoyable part was my co-workers, they were really kind to me and mainly trained me in my job. My first day behind concessions this guy made me get his popcorn and I had no idea what to do. It took me about 3 minutes. Now I am able to complete an order and its transaction in less than 30 seconds."
good,"A typical day at work would require counting and maintaining the funds in the safe, attending the guests, overseeing employee daily tasks, and sending off information to corporate. I've learned that as a manager you need to set the example for the entire staff to follow. I believe that at my current location we have a very strong management team who works well with each other. Our main focus is always on communication and how we can continue to improve it not only with the management staff but with the employees as well. I greatly enjoy the management part of my job and what it takes to oversee a whole theater and what it takes to make everything run smoothly. Having a guest leave the theater dissatisfied would have to be one of the worst parts because our staff is here to provide excellent service."
good,Birkdale 16 is one of the premier movie locations in the Charlotte area.  The employees and the management make it an enjoyable place to work.
good,"Started as a first job, wasn't planning to stay there longer than a few months. Got into management and learned a lot about how to manage time, people, a business and costumer service. Decent pay, get free movies out of working there, and meet a lot of people."
good,I learned a lot working at regal. it have taught me some life time goal and how to work with people on so many different levels. but overall regal is a good place to work
good,"Regal offered me great management experience for my future, and the skills I have attained have without a doubt prepared me for future work opportunities."
good,"This would be an ideal work place for a teenager still in High school who wants a part time job. the benefits are great! you meet new people and is always ""hip"" to the next up coming movies and midnight showings!!! "
good,Everything is put in place for you to succeed. They give you evry chance to excel. Overall a great company to work for.
good,"Great environment. I had a lot of fun working there. It got stressful, but not bad. On opening night, it would be packed, but management put people where they were strong and it would go smooth."
good,"I loved this job. So much fun. Very productive and efficient. Management was nice, willing to work around a crazy schedule. Hardest part of the job was the business at certain times. Best part of the job was the positive and fun environment."
good,Great job if it’s your first job or an in between job! Definitely flexible with hours. Great perks being 2 free movies a week and half off concessions.
good,"My coworkers were what truly made the job amazing. Good benefits, okay pay, always a lot to do. "
good,I have felt welcomed since day one and I never thought I could enjoy a job and staff as much as I do here. The management is incredible and it is a great work enviorment.
good,I have worked for Regal for 11 year. The managers are amazing. The experience has given me strong communication skills and the ability to work will in high pressure situations
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Regal good environment, made a lot of friends and working with them was a real pleasure. I would really recommend  for young people that are looking for the first job."
good,"Regal very easy first job, what kid wouldnt want to work here. Very easy concession stand, and ushering as well one of the easiest jobs ever and allthe movies you'd like to see."
good,"Great environment, developed by the other employees. Management does everything they can to make sure everything goes as smoothly as possible. The people that come through are very often very nice, courteous and patient."
good,They were very positive and helpful towards me and others. They were great leaders and they were very strict on making sure every customer left happily.
good,This was a excellent work environment. Staff works well together. Shows respect & consideration for each other. Customer service was both fast & efficient with amazing hospitality. Would definitely recommend for anyone searching for a positive work environment.
good,"A wonderful place to have a first job. Everyone is extremely kind and helpful to new people. Management can not only be seen as one's boss, but as a friend and teammate. Overall best work experience I've had and I'm glad to have worked there."
good,"Awesome place to work. Management is great and care about cast members. Hours aren't the greatest but i cant complain. Great benefits on and off the clock. Good for a first job or for a retiree. Not a good temporary job, as you will want to stay there for the long run to see any growth/more hours"
good,"This was my absolute dream job. I loved working here, my coworkers were very friendly and most of my managers were really great. If I could, I'd love to return to this job."
good,Great experience. It was a very fun part time job to have over the summer. I was able to work with various individuals and meet various different people who came over to watch movies.
good,it’s about who you work with. was a great job honestly but not enough shift options for managers so you pretty much only work nights and weekends even when you move up in seniority
good,"Through working at Regal Entertainment for almost one year, I can say that it's a fun place to work at. The managers and the employees are very sweet and friendly, and when things don't come easy, there are people willing to help you get through it. It can get busy during mass showings of a certain movie and on other days, it may be slow. But for working there for 8 months, I learned how to be a leader to the other employees, and how to grow in my work experience. I did leave the company due to the amount of hours and the shifts given, but I would for sure apply again maybe to another theatre. The hardest part of the job is having that fast-paced mindset going through your head. The job is fun if you make it fun. A typical day at work, is grabbing your tubs, cups, and paper bags and heading to a cash register. There is a board in the back, that tells you what register you are on, what time you go on break and your shift hours. Overall, working there with everyone felt like another family to me and I really enjoyed my experience there."
good,The application and interview process was really easy. The work is extremely easy. You get cross trained so that you are able to do any position with ease. The management is really great and helpful. You get 2 free tickets everyday and half off everything else. The only con is that the pay is minimum wage.
good,good job i really liked to work with the co workers. everyone got the job done and worked well together. the management took time to listen to complaints and helped work things out
good,"I personally love working here, I've learned to much things such as improving on customer service, how to work with different people, as well as communication skills. Also, dealing with satisfied and unsatisfied customers. It is a very welcoming place, you feel comfortable with the people you work with, you also build very strong bonds with your managers, employees and even daily customers. I enjoy working Friday and Sunday nights. I mostly get excited working box shifts. But working here made me improve my communication skills, customer service skills and time management skill (working faster to end lines)"
good,"A typical work day depends on how many customers come in. We might get a lot of customers and it will get extremely fast-past or not have too many customers then it gets slow."
good,"Its a relaxed workplace, management are easy going but serious. Rules are rules and if you break a rule then you are dealt with accordingly, fair treatment among staff an there is no signs of favoritism. The staff is friendly with each other and its easy to get along with the people around around you. No one is ever put out there for no reason and information is always communicated effectively as needed. I like how everyone works together and gets along, and if there is an issue it doesn't need to go right to management because the staff can usually take care of it. and the hardest part of the job can be finding something to do during slow periods but all around its a very wonderful place to work"
good,"I really enjoy working with the other employees at Regal, as they is a really fun and collaborative environment. Beyond that, the employee benefits of free movies on a daily basis and discounted concessions are excellent for an entry-level job. However, it is an entry-level job, and thus both part-time and minimum wage. Overall, though, Regal is a great place to work"
good,I loved working there everything ran peacefully it as a family place everyone treated each other like family. Customer's would leave the place with a smile on there face. I would recommend this place to everyone if i had to.
good,a typical day at work is pretty busy but its fun. I learned how to prioritize. The management is there to help the customers and the employees and they are willing to answer questions
good,the managers are always a pleasure to work with. all of the employees are incredible friendly. at time the day can be very slow or very fast paced. sometimes hours are not the best though.
good,"I love working at the movie theatre. I manage employees, maintain customer service and accountability of inventory. Hours are crazy due to being open 365 days a year."
good,I had a lot of fun since it was my first job as a 16 year old.  I worked hard and within 2 years I became a manager.  I worked for almost 5 years but decided to broaden my work history for future jobs.
good,This is a very easy and fun job to have. A typical day of work keeps you busy and doing a variety of tasks. You constantly deal with customers and learn a vast amount of skills.
good,I enjoyed working for them. They had all kind of customers and you always were busy. You also got to see movies for free which was a bonus. You just couldn't see it on opening weekend.
good,I loved working there. The people I worked with were great. I loved what I did. I never ounce wanted to quit. The reason I left the job was unfair but I digress.
good,I was wiring enclosures and that is done at your own pace. Appearance and accuracy of the work is extremely important. Give them an honest 8 hours and be there every day and its a fine atmosphere and the people and management are all good. It can be challenging to learn to read the electrical blueprints but its all learnable in time. Loved the job!
good,Truly a great place to work. Employees where one of a kind even tho there were always new ones. It was a unique experience. Management was always willing to help better there employees.
good,"Morning Shifts during the week you have Three Employees for each station which are Box Office, Concession, and Ticket Taker/Door Person including a Manager at all times. We start off the day turning on the projectors for the featured film of the week, organizing our stations, double check our banks and give round checks to each theater rooms. Closing Shifts tend to get a lot busier at times, especially when it's PREMIER Night. You have Two through Three Concessions,One Door person, One Box Person, Two Ushers and Two Closing Managers. "
good,"Working at the movie theater had all the great perks.  Watching movies after my shift without buying a ticket, bringing in friends and family to watch movies with for a discount price.  All the drinks and popcorn while working for free."
good,"All my coworkers were great people to work with, and those that weren't got weeded out fairly quickly because they couldn't thrive in such a positive environment. You can't beat being able to see free movies on your time off, and getting free popcorn and soda on your breaks."
good,they are across the country so you are able to transfer anywhere.  they promot with in instead of brining in new employees for higher positions. nights and weekends are all the shifts available
good,A nice day at work begins with me opening up shop and getting the first customers in a seat for the cheapest shows of the day. I learned to be patient with people because the customer is always right even if they may seem wrong. Managment was a real team we would stick up for one another and keep the ball rolling. work culture was good and solid because we always had the right move planned for the next scenario. The hardest part of the job was the real busy weekend but they went by fast often. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people they were always so nice.
good,"I loved working at Regal. The management team was amazing. They worked with you, and took very good care of you as long as you showed them you wanted to be there. I would recommend this job to anyone. The team was fun and hard working, with an excellent management team."
good,Regal Entertainment Group is a great company to work for. The benefits are fair and the pay is fair. It is a good first job and even a good career for those who fall in love with the company! There is always opportunity to advance with in and good employee incentives!
good,"I really enjoyed working at my Regal theater. While we were frequently busy due to having many screens and being located in the middle of a shopping center, I learned how to help guests in a quick and efficient manner. My coworkers were incredible and it felt like they were another family."
good,"During the weekdays or Mondays-Thursdays the days are pretty slow and laid back until around 6:30pm to about 7:45pm. Weekends, Fridays-Sundays, are always a lot busier, always full of people and requests. During my time I've learned valuable people skills and money handling. In terms of management I would never complain. Every manager there is always able to handle every situation that comes to them and the ones that we as employees still cant handle ourselves. The hardest part of the job if I am to be honest is to just talk with the customer. To not sound like a machine when asking them questions or just asking if they need anything else even though the most certainly shouldn't spend anymore. The most enjoyable part is the feeling of family. When the rush of people finally slows down and we can all take a breather. Because then we can finally start closing and head home. Overall working at the Regal isn't such a bad idea if you just wanna few extra bucks."
good,"Regal has a great sense of who is hired and how things are run. Things are very relaxed and easy to work with. Typical day includes cleaning and checking auditoriums. I've learned how to take better care of my customer service skill set. The culture is very much alive nationally. Hardest part would be cleaning up messes which to be honest is not hard at all. The best part of the job would have to be the fact that you can do your job all while still being able to have fun, relax, have conversations, and be productive."
good,"Fun place to work, worked around my schedule as a part time employee. Very satisfied with my coworkers. The pay could have been better. Overrall a good place."
good,The movie theater is a great place to hangout and meet a lot of new people especially when you work there. Sometimes the days can be stressful due to the rush of people but the managers are always around to comfort you.
good,The position can be overwhelming to some because of its fast pace but you can get used to it and you make good friends along the way. The work environment requires teamwork which eventually builds friendships and makes the job feel less like a job each shift. It can potentially take up long nights and weekends but the scheduling is flexible and the managers are helpful.
good,"The management was friendly, the staff and my co-workers were friendly and we had fun and got along while doing our jobs as a team. The job tasks weren't too strenuous. I would really be ok with working here or someplace similar."
good,"I absolutely love working here. It is a temporary job for me, but it has been my favorite part-time job so far. The atmosphere is so interesting, because it is a movie theatre, but the people here breathe new life into it. Everyone has incredible attitudes which it very helpful on slow days. All in all, just a lovely part-time job, and very easy duties as well! No one person is shouldered with all the responsibility, as it should be."
good,"Regal was a great place to work, everyone there was friendly and always helpful when you needed it. Hours were flexible and I learned a lot about the workplace."
good,"At Regal I learned all the basic skills for working in general. Arriving at work on time and maintaining a professional demeanor at all times. Working as a part of a team and later managing teams. Bieng organized and neat with my work was one of the first things I learned given that as a concessions manger inventory was key and for that you must be organized.Customer service skills were sharpened with many customers that had to leave our theater satisfied with there movie experience in every aspect of the experience. Regal customers had to be provided with great customer service in the ticket booth and the concession stands. Preparing for rush hour was just as important as improvising when a customer had a request or complaint, our customers where always right and we had to make sure everyone left with a smile while simultaneously optimizing sales and profitability for the theater."
good,excellent for a night time job to learn more about business. Best part is the free movies. You will have to work most holidays so if you take a lot of vacation this isnt the job for you.
good,"i absolutely loved working here amazing people and awesome managers, truly some of the best people ive worked with in my life, they also threw parties if the workers did well on there monthly reviews it was a great enviornment"
good,"Working at Regal is alot of fun. You get to see free movies and get free movie posters. The pay isn't great, but the people are super friendly and its a relaxing place to work."
good,"I overall like the friendly employees I get to work with everyday. They are always smiling and joking around to keep the workplace a fun friendly environment. "
good,This job was a lot of hard work and it was a full day of work. My co-workers were just crazy. They all had funny personalities and great to work with. I enjoyed working with them everyday. A typical day was filing samples away and unloading the truck at the end of the business day.
good,"Typical work day:Pretty fast pace depending on what movie was out"
good,This is a great first time job. Very fun and laid back. You work with at least 5 people at a time but I am very easy going so I get along with everyone.
good,its very easy. co workers are very nice. management is very understanding. they teach you everything you need to know. the only thing that kind of sucks is if its not busy you will get sent home really early.
good,"Really enjoyed being here was always a good vibe in the building and that's what i look for in a working environment . My co-workers were just amazingly  supportive and always made each other feel needed ,  this job taught me a lot with customer service skills and as well as management."
good,"I enjoy the people I work wih and love working at this theatre. Sometimes customers can be mean, but that is just apart of working in customer service. I have learned great skills here."
good,i really enjoy working here its a fun environment staff great to work with great benefit. fast past atmosphere great food wonderful movies
good,"A typical day at work was getting there, and immediately getting put on a register and having customers come to you to give you their order but also talk to you about the movie they are watching or are going to watch. It was a fun environment getting paid to interact with people and hear their reviews on certain movies. Not only were the crew members a blast, so were the costumers. The managers always made sure to interact with us and help us when needed, they never gave us a hard time for needing assistance more than once and would take the time to teach us the proper way of doing something. I think the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to joke and have a fun interaction with our costumers, about movies, the snack food, and the photo booth, going into work was never a bore for me."
good,Hollywood 18 is a wonderful place to work.  They are willing to work with your schedule.  Almost everyone there is happy to be there.  The managers are very knowledgeable and great to work with.  I always enjoy going to work here.
good,"Customers come in waves, based on showtimes, so I'd often have long breaks during a shift. Summer hours are the busiest, when kids are out of school. My coworkers were all generally in the same age group."
good,"Working here was fun I must say. You get to meet different people and they are very nice and friendly. Managers are very nice and help you get extra hours. A typical day at work will be on the cash register, clean, do inventory to fill up your station. I would had laughs with coworkers and thats about it."
good,I had many respondsibilties while working with Regal but all consist of customer care and maintaing clean work area. Upgrading sales and making customer feeling appreciated and satisfied with their purchases. Working with Regal has tought me the value of patience and the importance time management. The most enjoyable part of the job was watching movies while breaking and meeting sale quota. The hardest was pushing sales.
good,it a good place to work and i learned more about organizing my time
good,All of my co-workers were amazing to work with. We all worked as a team to get the job done.  My managers were always great and willing to work with my schedule when needed. The best part of my job was getting to meet new people everyday.
good,"Regal Cinemas offers the best job environment you could ask for. Including THE best customer service training in the nation. There was never a day where I didn't want to go to work at Regal. Everything I've learned and who I am as an employee I owe to the General Manager and District Manager of the Regal theater I worked for. You receive great management, quality customer service, flexibility, a fast paced friendly environment, working with a team, and the best training available for customer service. I recommend working for Regal for people with zero experience to people with years of experience and many qualifications."
good,• Provided safety as well as a clean environment for customers.
good,I like all of my managers. Ushers clean the theaters after they let out. We also keep stock and help customers if they need help.
good,An amazing company to work for. you will make friends that will last you for a life time. Worst mistake I made was thinking the grass was greener on the other side.
good,"This was my first job very easy to catch on to and advance in. The managers were great and so were the employees, everyone lgot along and drama was at a minimum. Highly recommend this company to first time job seekers."
good,"I love working here, I just need more money for my time and efforts while I sort through some personal life issues needing a lot more money than I can get working only there."
good,"Working for REG you can enjoy free movies year round! I loved working for this company. It's really like a family, most everyone has worked there for many years. They offer a temporary ""pool"" and hire or transfer from within, great opportunity for advancement once you get your foot in the door."
good,I highly enjoyed working here however the hours were minimal and I needed to work more in order to afford my apt and bills and anything else I may need.
good,"Regal has continuously helped me achieve my person skills and hone communication among guests and fellow employees. There isn't a day on the job that isn't fun and everyone, including the managers, are there to help you succeed and help staff achieve customer and self success."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the regal Old Mill 16. Everyone was extremely positive and worked very well as a team. I moved up quickly, and would recommend this job to anybody who wants a fun, and enjoyable experience."
good,"It was extremely face-paced, especially when new, popular movies came out. Excellent teamwork and communication. One thing I learned, was the acronym ""LAST"". It stands for Listen, Apologize, Solve, and Thank. It's the ideal way to approach a guest that has an issue."
good,"Wonderful job, been at since I was 17 i’ll Be 23 soon. Great PART TIME job & the benefits you couldn’t ask for more. I would love to advance through your the company but who knows.... again FREE movies can’t beat that :)"
good,I started this job when I was 16 so as a first job it was very welcoming. I worked here for 3.5 years and learned a lot throughout those years. I loved everything about the job and often miss it and the people I worked with
good,This one of the best first job I had. I was in high school still so to me that was the best thing that ever happened to me. I could walk there is needed and free movies tickets every day was awesome
good,Regal is a great place to get job experience. Managers genuinely want to see employees do well. Free movie tickets and discounted concessions are some cool benefits!
good,I love Regal with all my heart and soul. The people that I’ve worked with have been absolutely amazing. I enjoyed every minute while working there. There was hard days and Easy days but every minute of it was worth it.
good,"It is a good place to work, I learned a lot from Regal and have continued to advance and learn with new technology. I will be able to take my leadership skills and apply them in the future."
good,The job entailed ushering as well as concession stand.  I had to be quick in serving customers who were waiting to see a movie.  I had to clean the theatres after each movie.
good,"If you're a college student, or just love movies, working for regal is the way to go if you don't mind sacrificing your weekends and holidays for the company."
good,"I first started at the theatre in 1989, I greatly enjoyed working there, I left in 1992, due to transportation problems. After the office was moved, it was quite  a distance to get to and from work. When I went back to work in 2000, it was very close to my home. I really enjoyed every day. I got to know my co-workers and I really enjoyed helping the customers ."
good,"Fun and energetic place to work, the company does care about its employees. Managers are fun and kinda goofy but in a good way, coworkers are nice and fun to work with"
good,Regal Entertainment Group offers flexible availability while pursuing other career advancements either within or outside the company. They are fare when it comes to keeping a policy towards all guests and employees. There is no favoritism. The theater is ran under tight control.

good,"I honestly only stopped working at Regal because I moved. I loved everything about working there- from the culture to the fast paced, exciting environment. I was always staying up with current movies and topics to discuss with our customers and always making sure I was giving my best service to each guest, the managers were fun and great to work with."
good,Job can get fast-paced at times. Teamwork id at an all time high. The employees are generally nice and easy going. Theres always something to do even in the downtime.

good,Regal entertainment has been a very great job for me. It helped me became a much more confident employee and also has a great environment to work at. There tends to be enough down time there so I get to learn new things and also a lot of helpful employees that will make sure I am able to do the job correctly. Highly recommend working here.
good,Regal is an amazing place to work. its fast paced and energetic the staff and management are amazing. they allow you to move up quickly. would reccoment anyone to work here
good,I got the job when I was 16 and worked there up till I was 18/graduated from high school. Its a fun first job you have to be fast especially when it comes to the food stand and you meet awesome regular customers who come see the movies and who like standing in your line. It had its diffcult moments of course but over all it was a good job
good,"Repetitive fast paced environment. Growth is possible, My attendance was exceptional so I was able to move around with in the company to gain hands on experience to further my knowledge in customer service management."
good,"This can be a very fast-paced job.  The concessions are can get very busy.  When not busy helping guest then you need to clean to keep the work are looking good for guests.  The usher is constantly on the move either cleaning the auditoriums, bathrooms or hallways and doing auditorium checks to make sure the lighting, sound and movie are all working properly.  The management is great and my co-workers are excellent people to work with."
good,"A typical day at Regal Cinemas depends on what day it is, like the weekdays such as Monday-Wednesday can be slow or steady at times. It mainly depends on if kids are on breaks for holidays/ summer break etc. Now Thursday-Sunday, that's when the business gets super busy and at times it can be stressful but its super fun to see all sorts of people come here to see movies or even have birthday parties! I have learned multiple things since working here, such as how to handle situations where there are people who want to plan birthday parties, making sure that the auditorium looks just like it did before. I've also handled money and cards before. Hardest part of my job prob would be cleaning, because sometimes its really messy but as a team we all work together and get it all done. The best part of my job is helping customers with their needs and seeing them come out of the movie and ask me if Ive seen it yet or when they come out smiling!"
good,Very fun place to work! Management is great and there are a lot of opportunities for advancement. Great benefits such as free movies and discounted concessions.
good,A typical day at work includes cleaning up trash after a movie has ended or selling tickets at box office. I've learned information about the film industry and how many people are required to complete a film. Management knows how to handle any situation and the co-workers are consistently pleasant. The hardest part of this job is stopping teenagers from sneaking into rated R movies. The most enjoyable part of this job is cleaning the theaters.
good,"As a cast member for my local Regal theatre, I would clean, help customers, handle money, and prepare food. Management was super friendly and helpful whenever you needed advice or help. The hardest part was lifting the heavy inventory bags on occasion. The most enjoyable part of the job, was talking with customers."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers. the hardest part of the job was cleaning up after the customers. over all the job was fun.
good,"The work is simple and straight forward, but if there is any confusion someone is always willing to help. The managers are very nice, friendly, and see to it that all is well and safe."
good,Fantastic place to work. They accommodate any situation. The work with most availabilities. Great place to start and build reliable work ethics.
good,"Words will never begin to describe the love I have for regal cinemas. This being my first serious job, I went in afraid yet eager to learn. We go through a two day of training, simply watching videos and then shadowing other employees to figure out how the flow of the theater works. This job has taught me so much in the mere year I had worked there. Customers were either difficult to the point where you wanted to scream at them, or the nicest people you would have ever met. I learned to assess the conflict and step back before I lost my temper and to look at things in a more logical sense. My co-workers were probably the best part of this job. We all got along great and were constantly together outside of work hours."
good,"I LOVED THIS JOB. The teenagers worked well together. The job had me switching duties everyday, so it made it interesting.  I enjoyed talking to the patrons."
good,A typical day at work wasnt to slow or to busy untill it got closer to Haloween. I learned allot of good work habets and that it was a great first job choice to develop skills. Management was alright tho sometimes strangely hard to find. Co-workers where great they helped me allot when they found out it was my first job. There wasnt realy any hard parts except for keeping kids under controle at the bounce house and keeping them away from the ponys as we led them to and from the pin. the best part of the job was working with the guests but the Greatest part was working with the ponys because i have a big heart for animals.
good,"Mostly everyday I was assigned usher, I learned to work at a fast pace, gain valuable experience, good team work, everything was mangement very well, co-workers were very helpful. The hardest part of this job was switching positions frequently on busy days. The most enjoyable part of the job was connecting with the co-workers."
good,My time so far at Regal has been awesome. Everyone is very nice and they work great with my schedule!
good,Learned how to handle money. Learn hot to interact with a lot of people. learned hot to work faster. co-workers were great.
good,"A typical day at work usually consisted of a fast paced environment of assisting customers and cleaning auditoriums, through this kind of setting I was able to learn how to work with a team on a timed schedule. Our managers were great when it came to helping those when needed and were reasonable when coming to adjusting work schedules. My co-workers were very supportive and dependable when it came down to splitting up the work to clean several auditoriums at once. The hardest part about my job was pushing out the dumpster after it was filled up since it was sometimes a one man job. The most enjoyable part of my job was being talking with the customers on what movies they saw and sharing the experience and also getting to know their point of view on things."
good,"This company treats it's employees well, the job is fun, and there is always growth potential."
good,Love an entertainment vibe! Excellent workplace to build customer service experience and also to learn multi-tasking as well as being well organized.
good,"I learned a great deal with my two years with this company. Within 6 months I was promoted to associate manager. Not much longer after that, I was promoted to full time associate manager. I developed an amazing sense of customer service. Though that was the most difficult thing to work with. Handling each situation was a new and different experience. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and the employees I managed. If I could still be there, I would be."
good,Helping Customers enjoy a wonderful experience at the movies.
good,This was one of the best places i have ever worked at. My co workers were like my best friends. The customers that would come in where wonderful and very friendly. The management was very easy to get along with. Everything about this jobs was enjoyable.
good,"A typical day at Regal, was very relaxing sometimes hectic but nothing too extreme or hard to handle"
good,"I was an Associate Manager. I Held various positions within the theatre environment: as Key Holder, full of Customer Service, Concessions, Projection, Box Office, Usher, Handled large amounts of currency, Book Keeper, Stock, Inventory, Promotions, and Employee Supervision. Loved the movies. There was no hard part i was so used to doing everything it came natural."
good,"Would take care of the customers as they came in and would make sure the theaters were clean, I did alot of cash handling between concession and ticket sales and also cooked the food."
good,a typical day at work involved inappropriate bullying from fellow co-workers however the managers are great and accepting of everyone and tried to putan end to it as best they could. I learned a lot while working here especially since it was my first job.
good,A good job for high school student. The coworkers are very nice. It’s really fun to be around them. The managers are extremely friendly. They try their best to keep the employees happy and safe. I wouldn’t quit at all. This job is probably the coolest job ever.
good,I love working at Regal Cinemas. It has flexible hours and good benefits! Working for regal cinemas is fantastic! Great employees and managers! I love working at Regal Cinemas!
good,That’s it good but sometimes it just hard the money your get bi-weekly and it very nice the customers are very fun the kids are happy to go to the movies everyday

good,this job happened to be my very first job in which I enjoyed so much. it was the greatest experience for me because it was introduced through the actual program equipped to helping me find a job and providing sources such as help with training in retail and customer service as well as help with my resume. the movie theater was brand new so all of the employees were the first crew to come in and  start in the grand opening business. it was fun and always busy so there was always something to do plus the place was humongous with management on site.

I learned that no matter what you do that day whether it's ushering, concessions, door or box... your job will be fun. The staff at Regal is so funny and awesome to work with. In my opinion my favorite part of my job was working in concessions. i loved dealing with customers face to face and interacting with them on a daily basis. Working there i made friends and lots of regular customers that see me whenever they come to the movies. The most enjoyable part of my job was not only did i get great hours but i also got called in a lot and i would get excited to see my work calling. I was always getting called in to work and i absolutely loved it.  I think the hardest part of my job was having to play more than just concessions, having to be an usher too. Also being in Box Office. Overall it was a great life experience and i would do it again in a heartbeat."
good,"I have been employed by Regal Entertainment Group since 2002. I have loved every minute that I have worked for this amazing company. No, every day is not a party.

The amount of care they put into making sure each guest receives the best experience of every visit is awesome. I am so proud to be a Regal Entertainment Group employee."
good,"my typical day at work consisted of manage over my staff of anywhere from 10-20 people because I was a concession stand supervisor and I had to schedule breaks make sure I had enough staff and everything stocked for each show setting. I learned great leadership skills, how to manage a team without being too over bearing and how to be a leader that my staff feels comfortable to come discuss any matter going on with but also don't forget your their boss and not just a friend so had to remember to remain a leader figure. management staff and coworkers were all excellent to work with . the hardest part about my job was maintaining everything as well as we did and make sure everyone was satisfied. the most enjoyable part about my job was having a excellent staff to back me up and be on point the majority of the time."

good,"Was a wonderful place to work at. Had a lot of fun with my coworkers and learning bout the movie industry. Typical day would consist of, making sure work area is clean and tidy. Making sure customers that come in are directed accordingly. There was not any hard part about the job at all, I rather enjoyed it when we were really busy."
good,"nice easy day at work "
good,Not much to do at this job but check theaters and help costumers. I learned patience at this job. Management kept us on a flowing and helpful manner. My co-workers were all pleased with this job. Hardest part were dealing with rambunctious costumers. The most enjoyable was getting free movie tickets.
good,"A typical day at work can be a little stressful, but all in a good day's work.Everybody is amazing in the working environment and there are 4 managers that will make sure you are doing the job right and will help you when needed. The General Manager is also a fair person where shifts and working progress is concerned. The hardest part of the job would have to be the swiftness needed in order to go through the day and make every customer satisfied, but as said earlier: ""All in a good day's work"". The most enjoyable part of the job is that it is not just about the work involvement and positions, but also knowing that everybody that works with you is like family. I have never had any problems with any of the employees or employers whatsoever. What I learned from this company as a basic job, is that you have to put in the effort in order to achieve success in life. Everywhere, even in dreams that a person would like to come true have to make the effort in order to make those dreams happen."
good,"Working for Valley River Center Regal Cinema 15 & IMAX is a great place to work. Being able to work at a movie theatre was a great opportunity for me. I was young and it was a great first job, being able to help people (customers) have a great experience because you never know what someone is going through, was always a great feeling."
good,"A typical day would be to work where was needed.  My assignment varied from Concession, to Lobby Attendant, Selling tickets, taking tickets or cleaning the Theaters before and after each show."
good,"The company does as much if not more business in the 2-3 months for the Holiday season as the rest of the year. The holiday season is very hectic and needs an employee, such as myself, who can handle stress. I deal with customers on the phone and through email. The most enjoyable part of this job is the amazing employee care that Regal provides. The hardest part of the job is accomplish all tasks at the busy peak in the year. There are only 4 total employees, including myself to get everything to run smoothly."
good,"At Regal I cleaned theaters, collected tickets,made popcorn and drinks, took out trash, and also a cashier."
good,Everyone was awesome to work with! Everyone helped everyone out. Great job for a high school with little to no customer service experience. They will help you to gain that skill!
good,Days at NCG were enjoyable.  Quite possibly the best company Ive worked for.
good,"Awesome staff and great management. "
good,"•	Retained the flow of business"
good,"A typical day for me at Regal is mostly speaking with and helping customers enjoy a movie. I learned how to keep calm in certain situations, especially if customers aren't happy with the service they are receiving. I try my best to help them in any way I can and direct them to someone else if I cannot help them any further. I've grown to like my managers and co-workers a lot and I think I learned a lot from all of them. The most enjoyable part to me is when I get a thank you from a customer. It lets me know that I did my job and they were satisfied with how I treated them. The hardest part to me was getting to know everyone. It took me a while to adjust to working with so many people, but I learned quickly how enjoyable it is to be surrounded with fun, happy people while you work."
good,"Typical work day: Clean the theaters take out the trash, check the theaters, and rip the tickets, prepare food, and clean the concession area."
good,A typical work day would be me coming into work and knowing what I would be doing for the day. Regal is very orderly and every employee is aware of their position for a specific day. Every employee knows what the duties are for their position. From my job with Regal Cinemas I have learned great customer service skills. The management there is excellent. The hardest part of the job is that a employee might have to deal with a hostile customer once in a while.

I also enjoy the benefits such as half off on concessions, free movie tickets and so forth. Another thing i enjoy most is when i go away to college and go on school leave, i can always come back and continue to work for them when i return from school."
good,"My responsibilities included training box office operators to sell tickets, up-sell gift certificates, and be courteous, polite, and efficient."
good,"A typical day at work is just interacting with many costumers, and cleaning up any mess throughout a shift. I have learned how to interact with other people and how important it is to look your best because I as a worker represent the company. Management at Regal Cinemas is great, everyone is very professional and understanding. My co-workers are very fun and energetic which makes it a very positive environment for everyone. The hardest part of the job is being very fast and with the food. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing family's faces when they see the delicious popcorn they get."

I learned a lot about customer service and how to calm down a disgruntled customer. I learned how to answer phones and to multitask quite often. Started to show that I can manage well. I loved coming into work every time. The hardest part about this job was movie premiers. I worked off site as well to promote movies. This was a great job.
good,"Serve Popcorn, hot dogs, slushes, sodas, nachos, candy,"
good,A normal day at regal ENT was when we had every screen on track with no complaints. The management set good examples for myself and many of my co-workers. The hardest part of this job was asking a person to leave the building..

good,"I have worked at Regal for almost 5 years. I have had countless secondary jobs but I love working at regal. Things there can get hectic at time, just like with all jobs, but when it is slow it is a very relaxing environment. Management there is also very nice and understanding. Overall, it is a great place to work and i would recommend it to everyone looking for a first time job or a simple secondary job."
good,"Regal theaters in general must have come around quite a bit since 2006.  My location is gorgeous and clean, and all others in the Knoxville area are kept in clean condition.  Some theaters are fancier than others, but all are well-maintained.  The prices are high, but this is true for any movie theater in 2009.  Regal Entertainment Group offers theaters that show popular movies, IMAX and 3D locations, locations with arcades and birthday party accommodations, and theaters that show independent films.  The chain is fabulous and professional"
good,"Typical day: Cleaned movie theaters, served food to customers, directed customers to designated theaters."

good,best job ever!!! i loved my experience. no bad reviews great team great management and a blast to help people.
good,"Opening the cash register in the morning I would start with counting both the money and the concession items. I was responsible for the distribution of tickets and concessions. My managers were a great influence and helpful role models. I was very happy to have worked for this company because it gave me not only outstanding costumer service experience, but also the opportunity to have a very professional yet friendly relationship with both my co-workers and my managers. The hardest part of the day was in-between sets when there was a lull. Taking advantage of this down-time I was able complete small tasks. The most enjoyable part of my job was pleasing the costumers. I loved receiving compliments about my never ending smile."
good,"A typical work day would start with washing my hands, then logging into my cash resgister and counting my draw and confirm count with manager. Then I would check my station and make sure it is fully stock with cups, popcorn bags, and candy. I continuously made popcorn while I served our guests at my station. After a ends day of work I would clean out my station, count my draw and check with manager to clock out."
good,This was a fantastic place to work. I stayed part time for over 6 years. I started in High School and stayed until my senior year at The Ohio State University. I learned to get along with people of all ages and discover the different work ethics of people and how I wished to display my self.

good,A typical monday to thursday is slow and easy going. Friday to sunday on the other hand is our busy days were to monday. What I have learn from there is that customes service is the number one thing we have to keep up. Management is always on top of things and make sure that the movies are up and running.What can i say about my co-workers is that they are like my second family. The hardest things about the job is that when we close is that we have to make sure that we have everything ready for the next morning.The most enjoyable part about the job is the co-workers because without them the job wouldn't be a job.
good,"I like working there because I was in charge of managing and training personnel, responsible for inventory, controlling storages, and accounting needs for every items"
