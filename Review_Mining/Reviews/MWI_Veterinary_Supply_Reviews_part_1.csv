bad,The mangers and leads only favorite those who are lazy and don't want to work. The people who works their hardest and butts off gets no attention. They rather treat the lazy ones good and the good ones bad. What I don't like about this work place is because they don't respect you and your culture. Look down on you. Always hiding in their offices behind closed doors. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work here.
bad,"This warehouse is one of the most un organized, poorly managed places I will ever work at in my entire life."
bad,Mandatory over time . Management WORST!  They play favorite on employees. One ex cop think he God. Employees TURN OVER HUGE ! 12 hours a day off 2am  .
bad,"Long days."
bad,"poor need more balances glad to be away from there over barring"
bad,"I worked for this company for 4 years and I've watched it changed from a good place to work a horrible place to work, the management does not help you out they treat you more like they're running a daycare and they're babysitting you they don't show appreciation to their employees. when you go to work you never know what time you're going to get off you could start at 7 in the morning and get off at 10 o'clock that night they don't care if you have to come back the next morning at 7 AM.The best part about this company is some of their employees that's the only reason why I stuck it out so long but everybody that's coming from California is changing the mwi Denver To how they do it in Visalia."
bad,"A woman nightmare!! Management is so afraid of men that he hires more females than males. He loves drama and strives off it. This man actually creates drama so he can sit back and watch on all of his hidden cameras he has all over the warehouse. He plays favorites big time and if you're not his spy then watch out. If you have a excellent work ethic and you care about the customers then you don't want to work here. Pay is horrible, the reviews are horrible and if you get an increase it won't be much. If he has a problem with you he will work your head off while the rest of the women gossip."
bad,"This job is only good for a head start in life, however , it is not a good place to work long time. Favoritism is at an all time high when working for this company so if you ever get hired here it is better to be on your p's and q's."
bad,Just over work u and treat u bad manger are not supportive and brakes are not called on time not worth it should be paid like $19 hr for that job never again
bad,"Workplace culture was different than I was use to.  I loved making sales calls to the Veterinary Hospitals in Western, NY.  There is a lot of management layers with in the company than what I was use to."
bad,This jobs hours at horrible and the management sucks. Would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"Working for MWI is a very unappreciated experience.  Leadership does not care about the employees,  and other than age requirements can be equated to sweatshops. Overtime is a good thing when sought out although when forced on an everyday basis it destroys motivation and appeal. The entire program needs to be restarted from the ground up. Many employees are constantly unhappy and looking for new places to work but only hold on to pay the bills. There is a serious lack of communication and is very poorly planned. Take care of your people and they will take care of you."
bad,"You knew what time you were starting work, but never knew when you would be done.  I learned alot about warehousing there, but the management team was always fighting amongst each other."
bad,"Strong Work Ethic, dedicated to job and company.  Goes beyond the expected."
bad,I have not liked this company since I was recruited to go to this company from another company and have regretted my decision to leave the other company ever since.
bad,"The supervisors/leads there are extremely unprofessional.  I've witnessed on  several occasions management ""blasting"" employees in front of their peers.  They would also stand in groups at the end of the work areas or by the picking desk and talk about employees whom they didn't care for.  It was made into an extremely stressful environment for no reason at all. "
bad,"At times it was a good place to work. "
bad,"I hear great things about other locations of this company & how their location is a ""great place to work"" but as a current employee at MWI Whitestown, IN I'd say put the brakes on before you consider employment here. It use to be a great place until new management came in and started running employees out the door nd the building to the ground before the expansion is complete. Management comes across as not caring about their employees, their thoughts, concerns, input, health or safety. Instead of making the customer #1 priority and jumping in to help meet deadlines (after running employees out the door making us short staffed) management sit in their office all day either conversating or looking for ways to harass employees on FMLA leave. -No TEAM work at this location, its sad because employees are starting not to care, if management doesn't then what gives them the drive to. Somewhere I read ""There is no greater investment a company can make than in it's employees"", I wish I worked at one of these other MWI locations I hear about & who knows how long this location will last without good, happy, dedicated employees who enjoy coming to work."
bad,Company salary did not compensate for the daily work responsibilities. Employee morale was low with no career opportunities. Would not recommend this company if you are looking for career advancement.
bad,I work 5 days a week at 10-12 hours per day. I learned that the Veterinary business is very demanding. My co-workers and I worked very well as a team each day.  I found that learning a new scale system was the hardest part about becoming a employee of MWI. The most enjoyable part of the job at MWI was getting to know and interact with new people.
good,It was long hours poor management and not very understanding I was in a wreck on the way to work and needed medical care and they were just worried about how soon I couk d get in
good,MWI  offer  good  benefits  but  the  promotions don't  really exist. The  don't  value the  employees that  work  for  them. So if  you just  looking  for  a job is  great but  if  you want  more  you might want to work some place else.
good,"I usually don't leave comments about jobs, honestly cause they are never good, I don't want it to leave a bad name for the company then people aren't going to want to work there. So I like people to experience the work environment for themselves and not just off of mine."
good,Employees were never sure of what time we would be going home on a daily basis. Every work day ended at a different time. We as employees learned to adapt due to needing the job but it wasn't good for our home life.
good,It would be an alright job if management was better.  The pay is alright. You're always doing other peoples work. They're constantly changing start times.
good,"buying material to stock warehouses, not enough training or tribal knowlege pass down.  Managers are not top notch.  Healthcare costs were good, but pay was terrible."
good,"Started off a wonderful place to work the longer I worked their the worse it seemed. Advancement requires cross training between many tasks in the warehouse but cross training was rarely done outside of picking and packing. I'm well above the standard for advancement to Team Member II but management gives fluffy empty excuses as to why they won't allow me to advance. On top of that corporate, not the management of the warehouse themselves, tends to pull some shifty moves such as hiring new people with zero experience for two dollars more than current working employees, many of which put in a lot of effort to get the job done as quickly as possible. Overall the place is a decent place to work if you need some warehouse experience and will open doors to other more lucrative jobs if you can convince management to train you in specific skills."
good,"The packing was stress free and fairly easy. There were a lot of women there so i had to handle all the heavy stuff which, realistically, wasn't heavy at all. The management was very laid back. They would let us listen to a little bit of music while packing. It wasn't a lot of room to move around or up but it was ok. "
good,"A typical day of work consisted of making sure orders were picked in the correct order based on delivery times.One thing I have learned while working there is always make sure you keep your composure while you are on the work floor."
good,"Stacking Boxes to pallets, plastic wrapping them to load in separate trucks, organize boxes and pallets and put in correct loading area. keep warehouse clear of debris, hardest part was long Mondays when the orders come in from the weekend."
good,if you like working for a place that for three years will give you the same pay as new employees. even though the work lode is completely different. people are friendly but management will favor employees. promised compensation for above average work never did if you like spending your hole week at a warehouse and having weekends off this is a job for you.
good,"Overall I have somewhat enjoyed working at this company. Depending on where you work, normally there is NO avenue for advancement. The company was bought out by ABC, and since then there are all kinds of new systems and requirements that are being implemented and they are turning the company into more of a generic place to work. Everyone below the executive level is starting to feel like more of a peon or a number then an actual team member. But hey, its a job and it pays the bills, right?"
good,A great place to work for short term and earn a salary to maintain a lifestyle. Earned experience with forklift driving and inventory work.
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in at one p.m, picking and packing over 3000 pet supplies preparing them for shipment with twenty other team members and three managers. We take a forty five minute break and leave one to two a.m. The hardest part of the job was standing on my feet for ten to twelve a day."
good,High turn over rate hard for advancement within the company
good,"Skills"
good,it was a good place to work. everyone worked good together we pushed each other when needed and helped just as much. they were willing to teach u other jobs if u were interested.
good,"Start time was 11.00 and you went home when they said you could. They have no 8 hours just all over time, plus you payed regular for over time. Managment does not know its people or there potential."
good,"review summary, this was a pleasant place to work, good co-workers and management. i enjoyed working here just wish the pay was higher and that there ould be more room for growth from wthin"
good,"pack boxes,restock boxes and gen. cleaning. good pay. nice people.Very long hours.my manager was very nice.I enjoy working there a lot.I learned a lot"
good,"There is quite a bit of behind the scenes. Decisions by management are sprung upon employees without reason or notice. Production metrics need a median, not based on an entire shift when an individual is place amongst various depts. throughout the day. This has placed a low morale & self confidence when you work hard all day and all you are is a number."
good,"I enjoyed working at mwi, I learned the different products for each anima. I handled a lot of the paperwork for the receiving side of the company. I processed all the paperwork and enjoyed doing so."
good,Innovative and progressive. They are trying to be the best in the industry with up to date technology. A good place to learn about the how a distributor works from the ground up
good,"MWI is a warehouse environment with fast pace, and volume production. Expect 8 to 13 hour shifts, the satisfaction of helping take care of animals' health, and making a difference in the world. I learned a wide variety of skill sets in all areas of operation. Working with a diverse range of  people and cultures to get the job done in a proficient manner is an important part of this job. Picking, packing, shipping, loading trucks, and inventory operation are some of the many different tasks that you might be set with in this job."
good,"This job is based in productivity , and you need to be very efficient, you work with medicine and supplies for veterinarian."
good,"Arrived to check roster , to see what my duty was for the day, could be pic , pack , or be in receiving. I learned how to run pick ticket printer , and to keep a steady flow of work going. Management was difficult to get along with , I dont believe any employee should be yelled at in front of their co-workers. My co-workers are a great part of the team , hard working group , fun to be around. The hardest part of the job was knowing I would have to face my boss. The most enjoyable part was being able to listen to My Seahawks if I had to work."
good,"A typical day at Mwi was fun energetic,casual work environment management team was excellent with workers, some days will be long and demanding but worth it at the end of the day, pay is decent overall a great place to work"
good,Numerous cut-off times to get shipments out the door. I have learned to use AS400 software. The management is very fair. My co-workers care about meeting deadlines. The hardest part is being on my feet 10-12 hours a day. The most enjoyable part is people treating me like family.
good,"the hardest part of my job was to keep up and move fast. Otherwise people I worked with were helpful and friendly. There was a chance for advancement, if you moved fast. I didnt like that part I felt there were more mistakes made when forced to hurry."
good,I enjoy the people and stagf i worked with. I enjoued maybe not at the precise time but learning things ans hearing different ideas of other employees
good,It’s a great job and i learned a lot of things and they have been able to make me a better person to be able to take care of my family was so much better than I ever experienced
good,"I was hired as a temp worker and enjoyed what I was tasked to do. There was about an hour of training with an experienced full time worker, and then we were set to work alone. Good people, good management."
good,"I've been with the company for nearly two years and have had (so far) a good experience. They look for employees who have a certain drive, and those employees are the ones who get to move up with the company.  As long as you are pulling your own weight, show enthusiasm and arrive on time you will go far. A good attitude is a must with this place!"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of going to appointments I had previously setup for myself.  I drove around North Carolina going to existing clients and promoting the online services of MWI. I trained veterinary staffs on how to use the online services as well as helped with inventory management, and optimizing their time spent ordering supplies.  I helped increase the percentage of internet sales in my territory during my internship."
good,My brother in law passed away. My mother in law took his passing hard. I had no choice but to move back to Michigan. If mwi had a wearhouse here in Michigan. I would have tried to transfer to it.
good,"Start work around 8am pick a stack of orders and a scan gun then go pick the orders.When I picked the pile of orders,then I would go to a pack area and pack them."
good,I worked part time here and I really enjoyed it and the people I worked with.  It was a fast pace job which that is something I like. The supervisors were pretty fair and the hardest part of the job was the crunch times when we had to get certain trucks out at a certain time.
good,"better hours, I enjoyed working at mwi steady work, great benefits,cool management who don""t mind working.Great employees bonus"
good,I purchase vet supplies daily in the thousands of dollars. I kept a 98% service level. I loved negotiating prices with the vendors  and finding new products needed by vets.
good,"Really easy place to work with hardworking co-workers, everyone gets along very well. Schedule very flexible for family matters."
good,Typical day at work very fun and productive. What i learned in was about chemicals. My co-workers we get along very well. The hardest part of my job was nothing. The most enjoyable part of the job the people and the management team.
good,9-5 during the week with occasional weekend conferences and programs.  Good atmosphere with a family like mentality.  Lower on the salary end but higher on the commision end.
good,"Learned a lot, worked from home, boss rode with about every other month.  Called on veterinary clinics.  Was able to furnish clinics from start to finish"
good,I learn the as400 system and to pick and pack parts the right way and fast to beat the time frame we had on a daily basics. Learn the shipping part of the as400 system.
good,"• Administered time management skills in meeting with various clients"
good,"My day was filled with sending emails, logging faxes and speaking with veterinarians to verify prescriptions for their patients. I learned a great deal about the different medical treatments for all animals. I enjoyed my coworkers a great deal, but the management was not as enjoyable."
good,"Can't say enough about the senior leadership, particularly the Executive Team members. Superior go to market strategies underscored by a terrific culture."
good,I always have a good time with this company I go to work with a smile on my face everyday.
good,Loved everything about this company and position.  Great communication between team members.  Opportunity to learn everything about the veterinary market place.
good,"really enjoyed the work, the people the hours were very very long. you would come in around 9 or 10 and would not leave until the last truck was packed and left."
good,It was the best place to work the pay was good for what I did and the customers we're always happy to see me bring there products everyone got the velvet glove treatment..
good,Great company to work for. I got to learn a lot about the different aspects of the company. So many different positions to work for here.  I would recommend this job.
good,MWI is a very family orientated company. A company that grows each and every year. Benefits are great as well as  vacation and PTO are nice to have...
good,I loved this job but sadly it was relocated to Shakopee MN.  In my time there I made a ton of new friends that I still keep in touch with after being gone for over 4 years now.
good,"Pack orders"
good,During the moment of working with this particular company; I worked in customer service by organizing pick ticket items to the successfully process customer's orders within the shipping deadlines. I also worked with data entry by receiving and processing products from various vendors.
good,I was always told what a good job I was doing and that they were thankful I enjoyed my job. They gave you the good points you were doing as well as the bad points. Not a negative place to work. They were very productive.
