rating,review
bad,"I wasn't given the chance to take any training. Despite this, the management expected me to deliver since day two."
bad,"This company is full of millennial's that swear that they are entitled to what ever. And don't let me get started on the Executive Assistants there. They are indeed a couple that are the nicest. But the majority of them, swear they are the VPs of the company. Really? These are only secretaries with a higher position and they enjoy throwing their weight around. Karma is something and when they get their walking papers, they'll see... They have this application which is horrible, Go To Meeting and Go to Webinar. Their network just sucks and this past March, they had a security breach which affected the company and many others world wide. Every year they go through this lay-off off process which puts a majority of the  folks in a stressful situation. Oh and btw, if you don't belong to a clique' in this office (Ft, Lauderdale), you're basically in outsider. I used to dread going to work there because of the atmosphere that it transpired. I will never ever see Citrix the same again. For me, its not a place that you can grow or better yet be a part of. If I hear anyone wanting to wok for this mediocre company, I will make it my point to talk them out of it! That's my story and I'm sticking to it!!!"
bad,"The whole structure of outbound calling, setting appointments up with the customer and then hoping the person that is doing the demo actually closes was not a good practice ever. If the Demo person was not  your friend, then they will put your appointment on the low end of the list and you miss out on sales. That is not good considering it is a commission base job."
bad,Not a good place to work. Environment very stressful. Managers always want more do not care about the worker. They only care about numbers and reports
bad,Citrix Systems lost there way. Management team is unsupportive. Contractors are not converted in a timely manner after doing the job function that is needed. Hoping that Citrix Systems will get back on track.
bad,The manager here talked to you as if you were not any one and he does not respect his workers. Not a good environment for some one to work in.
bad,"Citrix India - Bangalore customer service dept is the worst place to work at."
bad,I regret why did i wasted my valuable time in this org. You will be watched on what time you come in and you go out . It is like a manufacturing factory not a high tech company
bad,"Management is terrible and the employee surveys reflected such.  The culture is set up so that you can't implement change. No real rhyme or reason for promotions, they're given based on likability."
bad,"It was not by no means a facility maintenance tech job. More of a manual labor moving office equipment of sorts, furniture etc. from place to place. Barely using any tools for the job. Not looked upon well by office personnel throughout complex."
bad,"End of quarters were miserable.  They made you work very long hours, until midnight on the last day and 10-11 pm on other days leading up to it.  Including New Years Eve, they made us work until midnight.  No one was happy to be there.  The last two weeks of December were working late every night.  They didn't pay over time if there were holidays during the week, was regular hours."
bad,"Citrix gets a lot of praise for their culture and environment, but I found none of it to be true.  I saw immature sales management gossip about reps and promote them based on who they liked and who tried harder to be promoted rather than who had the skill to do the job.  I saw VP-level sales management threaten to ruin careers.  I saw Director-level sales management date the marketing team and have inappropriate friendships with the college hires.  I saw management try to make people work free overtime ""if they wanted to be promoted.""  Everything was watched and counted - including the number of times you got up from your desk to get a soda - and used against you in staffing reviews."
bad,"Scary. Stressful. Nightmare. No Security. Low Morale. Sad Employees. No Employee Engagement. No Direction. The culture used to be great, but not so much in the last 4 years. It's been a very stressful place to work. No job security. Only the top executives and their, wives, and friends can sleep at night with no worry of losing their job."
bad,Citrix has a few pros and cons like every place one works for. I would say overall Citrix is going through a transition phase. I really wish it comes out this phase a winner.
bad,"If you like being stabbed in the back by upper management. It doesnt matter what department you are in, they are all just as bad as the other. So keep that in mind."
bad,"How motivating is this? ""I suggest you pack your stuff as I might fire you today"" which I endured over and over day after day. All this manager cared about was his wallet and how he could squeeze you to make his wallet fatter."
bad,"Every 4 years or so, Citrix likes to slash a decent-sized amount from its workforce. The latest was in March 2014 when they deleted most of their senior management, especially in marketing. Apparently neither skills nor time invested in the company would save your job. In fact, the older you were, the more likely you were to face the hatchet. Ouch!"
bad,The company gets into its own way.  Great products but horrible company management.  They have been through several CEO's in the last few years.  Annual lay-offs are how they manage profitability.  People leadership is poor and so is morale.  Diversity employees quickly exit
bad,Lots of turnover in senior management. Slow to promote and put resources compare to competitors. Worst company I've been part of thus far in my life.
bad,Be likeable and give the managers the platform to continuously speak of themselves in your presence and you will be there for a very long time.  Its a favoritism game there
bad,"Lots of late hours and weekends during non close time frames.  The company promotes ""work from anywhere"" but employees have to be in the office to work late hours and weekends.  There is a feel that the hours are expected and we should be on call on weekends."
bad,I begin working with Citrix and it was an amazing experience in the beginning. As time passed it was obvious they were positioning themselves for a buy out. Perks were being cut and managers were leaving without being replaced. I would go in more detail but I think everyone reads the news and knows how this all went down.
bad,Hi Paced with a lot of requirements. People and team are great members are great to work with! IT department folks are great :) .
bad,"Citrix Systems does offer the ability to work from anywhere and does provide the ability to work with data center class technologies.  However, the CSM(client services managers) are overzealous during recruitment and are less than honest about work expectations."
bad,"Stressful workplace. Difficult for work and life balance."
bad,"It is a great place to work at. I learnt alott during my work at Citrix. I was give a chance to work on all the latest technologies like Azure, C# and automation."
bad,"Not a good company"
bad,"Still being run by majority of men, who have yet to see the value of a diversified team running their sales divisions. Management could use some cleaning out- some major liabilities still on the team."
bad,Citrix is being broken up and sold and everyone is in fear of their jobs.  It is a very tough time for a place that was great to work.
bad,"No thanks.  I don't have anything positive to say about working for Citrix.  Most aren't happy here and I was no exception.  They will pitch a work life balance, but you won't have one here, at least in sales.  You will get paid well, but you will work long hours and you will hate your manager."
bad,"Worked there 3 years and went through 4 rounds of layoffs. Ongoing rumors the company is being positioned for M&A. Used to be a great company to work for, but has steadily declined with changes to Executive Board, and focus on profitability. Overall moral is very low. Due to poor management and (seemingly deliberate) misinformation, Executive Management has lost the confidence of the rank and file."
bad,The company is going through a lot of change with the slip of the Mobility Apps services. Revenue expectations are such that most of the sales teams struggle to hit quota let alone exceed the.
bad,"It used to be a very different place to work but..."
bad,Citrix has been through so many re-orgs and process and product changes that the products have become unstable as a result
bad,"Citrix used to be a great company to work for years ago. Terrible management, politics, cut throat, and human resources is a nightmare. If you're lucky to be a 'chosen one"" there, count your blessings, but even then your job is never safe. Company has no loyalty to its employees."
bad,"Citrix has been taken over by accountants and has been trimmed down in an attempt to prepare for sale.  "
bad,"Fun and energetic place to work if your looking for a sales position.  Corporate headquarters is mainly an older campus. I'm not sure how they plan to attract young talent in this area.  Office design is very dated.  No clear vision for the company and the uncertainty trickles down to all levels of employees. Red tape across the departments makes day-to-day activities challenging."
bad,Good place to learn about new technologies and state of the art software solutions for new IT world. It is also losing its sheen as the management in India is not very supportive
bad,"Flexible"
good,"No direction, lack of management, rolling layofffs."
good,"Regional Sales Manager"
good,"Citrix Online was a great place to work in the beginning, but my schedule began to adversely effect my health. My schedule was 5am to 2pm and I was told it would be temporary until new techs were hired, but new techs kept being hired and the would not let me change my schedule even though I had been diagnosed ulcers. I begged my manager every week for months, and the sicker I became the more my performance and attendance suffered."
good,It is hard to move up in this company. They tend to promote their friends and work others to death. They really don't care about their employees.
good,"Citrix was a decent place to work for many years, but when competitors starting taking market share, and the product development team was behind the technology curve we lost many of our customer base. Unfortunately management did not acknowledge that, and they simply tightened the screws making the day to day life of their sales teams very stressful and the goals became unattainable.  Citrix was bought out by LogMeIn and I do not know how it is now."
good,"Nice people"
good,"What use to be a fun place to work, has now turned into a ""not so fun place to work"". "
good,Learned great ways to recruit and to sale cloud based solutions to various companies world wide.
good,"Best part of Citrix: no doubt the people you will work with. Great people who are incredibly down to earth. No one's putting on a false pretense. "
good,"Typical sales grind with a churn and burn mentality. You can always be replaced and many/most are. The down time is fun and snacks, games, party atmosphere is always at the ready. Consideration for the individual is minimal and there is only one path for growth."
good,3 CEO's in as many years.  Unrest among employees.  Many layoffs and changes.   Decisions are based on executive egos and their advancement.  Long time employees have no future.
good,"No Transparency, Regular Layoffs. I have been told that they plan to outsource IT. They have had regular layoffs for the last 2 years and they have an investment firm making all their decisions"
good,"Citrix is a good place to work if you are very competitive and self driven. For an inside sales you are expected to make at minimum 40 calls per day, create about 300k in pipeline and close at 100% of your quota. If you don't meet your quota, your can get in big trouble. The fun part about working at Citrix is because you learn a lot about technology, sales strategies, time management, how to handle objections, how to become good on the phone, and you make a lot of friends."
good,Great culture and great facility in Raleigh for Sharefile.  I would not recommend for family person or someone that has already been in business sales with 3-5 years experience.  This is a division of Citrix that does not respect a college degree and does their own thing.  Lead generation  and first line of sales is very robotic.  Management is good but robotic.  Six month attrition rate is less than 25%.  Very large employee turnover first year!
good,"Collaboration within some departments is excellent. Work life balance is non-existent. Nepotism is rampant and job security can be low depending on the department and VP. There are some awesome managers but some have poor leadership skills. Culture fosters innovation, with speed and intensity fast is not fast enough. You can learn a lot and acquire awesome skills. The environment is not for the lazy or faint of heart its a lifestyle."
good,Citrix ShareFile is a fun place to work with an upbeat moral as a team.  The long hours though and minimum pay makes the job non-desirable along with no work life balance.  You are expected to dedicate all of your time to ShareFile yet there is no longer a reward for working 60 hour work weeks.  The job was fun at first when you received a nice commission check but now that a decent commission check is no more the hours are not worth the base pay.  I went from having good money to barely being able to pay bills after the commission restructuring and would only recommend this job to a recent college grad and not a career professional!
good,The products themselves are great.  The culture was horrible no work/life balance.  The senior management team would say one thing and do another.
good,"The team I worked on was great for the most part, the Manager I worked for, needs to have more training, frequently missed one on ones, Not Supportive of training, which hurt my career growth."
good,"Good first post-college job. Long hours, low pay, decent benefits. Really relaxed and casual culture. Company in a current state of flux trying to figure out where its place in the market currently lies. Extremely high turnover, high pressure work place."
good,I've worked at Citrix for 8 years. I've many life long friends there.  There's tons of talented and truly awesome people there.
good,"The company has a good variety of products but could spend more time ensuring top quality.. Management make too many changes, including to job titles."
good,Large scale RIFs occur annually.  Minimal job stability. Political infighting and territory wars hamper projects.  This was quite a learning experience.
good,"Citrix Raleigh is a great place to work, but certain things got to me after awhile.  The people and the perks will keep you happy, but if you're on the sales team, the actual job will suck out your soul."
good,Great Place to work in some departments ... some areas have good work life balance while others don't. Working until midnight on the last day every 3 months and long work hours the week before. Also people are fake and insecure so create a lot of toxicity
good,"no work life balance"
good,"From the first few days there, I knew I would not be a good fit, but had no ""out"" at that point, so I stayed around and tried to do the best I could while there."
good,Great place to gain skill and tools to move forward in your career.  Learned a lot of great skill sets for helping me close deals.  It takes hard work to make it here but you will come away with a great knowledge and understanding of how to sell.
good,"Most days you will have no clue what you are doing and why."
good,"1. Good products and technology"
good,"Had to be willing to work up to 60 hours/week. Hard workers compensated via commission for hours and push they put into the work, but it is a very rigorous structure. First 4 mos is MINIMUM 150 cold calls/day. Doesn't change once you are ""promoted."" Coworkers are great, mostly 23-31 years of age."
good,"Good place to start your career."
good,"this place has a great culture until they find out you have ASD, then they lie to you to get you to do as much work as possible until they can ditch you and find the next 6 month trampoline to use for career advancement"
good,"Overall, Citrix is a great place to work but depending on the department/group that you are in, there are some challenges to deal with. Management is disorganized and unless you are in the 'good ol boys club' you will likely not get the career opportunities that you want and deserve. Work/life balance is a joke especially within Consulting. You are on the road 80-90% of the time making it nearly impossible to achieve any type of balance. That wouldn't be so bad except you are expected to go above and beyond consistently so working nights/weekends become a necessity. If you protest, you are told - that's what you signed up for. They can never keep anyone within Consulting so you are always teaching college kids how to do their job. I have heard great things about other departments within the company so maybe my experience is not shared by a lot of others but just wanted to let everyone know what they are getting themselves into!"
good,"It was good company but I was hired to only be laid off 6 months later. With that being said, I also was told that when they start to rehire people we would be given priority over outside candidates but I never found that to be true because every time I apply, I never hear anything from them."
good,"the local office in my region is small and has no fun activities at all, it purely working environment or office environment,"
good,"I enjoyed my stint until the manager changed. The good thing about Citrix is that it is customer-focused. I had access to Engineering and Product Management, all in all, a customer-focused place."
good,"Culture: Citrix believes in their tag line: work anywhere with flexible remote options."
good,Great place to work.  Very intuitive.  Forward thinking processes.  They sought after the best talent to have the best products.  Very comfortable atmosphere.
good,Working at Citrix use to be fun and exciting.  Now that the company has gotten bigger it has to change and become what mature companies do.  They become slow and ridgid.
good,"Citrix had a productive work environment that included various amenities for their employees such as a food court, gym, tv areas, and even a massage room."
good,Citrix tries hard to get you engaged with your job and coworkers which can seem like 'forced fun' sometimes. Yes they have all the toys and stocked break rooms but the culture they project distracts you from an overall flat organization with limited market and career growth.
good,"Stressful at least for sales. Hit numbers or you will not last long here at all. Constantly making changes. Culture has changed a lot but still pretty good, building, and people are the best part. You have to really want to be here to succeed but it can be very draining."
good,"I had the best coworkers. "
good,"Interesting industry, continually evolving strategy and products.  Most appreciated benefit is being able to work from home -- most employees do so several days a week.  Nice offices, reasonable salaries.  Very US-focused."
good,Excellent training and the people they hire are some of the best folks you'll ever meet. Management will go the extra mile to give you extra training if you ask for it.
good,Working in a MH/SA facility is a great experience because is very interesting in learning how many cultures and behaviors have in common. As well as experiencing how people and grow an cope with their problems.
good,"Citrix is a place that allows employees to enjoy their personal time and freely roam. This is both a great benefit, and it hurts them when people take advantage. More structure, accountability, and leadership are needed to grow."
good,"Interns at Citrix are treated as disposable rather than employees being groomed for full-time work. However, employees at Citrix are very happy and the culture is a lot of fun."
good,"Good company, howev r t I was laid off in the latest round.  Be wary of joining this company. Free soft drinks and snacks.  Good PTO policy.  Management needs to het a clue about motivating employees."
good,I did't like what I did for Citrix but it is a great company. The kitchen has free food and drinks all the time and they bring in breakfast on Wednesdays. You can bring your dog to work and they have ping pong tables!
good,"Cutting edge technology and good benefits for the employees. "
good,"Citrix hasn't handled all the changes within the last several rounds of layoffs very well, and a lot of great people were let go. This has definitely lowered the morale of the folks who are still there."
good,Good team of engineers. Product was not viable. Somewhat of a politically treacherous environment. Navigating it can be quite exhausting.
good,"The communication from leadership is extremely poor but the company culture is nice. The best part of this company is that I am able to work remotely, however they are no longer hiring people to be remote or allowing future remote relocations."
good,"good work life balance. Free food. cab service . good culture."
good,"Working for long hours is hardest part of the job specially out of office hours."
good,Lots of work life balance and very friendly employees but not a very exciting place to work. The San Francisco office is an empty wasteland as is the Santa Clara office.
good,"Citrix was a challenging Place to work."
good,"ShareFile does not care for its employees, They will start everyone in as a appointment setter and dangle the promotion to Sales over your head.  The turnover at ShareFile is very high, During the time I was there 4 months 15 people lost their positions from a team of about 25"
good,"""Great place to learn, flexibility and constant encouragement for growth""."
good,"Laid back and easy place to work."
good,The Citrix Cambridge environment is a little different to the rest of the company. It is staffed with an abundance of very bright Cambridge University graduates and Ph.Ds.
good,"I like the people, however our counterparts in India lack in communication and resolve."
good,"citrix is a small firm giving good support to all."
good,"Good place to learn new technology"
good,This opportunity if for the right type of person. I was recruited and interviewed for what I thought was a different type of position. The company is moving in a direction that did not suit my needs.
good,"Payment is good, however, the stress level is very high. It does not pay the extreme hours and lack of work-life balance."
good,Good company to work. Work life balance is good here. The salary is not at par with industry standards. The management shows favouritism. Not all teams are valued at the same level. Few are given importance and few ignored.
good,"I worked through a temp agency, I did not experience the full benefits of working at Citrix"
good,Company goes through a lot management changes too frequently. Also resulting in frequent changes in priorties for projects often results in wasted efforts for several folks
good,A loosely run corporate culture with primary focus on innovative software development. I worked there in a post IPO environment. As head of investor relations it was fun interacting with the investment community.
good,Citrix provides the right of flexibility but does not keep you at ease in terms of job security these days. With a lot of layoffs for the past years I am not sure if anyone would feel safe about their tenure
good,"I loved the people I worked with and the managers are great but the pay is low, hours are long, making 130 cold calls all day every day gets old. Its real easy to get burned out. The culture is great and thats what made it fun, it is a great first job for anyone fresh out of college. Great experience because of the training managers give you in a fast paced competitive environment. Facilities are great as well."
good,"Citrix is in the process of re-defining itself within the market.  This transition is challenging, and bringing new ideas and processes to the company"
good,"Citrix seems like it is in a constant state of change."
good,"The work/life balance is good but even though we sale virtualization solutions, we are not fully given the flexibility to work remotely. ""Working remotely is a privilege, not your right."""
good,"1. Typical day - meetings - new features or bug fixes"
good,"The people at Citrix are awesome."
good,"Teams were changed up constantly, seats were rearranged monthly, employee turn over rate was so high it made those who made it longer than a month's head spin. Cool technology and very fast paced rewarding sales cycle. Not for the faint or weak."
good,"For about 11yrs Citrix was a fantastic place to work.  Then the change in the Board of Directors made manage inconceivable where teams, people, products were dissected and sold/released etc.  made it tough to know where he company was headed."
good,"Pro: "
good,"Wonderful people. I never encountered anything but some of the nicest, most collaborative people in my career. The company is undergoing a transition as the business moves to being exclusively cloud hosted."
good,In my case my manager was totally absent except at quarterly meetings.  He wouldn't return any of my phone calls or emails.  He only wanted my results.  And very little resources were provided to do the job.
good,"1.Determine Problem ad Narrow to a specific component While managing the customer's expectations for Resolution."
good,"Recent reorganization has drastically changed the culture of Citrix and morale is very low. All metrics driven, although I exceed the numbers, they are not sustainable."
good,The culture is very open and friendly. A typical work day is extremely fast and always busy with a lot of issues. I learned a lot during my time with Citrix regarding process and people management. My only issue is that there is no balance between work and life and management is always changing the rules.
good,"Long days, with management support. Opportunities to improve. Hardest part of the job is the grind, and the long hours not great for work life balance, best part of teh jobs were the amazing people that i got to work with"
good,"In the recent years there have been too many laid off."
good,Grew with this software company from mid sized to large company.  Good culture and working environment.  Management changes as the company has evolved.
good,Solid company. They have market leading products in nearly every category that they are in. The have a assembled a solid team and the people are good to work with.
good,"The company helped me grow in a fast paced environment, it helped me in gaining my confidence and helped me in exploring myself of which path I am going to go through."
good,"The culture at Citrix has changed so much since I started there.  Now all they care about is the bottom line.  You have to have a PHD just to fill out your quarterly performance review.  It takes a whole day to justify your existence with the company. It's the same blah, blah, blah at company meetings.  Nothing ever changes and yet everything changes."
good,Its ok. There is not much special about working here which is both a good thing and a bad thing. I was lucky to have a great manager but thats really a lottery.
good,Fun environment to work in and the people are one of the best workplace communities out there. I've worked there for 9 years now and it will be tough to find something better.
good,"-There typical day was no day was was like the next"
good,"Typical day at work is coming in getting the list you are supposed to call and start working I learned a lot about prospecting and finding ""pain points"" to overcome objections. The culture is very friendly and open but the hardest part of the job is having to call the same prospects over and over on outdated lists with a very ""challenging"" quota. The most enjoyable part of my job is basically ""running my own business"" with no micro-management"
good,"Great company to serve the community, excellent benefits for employees and the salaries are very competitive.  Lots of remote workers so, workday can be long to support East/West coast, Europe and APAC."
good,"Treat people, like people. They over hire people than fire them because their sales teams can't meet their numbers. Provide your employees resources and they will perform. It's as simple as that."
good,Citrix has a boys club / frat house mentality. They are very selective. They do not hire outside people often. The sales team have unattainable quotas
good,"*Ownership - You can provide your opinions and they would be heard."
good,"When first hired, Citrix was an awesome work environment. About two and a half years in, there was a shift and things started changed. It became more of a corporate environment. Alot of managerial changes and rumors of money issues within the company. Eventually, layoffs happened and many were effected."
good,Really a great working atmosphere with lots of cool perks. The job does get a but monotonous and management is very complacent. Great job the first year and big commission changes caused many employees to leave recently
good,"Great company to work for. Ever innovative and great benefits. Bangalore office, where I worked had all the benefits that any employee would need - Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner (Customer support), Fruits, snacks, free transportation etc."
good,"Contract & Vendor management"
good,Citrix has great work life balance.  They do a all for there employees.  You are able to work from anywhere any device.
good,"I worked at Citrix as an intern."
good,"Great company with normal growing pains. You have to make your own career path or you will stay in the same job for a while. "
good,"The company is on a transformation journey, it is has developed a well targetted product strategy.  It is well positioned to partner with their clients for the #FOW."
good,"Produktiver Arbeitsort, neueste Infrastruktur Ausstattung"
good,Low salary for big responsibility hope the company is cutting a lot of travels and team interaction we have to work with low budget for all included customer visits
good,"The workplace is loaded with so many tehcnologies where we can experiment a lot and open to take up with different team tasks. "
good,"This is about business company. The employees unfortunately don't have a lot of care for using appropriate professional words at work, a lot of terrible cussing and management doesn't care. They also have happy hour during work days which I didn't appreciate."
good,"great managers not so great c level management "
good,Nice company.Good work culture.big benefits fro all employees evenn contract employees are like company employess. Nice company.Good employees and HR people are friendly
good,Typical day would include updating cases in salesforce and troubleshoot issues with customers remotely using citrix software.
good,"Work is intense and in a collaborative environment where other employees are willing to help.  During my 9 years there, I survived 2 layoffs but not the 3rd when my position was eliminated.  This layoff cut muscle, not fat, and will impact the survivors.  The corporate culture is changing and people are worried about their jobs who shouldn't be concerned.  Some are looking for new positions and don't trust the company since there's a large churn in senior management."
good,I enjoyed my time at Citrix.  I'm so happy for their success.  Citrix is a great company to work for.  Great company an management.
good,"great creative team"
good,Had a very supportive manager (who is no longer with Citrix) who empowered to take decisions and trusted completely. Good coworkers and learning.
good,"Feels chaotic at times. Weak management overall. Many functions/roles don't have specific deliverable thus they are not held accountable. It feels like a lack of accountability/ownership all around."
good,"worked on google analytics, social media for the company, handled hubspot tool, Tracking on KPI's and metrics of the company."
good,good place to work. lots of opportunities for advancement. leadership was good. lots of collaboration with friendly coworkers. good benefits and accommodating.
good,"Good place to work, but more development is needed on how to integrate product and services teams."
good,"I am learning guy."
good,"Overall fantastic place to work. depending on your dept, there is great oppertunity to advance within this company."
good,Exciting global environment with many projects and opportunities to challenge the status quo.
good,Citrix is a great company to work for however managers certain members of management is unfair
good,"I joined Citrix's online services division (GoToMeeting, GoToWebinar, etc.) to help launch GoToTraining. At the time I joined Citrix Online was growing incredibly fast, with an excellent team and solid products. I loved it. But the business eventually declined due to (IMO) an inability by leadership to recognize and respond to the changes in the web conferencing market. It was a great ride while it lasted but the decline eventually led Citrix to sell the online services division to Logmein."
good,"A good company with many dedicated people.  Like every company, it has it's challenges but overall a good experience."
good,The people at Citrix are great. It's a flexible work environment. It's headquartered in Fort Lauderdale which can sometimes mean it is not the most progressive thinking tech company.
good,"Cirtix has a great work life balance.  While there isn't real ""fun"" at the office, the ability to work from home nearly everyday and travel to the office as needed was a huge plus for me."
good,"Very relaxed atmosphere."
good,"Challenging and forever changing."
good,"In my three years at Citrix I experienced three CEOs and two large layoff cycles. The company doesn't seem to be very stable and they are constantly looking for ways to cut costs for short term profitability instead of long term growth ability. "
good,"daily Scrum meetings with Agile development and process oriented and not just technical cloud first development approach. management is ok. many products to work on networking, database, web server"
good,Company may be sold.  They hired Goldman Saks for find a buyer and fired the Citrix CEO.  They compete with VMWARE in the Virtualization space and vs F5 in the Load Balancer space.
good,"Great learning experience. Company need to evolve from their last 20 years to a new / world class portfolio of products, go-to-market strategy and culture. Status quo and old way to do thing seems to be giving a strong battle at this point."
good,"Citrix welcomes innovation and its culture is open and collaborative. Its environment is certainly global and one can be exposed to diverse teams. Work can be rewarding and at the same time, very demanding and consuming so although there is plenty of flex time, one may be challenged to balance work and life. Change in management and overall restructure can be looked at with a spin towards advancement and add in patience, durability and reinvention. Time flies at Citrix and it's amazing what you will achieve there!"
good,learnes a lot of new concepts and valued each and every minute working with Citrix. A very productive place and poeple to work with.
good,This company offers a professional working environment. Compensation and benefits are good.  They offer good possibilities for training and advancement.
good,"Compensation was fair but changes in the upper management created ambiguity and fear for job security."
good,"Consulting entails traveling to client site, provide SME input, write project documentation.  Good learning experience, a lot of good people, but compensation is minimal."
good,"Interesting, great exposure and learning. Fun team and most enjoyable part is we work as a startup."
good,"I enjoyed working for Citrix for 10 years. I worked with enthusiastic, caring and smart people there."
good,Love to work for this company. It has a great work culture and ethics. People are very friendly.
good,"Good place to work.  Top down management.  Move rather slowly.  Really good people and decent company culture.  Pay well, but then you are pretty much told what to do."
good,Citrix has very good facilities and work life balance allowing flexible hours. Job security may be a concern as there has been multiple re-orgs in the past 3 years impacting many employees
good,Citrix cares about their customers and employees. They strive to be an innovative company always coming up with new ways for people to work anywhere on any device creating a better work life balance for organizations.
good,"Everyone is committed to working as one team.  However, current business makes it difficult for advancement opportunities.  Great work and life balance culture."
good,"Great place to work, amazing atmosphere in the Raleigh office. Hard to hit your number in sales. Typical inside sales, use salesforce, call on leads, hunt. Comfy chairs!"
good,I have been associated with CITRIX for quite soemtime now and the experience has been very satisfying. The technology solutions are well aligned to industry needs and are very compelling to incorporate as part of core IT strategies.
good,Nice workplace but with limited career advancement opportunities.  Coworkers are friendly.  Company benefits are good.  Many changes in management in recent years.
good,"Citrix was a great company to work for when I first arrived. It was a challenge for me but over time it got easier and easier. Management was on point when it came to leading and knowing how to motivate a sales team. That all changed when a certain person came in whose whole goal was to slim us down, I get it you had board to report to but the manner in which it was presented was unreal. We went from being a great sales organization to one being lead by fear. Of course everyone knows about the massive 200 person lay off which I know now is par for the course with companies like this. It is never easy however it still was hard to be a part of and see others being laid off."
good,"Company open culture is USP"
good,"I have nothing bad to say about my job at Citrix. It was a great job, work culture among sales reps and my department (Customer Success) was good, pay was fine, but not amazing. My team was dissolved, so I was laid off. I didn't mind my immediate manager, and the manager above that. The Director I wish would have been more friendly."
good,good work life balance for people with families.   fast paced work environment.    very talented work force.  decent work place culture.  unstable management in recent years.
good,"Citrix culture was born out of IBM so they can come across as a bit stuffy at times.  I found my co-workers to be very friendly and willing to provide guidance, and suggestions when asked. My managers were equally helpful and provided the proper amount of career guidance.   Everyone is very willing to lend a helping hand.   There were plenty of opportunities to work on stretch goals to improve yourself professionally."
good,Great company to work for. Very well established company with great products and really great customers. One of the global leaders in the market. They are going through many changes within the organisation and things are changing rapidly.
good,다른 한국의 외국계 회사의 APAC 사무실이 홍콩에 있는 것에 비해 이 회사는 주로 싱가폴과 호주에 나눠져서 있습니다. 여기 직원들과 많은 업무를 하였습니다.
good,"Citrix has some outstanding and very nice people.  They excel at alliances and ""punch above their weight"" in the market place.  CEO transitions have hampered the company and it has effectively moved most of its operations to Ft Lauderdale.  Overall a good place to work."
good,"Lost of change, lots of opportunities, fast paced."
good,Citrix Systems is a great company to be employed with.  They provide one of the best benefit and compensation packages.  You'll have the opportunity to grow with Citrix and be innovative.  Co-workers are for most of the time helpful.  Hardest part of working with  them is meeting the unreal deadlines because of technical blocking.
good,"Although sometimes sloppy and sluggish in its internal operations, Citrix is a credible threat to the likes of VMWARE and anyone vying for the remote apps, machine, and cloudspaces."
good,"Ho lavorato nella divisione Servizi come Consultant.  In questo ruolo si lavora per i clienti intorno all'80% del tempo ed il restante 20% è possibile lavorare in sede."

good,"Citrix provides employees with the ability with good work/life balance including the ability to work from home, as needed. This allows employees to take care of their home life which in turn makes them more productive as an employee."
good,"Great people. Good work , life balance. Decent pay and benefits. Upper management was starting to lose trust of employees due to recent decisions and lay offs."
good,"Worked in the accounting group. Very structured and organized. Not much room for advancement past a senior role, but work was fun and the people were great. Was fairly compensated."
good,"Great atmosphere due to committed and talented people. Let down by micro management by some of the senior managers. "
good,The cultural aspect of the place specially where i'm located is quite good. The company does suffer on providing growth opportunities. Even changing to different department is complex since more departments already expect personal with lot of experience.
good,"Great Company, well planned out processes and workflows. Middle management was the reason for departure. Company offers a ton of opportunity to advance and grow"
good,"Fun comfortable place to work, very modern and upbeat.  Several challenges in management and deployment but the overall company was very easy to work with."
good,Capacité à laisser les employés de délivrer leurs engagements en assumant la responsabilité pleine et entière quant aux moyens à mettre en oeuvre et les chemins à prendre pour réaliser les objectifs financiers.
good,I loved Citrix until some of their policies changed and made it much more difficult to get paid well and raised the stress level of the position. The management is a little bit young and I think therefore may not always make the best information
good,"I worked at Citrix for 9 years, had a great career and made lots of great friends. Leadership team has changed in the past few years and therefor, the company has also changed."
good,"A typical day at Citrix is very stress-less. I enjoy being part of such a fun company, too bad my field isn't in the same industry as my company so I'm not able to advance my career in Citrix."
good,Citrix is a great place for work and life balance. The most of the products here are acquired from others so for the older products some saturation point has come and so not getting that good work in core teams.
good,"A typical day involves making cold calls, performing product demonstrations, managing a sales pipeline and staying up to date with industry specific knowledge. "
good,"Good work life balance. "
good,"Good company to work for. Successful products."
good,"Flexible working hours"
good,good place to work where you can learn multiple technologies.
good,"It's a good company, lots of great software engineers and architects"
good,Citrix was a great learning experience for me. The company invests heavily in training and is very flexible about where you work from. Recent changes in Sr. Management have made this company not nearly as attractive for the sales teams.
good,"Good environment to work.. supportive"
good,"Great opportunities with Citrix. I left on good terms to relocate somewhere other than where I was born and raised. Very fun culture and training constantly since technology is always changing. If you work hard and follow instruction, you will thrive. This company will give you the tools to make you all that you can be. Keep the accelerator down and don't get distracted. After all, it's a Fortune 500 Company with plenty of nice amenities. You'll learn something new every day about work and life in general. Be appreciative as I was and you'll fit in just fine. I love Citrix."
good,"Snacks and drinks available for all. Other things available for full time, non-contractors such as a gym and deck parking. Full 8 hours of work with 1 hour of lunch for a 9 hour day. I learn schedule adherence and customer service. Learned how to use their product. Workplace is relaxed yet structured at the same time."
good,"Technical support and troubleshooting"
good,"as a contractor you start working getting paid only $15 an hour, and they may only offer another opportunity to become effective after 3 years, then your salary starts at $20 an hour. but as a contractor we dont have the same benefits as an effective employee."
good,"Very professional and challenging environment. Employees are committed to doing the best possible job."
good,I enjoyed my time working at Citrix. I very much enjoyed the work environment and the pace of the job. High volume with many detailed oriented decisions inside of the organization.

good,"Ample chances to learn new cutting edge technologies. Management needs to have clear and focused vision. "
good,"Citrix is the definition of ""Work hard, play hard"". It's an amazing opportunity for entry level sales skills that would benefit you throughout a sales career or in any other career. It's definitely a grind, but you grind as a team."
good,"Citrix afforded me the opportunity to showcase my analytical skills in various ways.  I was given a platform for building dashboards, predictive models, ad hoc reports, etc."
good,This is a very family friendly company.  Employees have good work life balance and great benefits.  The management ensure that workers are well motivated.  They encourage volunteering and provide time off to do that.
good,"Great place to work lots of room for growth busy and fast pace days learned that a good company is willing to teach and mold their employees management is in tune with employee and company needs and do all they can to have both meet in the middle."
good,A very vibrate network of intelligent people from all over the world. You work and gain experience at an enterprise level that comes only from working with a large company with complex development strategies.
good,"Having worked at the Citrix Startup Accelerator for about 18 months, i can safely say that this was a great place to learn more about startups and corporate innovation. There were lots of travel opportunities and an ability to network with senior executives within the company and across the Fortune 1000. Not so much focus on employee development and advancement and currently, lots of restructuring taking place internally."
good,"The company is slowed down by lazy folks living in places without job opportunities. Thus, They do their best to stay employed and keep the company from changing from a very old outdated paradigm."
good,Get to learn new things everyday. Very challenging products and technology. Very strong software teams and sales. The Support organization lacks resources but very talented engineers to work with
good,"Requesting circuit quotes from RBOC"
good,"Typical Day Work-"
good,Citrix is an awesome company with great opportunity for advancement while always staying ahead of the curve with their technologies and acquisitions.
good,"Definitely a fast-paced, constant change kind of place with lots of potential opportunities. The politics can be a bit thick so you either need to play the game or figure out how to rise above. There are some great people at Citrix and they still take care of their employees (free snacks, breakfast on Friday mornings). With Mark T's pending retirement there is change in the air and I fear the focus will shift from great people delivering cool technology to just the numbers."
good,"Citrix is a phenomenal company to work for but their Sales team Lead Gen program is a brutal boot camp, it is an excellent training program and has prepared me for the world very well. However, I am not the best salesman on the phone and we had to call 150 people a day before leaving, these were 10-12 hour days and cold-calling was just not my thing. Other than disliking the position, I have nothing but great things to say about the people I worked with and the company. That being said, I just found that my interests have stuck with Analytics instead."

good,Drive company but a lot of turnover from the time I was there. Not necessarily in a bad way though. I just believe a lot of people didn't realize what they were signing up for.
good,"Nice place to work, good culture. Salary in competitive to the market. Work on cutting edge technology. We have logs of facilities in the campus and good environment to work."
good,Lots of flexibility with work schedule; able to work from where you are and not expected to be in the office everyday depending upon your role. I would definitely recommend Citrix to a friend.

good,"I think at the bigger offices, they would be a 5 star, but I was based in the Dallas office and there is a feeling of isolation in that office.  the products are great, however, selling the product day-to-day is very tough only because the competition is so very, very stiff compared to other things I have sold and this adds stress."

good,"Working for Citrix in tech support and education is like drinking from a fire hose. The volume of information flowing through that place is crazy, and you have to learn how to absorb what you need immediately and leave the rest for study later. It was a real challenge to keep up and then excel. Favorite things: the motto was ""work hard, play hard"" and that was certainly the case. Serious parties followed the brainbreaking weeks. I really enjoyed working with customers all over the world to solve problems, get answers and teach them something new. The hardest parts (besides the volume of data) were those customers who we couldn't help for whatever reason, and the management. Lots of inexperienced managers in there who got intimidated by their staff, which is a problem when your staff tends to be seriously smart geeks. "
