bad,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WORKING HERE."
bad,PC Connection is for the company and not its employees. There was no work home life balance when working here. Your position and growth is based on who you know and not what you know.
bad,"Worst place to work, very bad training, the supervisor or manager do not help you when you need assistance (DO NOT WORK THERE) "
bad,Extremely corrupted culture. It starts from the HR and ends with the Upper Management. Hiring process is totally broken. Psychological abuse is a norm in this company.Nothing would change even you inform the Upper Managemnt.
bad,"Worst place ever to work.  Would not recommend anyone to work here if you want growth.  Management is not worried about employee as growth, only for getting numbers out and only selected few people will grow with company"
bad,I worked there  as a temp but got ft hours then when that client was over they pick and choose who they want.they don't listen to you throws it under rug
bad,"Management said one thing, but did another. No support. Low moral. Account managers are king. No professionalism from VPs to HR. The most strangest place I've ever worked. Will miss some of the people, but not the office politics."
bad,"The favoritism at Connection is unreal! If your manager doesn’t like you, you’re not going to make it. They will tell you that you’ll make $100,000 after your 3rd year but that’s a lie. Base is 40k your first year, 38k your second year, 36k your 3rd year, 30k after 3 years. Who can survive on that?! The commission is bogus! The director sits in his office all day and has zero personality. He’s very unfair and a jerk!"
bad,Very low base salary to survive on when months are slow. No room for advancement after several attempts. You can lose your accounts anytime at companies discretion. No equal distribution of accounts when someone leaves. Accounts with good spend always go to firmly established reps doing well already. Rich get richer. Make you sign a non compete which prohibits you from working in the it industry for 18 months. Basically you starve for 18 months if this was your only field of expertise.
bad,"Lack of leadership or any clear strategy lead to infighting, political back stabbing, and a toxic culture.  Morale was about as low as can be measured."
bad,"The company environment is highly toxic.  Management lacks leadership skills and does not work together towards common goals. "
bad,"A typical day: No specific duties.  Management change processes and jobs on a daily basis."
bad,"Connection is a very ""Micro Managed"" company. They listen to your phone calls behind your back as well as plugging into your phone at your desk.  They scan your emails also. So, watch what you say to other co-workers. A typical day is making phone calls whether they are voice messages or not, long as you get them in. Management pays favoritism. It is, noticeable as well. Workplace culture is set up to fail. The hardest part of the job is to get the managers to help you because they are to busy helping their favorites. The best part is going home and vacation."
bad,I worked here for almost two years.  The supervisors were very disrespectful and unprofessional.  As well as the lead in hunan resources.  They harrassed me daiky and disrespected me as well as other agents.  It was a very bad work enviornment.
bad,"In less than 2 years I have seen over 40 people leave in the sales/account manager sector.  It is a revolving door.  Most likely because there is no training, lack of appreciation, sexism, favoritism, and from the very beginning they lie.  Don't be fooled by their promises of great commission, work from home opportunities, bonuses, promotions, training, structure or any kind of accountability from management because none of it exists...or  I guess I should say it may if they like you and you are a favorite...the culture is so sad perhaps from the revolving door of people coming and leaving.  It's hard to make friends when people only stick around for a few months.  Your pay goes down each year as an account manager and your commission...a mere 3% doesn't make up for it.  Oh and they take 2.5% of that 3% commission when you use services like the renewal team, which actually whether or not you use them or if they refuse to assist you...they still take the 2.5% commission from you.  They find every way possible to take commission from you."
bad,Connections give you a set pay and it’s very hard to advance/ get a promotion. Don’t voice your opinion you will lose hours not a great Place to advance in a career
bad,Selling and teaching people electronics.  Cashing customers out with thier purchases including electronics or from other parts of the store. Work all holidays besides Christmas.
bad,"Management is absolutely terrible. They hold you down and don't let you progress even after bending over backwards for them for 3 years. They don't promote any kind of positivity. No team outings, no team lunches, no team parties allowed, no recognition whatsoever. What they do promote is favoritism though. Certain departments are allowed to do certain things when other departments are not. Manager also doesn't practice what he preaches and goes against his own rules. Wouldn't even recommend this company to my enemies."
bad,"There continues to be a significant gap of communication between the administration and program levels, which creates additional challenges in the workplace."
bad,"The company itself is not a bad firm. There are quite a few positive and supportive people that work here. Unfortunately, the Services  PMO is a hostile work environment with an unsupportive, toxic culture. This culture is  caused by a lot of undermining and backstabbing, which several employees participate in. They are not entirely at fault for their behavior. The Manager of the Services PMO intentionally encourages this behavior to retain power and control over their department. They will throw anyone who poses a threat to their power / control under the bus (including go getter types, highly qualified types, type As, and men). They will use others to survive another day, never taking any sense of personal responsibility. They are completely untrustworthy. Besides this department, the rest of the company seems to be a decently healthy place. The Help Desk and WebSpoc departments are pretty cool, and run with positive, collaborative cultures. The managers of these departments are true leaders."
bad,Benefits and pay are awesome but come with a cost. There is a frat mentality.  Very clicky. If you go against the grain you are singled out. There is room to grow but the director has to give the ok. Which he usually doesnt. HR definitely doesnt have your back. You can complain to them all you want and they never do anything. Everyone plays favorites.
bad,The main objective is to sell hardware. That being said the consistently try to drill into all sales folks the it is really about creating a complete solution with a large emphasis on service.
bad,"Company has opportunities that can be lucrative, however they seem more concerned with how much time you spend at your desk vs. how much revenue you create."
bad,"Let me just preface this by saying I was a model employee who exceeded their sales targets consistently every month. Overall this company is great and I enjoyed the environment i was in and all my coworkers. It was like a little family, which turned out to be a curse to new employees. The starting salary is horrendous for a inside sales job ($32,500) with bridge payments ($10,000) that decrease every year for 3 years. The commission structure is set up to reward the longer tenured employees who have established Enterprise accounts. After grinding and creating a solid book of business and being on pace to bring in over a million dollars for the year, I had nothing to show for it. My best month I made $500 in commissions after selling close to 200k in products. After doing research into similar companies this is the worst commission structure for the type of work we do. The other problem is how close all the older tenured employers are. Most of the people in our office have been working together for over 5 years with no new hires. With that being said, there was a lot favoritism within management to give the active buying accounts to their closest friends instead of spreading out to people who consistently show up and work hard. The company has a great future, but they need to adapt to the times and compensate emoyees equally to what the competition is."
bad,"Good company overall that is moving in the right direction, although slowly.  It is a good place to be for scheduling flexibility where needed, and its nice not to have to do the Boston commute."
bad,Sales Managers have their favorites. If you stand up for yourself its frowned upon. HR never backs you up or keeps their word. Its like a good ol boys club. Not much room for advancement
bad,"Connection's Corporate Office in Merrimack should keep a close eye on this location.  It is a very toxic and hostile work environment.  Instead of collaboration, teams tend to back-stab each other and look for blame instead of solving issues."
bad,"Employer provides benefits that should be ""standard"" in 2017. Health Insurance, Dental, Vision, Gym Reimbursement, 401k, Stock Options, etc."
bad,"The training is 8 weeks and mostly do it yourself virtual training. You are rushed from one training to the next with alot of information being thrown at you and not given ample time to digest . You are expected to make calls before knowing much about what products and services are offered. Its more of a glorified telemarketing position . The sales manager being new was unable to support us when system questions arose because he was learning right along with us. He was overbearing, rude, impatient and not a motivator. I found it distractingly  noisy as you are in small cubicles in close proximity to others talking. "
bad,"Best part of the job was co-workers, pay wasn't good, most management was clueless on changes that was happening, and there was plenty of ""friend"" favoritism between management and CSR's. There was always drama and conversations that weren't fit for a work place. Job is extremely easy, yet very boring. However it seemed most working there couldn't grasp the most basic concepts of the job, but the few that could were expected to do their own job plus answer questions from numerous employees who didn't pay any attention in training. And if you were one of those who knew your job, if you were asked by another employee what to do but couldn't jump to answer them expect attitude not only from the co-worker but also supervisors."
bad,"Get ready to prospect. I would figure on 12-18 months to build a decent customer base. Focus on services, data center, and any software that can be invoiced."
bad,"A typical day involves solving email and sales case issues relating to cost and quote information to help sales cost the item correctly."
bad,"This can be a great place pending the economy is stable. The managers are great, provided that your sales are above the daily goal. If the economy dips the managers put you in a position that you fear your job. This place is hit or miss, with the right clients you will go far, the management is great, as long as you are a top performer."
bad,"The job site was unsustainable as the network had not been updated since 1989! "
bad,"The work was always hard, and the pay was low to start. But after a few years of proving myself, income started to follow the hard work. Had two very good years back to back."
bad,"I was young and naive when I accepted this job.  What it did teach me was what a company should not be doing,  For it wouldn't be without this experience here at Connection that I now know what a positive work environment is, and should be."
bad,"You have to love cold calling and all that comes with it. Unrealistic metrics as they could care less if you make 1,000 calls as they only care about talk time. Goals go up fast and they get on you fast about metrics. You do learn a lot about products and I have to say their training people are very very good. You get the free food and stuff from vendors but not worth the emotional stress."
bad,"Very fast paced,lots of overtime! It is a great place to cut your teeth on a new IT career & get abilty to additonal certifactions to pad your resume."
bad,"An out-of-date compensation plan with beyond reasonable monthly goals will most likely end with a termination somewhere between 2-3 years of dedicated service to your potential and existing clients and to this Fortune 500 organization.  Share-holders matter and that ultimately leads to ""voluntary separation"" packages being offered to employees who are the newest hires in Corporate and Small Business Sales."
bad,"This used to be a nice place to work at. Then, management changed and everything started to go downhill. The director will change his mind 10 times and you never know what you're doing or where you're going to end up. There is no communication what so ever."
bad,I enjoy talking on the phones what I don't like is when the systems go down .I learn different ways to take a call me and my coworkers often work together.
good,"Company cannot afford to move into the way of the future, being as that it's still located on the fifth floor of an almost abandoned building on second street of Jamestown after being ""open"" for ten years in the area."
good,"The job itself was ok, but my manager was like a middle-aged frat boy (ever seen the movie ""Old School?""). Real ""Bro"" mentality, and if you're the right kind of person, you get lots of support and awesome leads - so if that's the kind of environment you enjoy, this is the perfect place for you. I didn't fit in."
good,Great experience out of college or just trying to get your foot in the door. There are lots of changes happening however it is not a steady work flow. It is a feast or famine work flow.
good,Inconsistent directives from upper management make it difficult to maintain a consistent message to the agents on the production floor.
good,client transport- Parole interaction- DOC interaction- performing urine test to inmates/ clients- setting up individual service plans- adhering to HIPA compliance
good,"Connection (then called PC Connection) is a B2B reseller of IT products and related services. I was a top achiever there after one year, and won awards during my stay...bother for hitting sales targets and also gross margin targets."
good,This was an underpaying sales job. There are managers who cannot perform the day to day tasks they ask of their own employees. No room for advancement.
good,"I worked for Connection for 4 years, and even though the President recommended movement within the organization, rather than being stuck in a low ball position, it was not offered in my case and felt like I was being held down and no promotions."
good,"Training by a Fire hose is best example, a bit of a disconnect from training to manager you work for. If you like to be managed and make more phone calls than you could ever expect is a good fit for you."
good,"Very simple, when someone leaves their accounts stay within the team. 90+% of the time accounts are distributed fairly, but holding on until folks leave is the challenge. Finding net new accounts is a challenge but not impossible, the time frame that they want you build your book without any attrition is the real challenge. Most fail."
good,"You just need to keep your head down and do your work. It's a fast-paced environment, everyone works keeping information very close.  No two days are the same."
good,"Training program was referred to by your coaches as ""drinking from the firehose"", clearly not well thought out as you are not retaining half of the information delivered. If you are struggling and need guidance from your manager, forget about it.  They want you in your seat hitting the phones, they have no desire to coach you (they will deny this however I lived it).  My ""sales coach was less than competent and steered me in the wrong direction more that right direction. If you are not buddy buddy with your manager forget about getting accounts when your coworkers leave, even if you have a relationship with those clients.  Favoritism is the way of life, rules are bent for some and enforced for others."
good,"The job requires extensive cold calling with very little compensation. Management tries to make it enjoyable but the revenue just  isn't there."
good,"A typical work day involved making at least 60 cold calls and talking with customers and potential customers for over 2 hours per day to build your portfolio of business.  This seems like a really doable task when you are interviewing, but it actually takes a lot of work to achieve those metrics.  The good news is you receive extensive training in your first year to help you become successful in the role.  You also have a sales coach in your office to help you find your way."
good,Current sales management inexperienced and micro managing is a problem. Expects sales staff to work much longer hours than scheduled.
good,"They do a lot for the employee and there are a lot of perks but the pay is rough until you make it after a year or two, then you see some return. If you can make it that long. Lots of turn around."
good,Good company with India staff running their IT side. Worked remote from home migrating satelite office takeover to Timberline. never met the bosses who were based somewhere in the mid west.
good,"As a Customer Service Representative, I was the initial point of contact with the customers. After listening to the customer and discussing any concerns, I assessed the issues, using the systems data software with respect to the company policies. I resolved and escalated issues, as appropriate. I completed all required documentation, including notations of all conversations and correspondence. That was what I learned and enjoyed doing."
good,"My day consists of making 60-100 dials and having anywhere from 2.5 hours of talk time and up. You are calling into new prospective buying accounts while maintaining current customer needs."
good,"Lots of potential for earning, but success is only for those that have an extensive EXISTING knowledge of IT already.   I was from another company that was acquired and management was not flexible with newly acquired employees."
good,I manage the paperwork with the orders that come through our warehouse. The management has changed a lot in the last year. My coworkers are great people to work with. The hardest part of my job would be processing international orders. I have to do all the paperwork and documents on all the orders that come through the warehouse.
good,"This is great place to get a start, but if you are looking to establish a long term career this is not the place for you.  Atmosphere was fun and this is a enjoyable place to work.  Benefits are decent, but pay is not competitive to other companies for the same type of work."
good,"Overall, it is a great place to work, if you don't like to be micro managed. I loved working here until my manager decided to ""change"" things up by sticking to the work hours, and managing everyone's day to day life."
good,In charge of training new employees on computer technology.  Starting with a basic computer to networking.  All the way to storage and network security.
good,"I can focus and get the things done necessary for my day to day business."
good,"Worked with this employer for a short time as it was a seasonal job. The job was OK to work seasonal for but not something I would have wanted to make a career out of,"
good,"Liked the job, too many metrics that dont matter. Sales goals dont matter, its how many people you call above all else. Its a shame because they claim to be different than the bigger competitors and they arent."
good,I like to be busy and productive because I like challenges and want to find out the solution for the challenge that I get. Over all I want to be productive in what ever challenges I get.
good,"I have worked there for almost two years. However, I just received an official letter stating that my job termination goes into effect 1/8/2017. I have gotten into trouble but that was my own fault and I suffered the consequences. Would receive inbound phone calls anywhere from 20-60 depending on the day. Coworkers are what you could say as ""average"". You have some that enjoy their job and others that are just there to earn money but complain about the work. The hardest part of the job would be the point system for attendance. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to satisfy customers, even though we can't please them all. Managers are a range of characters."
good,Local management is good but culture of company can be improved as whole for more investment into their personnel and infrastructure and atmosphere
good,I enjoyed working with all the different people and had a steady schedule that was considerate of my personal needs as well as my daughters personal needs.
good,PC Connection is a fortune 500 sales organization that is very fast paced and is a direct competitor with some of the top re-sellers in the country. The environment is very competitive and it is difficult to get started but if you can find customer sit can be very rewarding both financially and personally.
good,Talented people and long term sales staff in place that is truly customer relationships.
good,I worked as a temp and learned a lot. Good company to work for.
good,"In working with this organization I have experienced some, staff member that are not concern about the subordinates and are under skilled in the way of managing people."
good,PC Connection as an outstanding training program that gives you the tools necessary to succeed in IT sales.
good,"Working at the connection is not horrible, however after 2 and a half years, I am ready to find something new. Typically, my average day includes answering phone calls and emails from parents filling out Financial Aid forms for private schools. This can be stressful at times, however it is nice being able to help children go to nice schools."
good,answered incoming and made outgoing phone calls to build a territory and hit sales goals.
good,"Very versatile workplace, allowing great career knowledge and job growth. I felt the compensation and benefits were better than many in the industry. There was plenty of opportunities to have success as an employee there, but each individual needed to take ownership of what path they wanted to pursue. I was sad when our division was merged to an out of state location."
good,"There are good areas of the company and there are not so good areas, unproductive and stressful.  The trick is to figure out which is which and how to make sure that culture is maintained.  "
good,"At my time with this company I learned a lot on how to better adapt, plus increased my customer service skill to another level frm which I started at."
good,"There is a small base salary + commission and spiffs. Technology has changed dramatically and this has caused the company to shift the focus from transactional to project/service base. There have been challenges in the transition and it is much more difficult to mmeet your numbers and make a living."
good,"I was an account manager to start then moved up from there. I felt like the sales goals were unattainable so i basically never hit goal. I was encouraged by my first manager but when i moved up, i was practically ignored all the time. My manager just didnt have time for me.  I left because i was doing so many people's jobs and only getting paid for 1. I never received recognition after i moved up. I should've stayed an account manager  but thats tough too."
good,"Typical day as an Inside SA.  You start your day by double checking your web ex meetings with customer's. Making sure any details are handled. Handle and bill of materials need for customers. Build out the sales quote and past it on to sales rep. Find a balance with handling sales calls and certifications we are required to have. "
good,I learned a great deal while working for this company.  I would have to say that I learned more at this agency than at any other agency I have ever worked at.
good,"A good company with friendly people. The work environment is friendly, but the work itself is tedious. You are given a book of business full of accounts that have already been looked through. You are going to need to find other accounts on your own and none of the ones you have are buying."
good,I love to work with the dentist and coworkers job was great as well. I would not consider going back because there were problems with improper training in the dental department
good,Excellent opportunities to work and grow employees in your sales group.  Opportunities to make commissions based on managing relationships with clients.
good,"Was a great agency, Has multiple facilities that you could travel to, and they always have hours. The facilities give incetives for you picking up hours"
good,"I like the job and the people, the pay is good for a start, I work alone and it gets stressful at times,but I find myself comfortable with it."
good,"On an average day I clean restrooms including, sweeping and mopping as well as taking out the trash. I then go to office rooms and clean throughly. I have learned patience when dealing with clients and other new faces I see on the day to day. I enjoy meeting new people and sharing brief conversation and small talk."
good,"Very easy place to work at, almost anyone can be trained adequately and as long as you show up prepared for the job and follow direction, you can easy advance to additional training. They fall short with management and job security."
good,"A typical day involves getting minimum talk times. Goals Ramp up quickly and a lot is expected of you in acquiring new accounts. Even if you meet sales goals, if you are not bringing in new business every month, you will be put on Performance Improvement Plans, quickly. Though they advertise that they have a new year long training program with room to grow, they will expect you to be a performer out of the gate. It also helps if someone leaves or is promoted on your team and you are able to get one or some of their buying accounts. Training program is excellent and can open up many opportunities for future employment. Companies certainly like to hire former PC Connection employees. Chat up the Gatekeeper or call vendor support to keep your job."
good,"I would not like to comment on my current workplace and place of employment, I am still working there and would not like to influence anyone's opinion concerning Connection,"
good,"This is a great company for anyone in the Technology field. Great benefits, perks and people. The company really takes interest in the staff, with training, opportunities and help in growing your book of business"
good,"Place shut it's doors after losing funds"
good,The company invested in their infrastructure so the they could provide better service and products to their customers.  Excellent exposure to early online product sales.
good,This place taught me how to even smile while on the phone with customers they really made realize how imporatant  it is o always make a customer feel welcome
good,"A typical day at work was taking calls and assisting consumers with general questions regarding health insurance. Learned more about State health insurance policies and helped to improve customer service skills. Management tried to keep it a positive and fun place to work. I liked most of the people I worked with, but didn't socialize with anyone outside of work. I would have to say staying calm with upset customers was definitely the most difficult. My supervisor at time of employment was what I enjoyed the most."
good,Team effort in the recovery of the residents. Staff willing to share other staff member's opinions on strategies for recovery.
good,"I learned a lot at PC Connection, including high-volume cold calling and lead generation. It is a high energy situation with a lot of exposure to vendors. It can also be quite noisy. The managers did not consistently follow ""rules of engagement."""
good,Fast pace environment with plenty of specialist to help you through the sales process.
good,Pc Connection is one of the Nations top provider of IT solutions for business and consumer needs.
good,"Maintaining and AR Portfolio under 60 days. Worked closely with the Sales, Tax, Cash, Billing, Customer Service, and Credit Depts. The hardest part is waiting for someone else to complete their job so you can complete yours. The most enjoyable part is being able to work in a healthy enviroment with positive people."
good,Connection is a good place to get in and learn the world of sales. It is very hard to build a book of business with the resources given. No face to face with the customers because it is all inside.
good,Connection provided the services they said they would and are a decent temporary agency. They were rather hands off on the contract and provided minimum support.
good,Maintained an account base for many large manufactures.  Handling multiple daily incoming calls. Researched and scheduled deliveries for their production.  Following up to make sure product was delivered.  Tracking back ordered deliveries.
good,"Een bedrijf met een gemoedelijke sfeer. Ook bij onze opdrachtgever heb ik het erg naar mijn zin. Onderling met andere vestigingen zijn we heel flexibel, wat bezetting betreft. Of ik nou in Doetinchem , Nijmegen of Arnhem werk inhoudelijk is het allemaal het zelfde. dat vind ik wel een van de leuke dingen aan deze functie bij deze opdrachtgever!"
good,"Enjoyed working for myself bidding jobs, working for Doctors in Pine Bluff.  Hardest part of job was finding responsible workers.  I enjoyed working my own hours and the persons I did the work/jobs for."
good,"Every day work check the structural drawing review the type of connection are provided, such shear connection , moment connection , classified, extra. learn the design knowledge , management was good, work place culture is also good,"
good,Connection is a solid publically traded company. The Corporate Culture is excellent. The professionalism and the collective efforts to reach common goals is amazing. The compensation however is not that good considering the size of the company.
good,"Process clients request. Managed Hardware and Software assets."
good,"prospecting accounts, I have learned a lot about technology and sales through extensive schooling with PCC, Hardest part of the job is getting the person to respond, I enjoy the challange and have done very well at every level being promoted twice"
good,"Perform customer service over the phone and in person. Basic cooking and cleaning responsibilities. make prompt and safe delivery. hardest part would be the unpredictable pay and the most enjoyable part is the relaxed work environment,"
good,Fair company to work for.  Wages are under par. Health benefits were very good. Management team was on the east coast but it was not difficult to contact them.
good,"I manage 5 case manager's at a Re- Entry program."
good,"As a case manager I meet with clients to discuss their goals and counsel them on the negative affects of substance abuse. I conduct LSI interviews as well as ASUS reports, discuss PREA and confidentiality."
good,"It was very good company to work for."
good,"Aprendi a ter controle emocional, a ser prestativa compreensiva e ter habilidades , proativa , sabendo lidar com problemas e tentar resolve-los da melhor forma possível visando o bem de ambas as partes , agilidade,atenção  são atributos que obtive .."
good,The amount of knowledge and skills available to learn was amazing.  I have grown so much from what I have learned from working here.  There are many different roles within the configuration lab and you are able to work your way up through all of them and learn many different skills.
good,"Contact office for jobs available for the day. Pick and choose what I wanted to work on, then go to customer site and give them an estimate on the work they wanted done. I f they accepted we'd set start date and perform the work. Only reason leaving is business closed their doors."
good,"If you like to learn about technology and work side by side with cutting edge tech vendors, this is a great job for you. Desire to learn and adapt is vital to this industry. Must have a passion for prospecting and cold calling."
good,"When Connection purchased our company (Softmart), the established sales reps took a huge pay cut.  The current salary is not competitive in our local area.   There is minimal chances for advancement in our location. My supervisors were great."
good,Great group of people to work for the client we worked at was just as good. The job was challenging and fast paced and rewarding. :eft because of merger and another opportunity which I regret.
good,Connection is a wonderful place to begin and expand my career. It offers a wide variety of careers and potential to move in the direction that you would like to end up.
good,I spent 19 years at Connection and the people is what makes it a great company.  I learned so many things at this company.  The culture is great.  The hardest part of the job is learning all the different areas of the company and so many people coming and going.
good,I would work there again. Management is wonderful and the chance to move up is plentiful. Very easy to aplly and they will walk you through it.  Grwat company.
good,the connection was privately owned by one man. he knew hundreds  of drivers by name. the kind of man you enjoyed working for. he appreciated what you did for him and the company. when he retired his sons were  not the man he was they sold the copmany to Saia motor freight. Saia's attitude was diffrent drivers were replaceable and not valued.
good,"I liked that I was able to work at my own pace because I was a full time college student at the time of employment. I also liked that I was able to be creative with my ideas when executing certain tasks, and I was able to gain some hands-on experience in different positions beyond being an executive assistant."
good,"Great starting place for sales, but also a high tenure rate due to ability to build your own business.  Great job for anyone starting out a career in sales or interested in the tech industry.  Pay is a little low to start, but really scales quickly if you do well.  Good training program and they will work to try and make you successful here as it is in everyone's best interest.  Management is pretty good overall, but is a bit dependent on the person.  You will learn a ton here and can make a career with very good pay, but upward mobility can be tough due to limited opportunities."
good,Enjoyed my time here. Great benefits and spiffs. Casual dress allowed often. You have to be able to call cold and grow your own business. Some of it is luck the rest is determination.
good,"Ambiente legal, responsáveis atenciosos. Tudo bem organizado e trabalhos definidos."
good,Good Company to work for but was downsizing contract and did not hire after 90 days due to knowing was going to layoff so did not get accrued vacation and sick pay
good,"A typical day insisted of answering phone calls for many known clients and providing customer/technical services. It helped me learned a lot about communicating with people and how to provide efficient assistance. Managers were good people and were always there to help. All my co-workers enjoyed their work and provided assistance to each other when needed. I would say the hardest part of the job for me was having to sit down the entire shift, and the most enjoyable was being able to help people and making sure things went well for them."
good,"Great place to work, very busy fun place to work. Bused tables all day and helped servers when it was needed. Also the have great food."
